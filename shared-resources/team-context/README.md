## WhatsApp Exports

Monthly exports of the "AAA Agency" WhatsApp group chat. These provide context on team discussions, decisions, and coordination.

### Export Instructions

1. Open WhatsApp > "AAA Agency" group
2. Tap group name > Export Chat
3. Select "Without Media" for text-only (smaller file)
4. Unzip and place `_chat.txt` in `whatsapp-exports/YYYY-MM/`

### Media Files

Full exports with media (~200MB) are stored locally at:
`/Users/mekaielabdullahi/Downloads/WhatsApp Chat - AAA Agency.zip`

Media is excluded from git to keep repo lightweight. Reference the zip if you need photos, audio, or videos from the chat.

## Privacy

This folder is gitignored to keep team communications private.
