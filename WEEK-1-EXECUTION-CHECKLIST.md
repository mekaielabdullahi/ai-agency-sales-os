## COMMON QUESTIONS & ANSWERS

**Q: What if I don't book any calls this week?**
A: Don't panic. It's Week 1. Focus on volume (send more messages). Review your outreach script - is it too generic? Ask team for feedback.

**Q: What if I book 10 calls but they're all bad fits?**
A: Great learning. Document why they're bad fits. This helps you refine your targeting. Use Sales Analyst to identify patterns.

**Q: What if someone wants to sign a project this week?**
A: Amazing! Post in #wins. Get Matthew to help with contract. Use standard AriseGroup contract template (get from lawyer or use online template). Make sure payment goes to AriseGroup bank account.

**Q: What if two founders want the same client?**
A: Rare, but possible. Rule: Whoever had first contact is Lead. Other founder becomes Contributor (gets paid from 40% contributor pool based on hours worked).

**Q: What if I can't commit 15 hours this week?**
A: Communicate early. Tell team in Monday meeting. Reduce your outreach target. It's better to do 5 quality calls than rush through 10 bad ones.

**Q: What if the Sales Analyst agent gives bad advice?**
A: Use your judgment. It's a tool, not a boss. If the pricing seems wrong, adjust it. Share feedback in Friday sync so we can refine the prompts.

**Q: What if a prospect asks about our client list/case studies?**
A: Be honest: "We're launching this month, so I can't share client names yet. But here's my background: [your specific credibility]." Emphasize your personal track record.

## BLOCKERS & ESCALATION

### If You're Blocked:

1. **Try to self-resolve** (15 min)
   - Check documentation
   - Google the issue
   - Ask ChatGPT/Claude

2. **Ask in Slack** (#general)
   - "Stuck on [X], need help"
   - Usually someone answers in <1 hour

3. **Tag specific founder** (if urgent)
   - Tech issue → @Matthew
   - Legal/business → @Mekaiel
   - Process/operations → @Chris
   - Industry/vertical → Tag vertical lead

4. **Call emergency meeting** (if critical)
   - Only for: Client wants to sign today, major conflict, system down
   - Post "@channel - Emergency, need 15 min call ASAP"

---

## CELEBRATION PROTOCOL

### When to Celebrate (Post in #wins):
- First discovery call booked
- First discovery call completed
- First proposal sent
- First positive response to outreach
- First project closed
- Hit weekly metrics (20 calls, 5 proposals, etc.)
- Founder helps another founder close a deal
- Someone learns something valuable

### How to Celebrate:
- Post in #wins with details
- Tag the person who won
- React with emojis
- Share the learning

**Why this matters:** Week 1 is hard. Momentum comes from celebrating small wins.
