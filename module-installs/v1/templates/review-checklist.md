# Weekly Review Checklist

> Run with `/review`. Target: 30-60 minutes. Friday recommended.

---

## Phase 1: GET CLEAR — Empty All Inboxes

- [ ] Process `gtd/inbox.md` to zero (use the decision tree)
- [ ] Check email inbox — capture anything actionable
- [ ] Check messages (Slack, WhatsApp, DMs) — capture anything actionable
- [ ] Check notes and voice memos — capture anything actionable
- [ ] Mind sweep — use trigger lists below to catch everything floating in your head

---

## Phase 2: GET CURRENT — All Lists Reflect Reality

- [ ] Review calendar (past 2 weeks) — any follow-ups missed?
- [ ] Review calendar (next 2 weeks) — any preparation needed?
- [ ] Walk through `gtd/next-actions.md` — done? still relevant? add new?
- [ ] Walk through `gtd/waiting-for.md` — follow up on overdue? move completed?
- [ ] Walk through `gtd/projects.md` — still active? status change? **stuck project test: does every project have a next action?**

---

## Phase 3: GET CREATIVE — Look Up and Out

- [ ] Scan `gtd/someday-maybe.md` — activate, delete, or add?
- [ ] Scan `gtd/areas.md` — any area neglected? missing a project?
- [ ] Open brainstorm — any big ideas from this review?

---

## Phase 4: REBUILD — Update the Dashboard

- [ ] Update `gtd/dashboard.md` with fresh counts
- [ ] Update "Last Review" date to today
- [ ] Set "Next Review" to one week from today

## GTD Decision Tree (Quick Reference)

```
Item from inbox
  |
  "Is this actionable?"
  |
  NO --> Trash / Someday-Maybe / Reference
  |
  YES --> "What's the desired outcome?"
    |
    If 2+ steps --> Add to Projects
    |
    "What's the NEXT physical action?"
    |
    <2 min? --> Do it NOW
    Someone else? --> Delegate --> Waiting-For
    Me, >2 min --> Next Actions (by context)
```

## 10 Core GTD Principles

1. Your mind is for having ideas, not holding them
2. Capture everything — don't rely on memory
3. Define "done" and "doing" for every commitment
4. The next action must be a physical, visible activity
5. A project is any outcome requiring more than one action step
6. Every project needs at least one next action (the stuck project test)
7. Review weekly to maintain trust in the system
8. Context determines what you can do now
9. Two-minute rule: if it takes <2 min, do it immediately
10. "Someday/Maybe" is not a graveyard — review it weekly
