## Brand Positioning

**Who you are:** {Your name and what you do — one sentence}

**Your authority:** {Why should anyone listen to you on this topic? What credentials, experience, results, or unique perspective do you have?}

**Brand voice:** {How do you communicate? Formal/casual, technical/accessible, provocative/measured?}

**Brand pillars:** {3-4 core values or themes that define your brand}
- {Pillar 1} — {description}
- {Pillar 2} — {description}
- {Pillar 3} — {description}

## Target Audience Segments

Define 3-5 distinct audience segments. Each segment is a specific type of person you create content for. Be specific — "everyone" is not a segment.

### Segment 1: {Name}

- **Who they are:** {Brief profile — demographics, situation, mindset}
- **What they care about:** {Their primary concerns and interests}
- **What they want:** {The outcome they dream about}
- **What they need:** {What they actually need to get there — often different from what they want}
- **Language level:** {Simple/no jargon, outcome-focused, technical, strategic}
- **Where they are in the journey:** {Beginner / intermediate / advanced}

### Segment 2: {Name}

- **Who they are:** {Brief profile}
- **What they care about:** {Primary concerns}
- **What they want:** {Desired outcome}
- **What they need:** {Actual need}
- **Language level:** {How to speak to them}
- **Where they are in the journey:** {Stage}

### Segment 3: {Name}

- **Who they are:** {Brief profile}
- **What they care about:** {Primary concerns}
- **What they want:** {Desired outcome}
- **What they need:** {Actual need}
- **Language level:** {How to speak to them}
- **Where they are in the journey:** {Stage}

{Add more segments as needed — 3-5 is the sweet spot}

## Proof Points

The specific credentials, numbers, stories, and evidence you use to build trust. Organized by audience stage — earlier audiences need bigger, more impressive numbers; later audiences need specific, relatable success stories.

| Audience Stage | Best Proof Types | Your Specific Proof Points |
|---------------|-----------------|---------------------------|
| {New / Unaware} | Big numbers, social proof | {e.g., "10K subscribers", "500+ clients served"} |
| {Interested} | Results + relatable stories | {e.g., "Helped X achieve Y in Z time"} |
| {Ready to buy} | Specific named results | {e.g., "Client A went from $0 to $5K/mo in 60 days"} |
