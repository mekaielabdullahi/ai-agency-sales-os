## What Is Packaging?

Packaging is the combination of **thumbnail** and **title** that a viewer sees before deciding whether to click. It is the digital equivalent of a book cover — the critical first impression that determines whether your content gets consumed at all.

Packaging is NOT the content itself. It is the wrapper around the content. The best video in the world gets zero views with bad packaging. Good packaging amplifies great content — but it cannot save bad content.

**The job of packaging:** Convert an impression into a click. That's it. Everything in this document serves that single objective.

## The Core Principle: Want vs. Need

This is the most important concept in packaging and must be internalized before anything else.

**The market knows what it WANTS, but not what it NEEDS.**

- If you position your video as what they NEED, the market won't resonate — they don't recognize it as important, so they won't click.
- If you position your video as what they WANT, they click — and inside the video, you deliver what they actually need.

**The master question for every piece of packaging:**

> "How can I position this idea and content as a way for someone to get what they truly want?"

### How This Works in Practice

| What You Made | What They Need (Don't Title This) | What They Want (Title This) |
|---------------|-----------------------------------|-----------------------------|
| A process for getting clients | "How to follow up on leads" | "How I Sign 3 Clients Per Week (My Exact System)" |
| Advice on improving a skill | "5 points on improving X" | "The #1 Mistake Killing Your [Skill] (And How to Fix It)" |
| A framework for understanding something | "A visualisation of [concept]" | "The [Framework Name] That Changed Everything" |
| A group Q&A session | "Group Q&A for subscribers" | "How To [Achieve Goal] — Masterclass" |

The title and thumbnail should call out something they want. The video content is what they need to get it.

## How Viewers Decide to Click

Understanding the viewer's decision process is essential. It happens in three stages, in approximately 2-3 seconds:

### Stage 1: Visual Processing (Thumbnail) — 1-2 seconds

The viewer's eye catches the thumbnail in their feed. This is purely visual and emotional:
- Is there a face? What emotion?
- Is there pattern interruption? (Does this stand out?)
- Can I instantly tell what this is about?

### Stage 2: Contextual Processing (Title) — 0.5-1 second

If the thumbnail caught their attention, they read the title:
- What specific value will I get?
- Is this relevant to me right now?
- Is there a curiosity gap I need to resolve?

### Stage 3: Decision — Instant

Based on the combined signal from thumbnail + title:
- Does this look worth my time?
- Click or scroll.

**Critical implication:** Thumbnail and title are processed at different stages and serve different functions. They must work as a **complementary system**, not as redundant elements.

---

## The Complementary System

This is the most common mistake in packaging and the single highest-leverage fix.

### Complementary Packaging (GOOD)

Thumbnail and title provide **different pieces of information** that together create a complete, compelling picture.

**Example:**
- Thumbnail: Your surprised face next to a recognizable icon/logo
- Title: "How I Made $10,000 in 30 Days with This [Tool]"
- Result: Thumbnail creates visual curiosity (what's happening?), title provides the specific promise.

### Redundant Packaging (BAD)

Thumbnail and title say the same thing.

**Example:**
- Thumbnail: Your face with text "$10,000 in 30 Days"
- Title: "How I Made $10,000 in 30 Days"
- Result: Two surfaces communicating one piece of information. Less reason to click.

### The Rule

The thumbnail provides the **visual hook and emotional trigger**. The title provides the **specific promise and contextual frame**. Together they tell a complete "story" that makes the click feel necessary.

### How to Test Complementarity

Ask: "If I covered the title, would the thumbnail alone raise a question? If I covered the thumbnail, would the title alone make a clear promise?" If both answers are yes, and the question + promise are different but related, you have complementary packaging.

## Step-by-Step Packaging Process

When packaging any video, work through these steps in order.

### Step 1: Define the Target Viewer

Before anything else, answer: **Who is this for?**

Reference your audience segments from `content/brand-and-audience.md`. The target viewer determines the title language, thumbnail emotion, level of specificity, and proof points.

### Step 2: Identify What They WANT

Using the Want vs. Need framework:
1. What is the actual content of the video? (This is the NEED)
2. What outcome does your target viewer dream about? (This is the WANT)
3. How can you frame #1 as the path to #2?

Write down 3-5 "want" framings before moving to titles.

### Step 3: Craft Title Options

Generate 3-5 title options using the viral title elements (below). Each title should:
- Lead with what the viewer WANTS
- Create a curiosity gap or make a clear value promise
- Be under 60 characters (ideally under 50 for mobile)
- Use at least 2 viral title elements in combination

### Step 4: Design the Thumbnail Concept

With the best title(s) selected, design the thumbnail to COMPLEMENT the title:
1. What visual would create curiosity that the title then resolves?
2. What emotion matches this content?
3. What 2-4 word text overlay adds information the title doesn't have?
4. What simple visual element reinforces the topic?

The thumbnail must be readable at mobile size (~168x94px).

### Step 5: Validate the Package

- [ ] **Complementary test:** Do they provide different information?
- [ ] **Scroll-stop test:** Would this make YOU stop scrolling?
- [ ] **Want test:** Does this call out something the target viewer actively wants?
- [ ] **Simplicity test:** Can someone understand the concept in under 3 seconds?
- [ ] **Mobile test:** Is the thumbnail readable small? Is the title under 60 chars?
- [ ] **Promise test:** Does the video actually deliver on what the packaging promises?
- [ ] **Broad appeal test:** Would someone outside the core audience still be intrigued?

## Thumbnail Strategy

### The Psychology

Four drivers make thumbnails click-worthy:
1. **Pattern interruption** — Stand out from surrounding content
2. **Emotional response** — Faces with clear emotions trigger empathy
3. **Curiosity gap** — Visuals that raise questions drive clicks
4. **Visual hierarchy** — Direct the eye: face → text → visual element

### The Three Elements

Every thumbnail: **2-3 elements maximum.** Simplicity wins.

#### Element 1: Face / Emotion (Almost Always Required)
- Your face showing a clear, exaggerated emotion
- Eyes must be visible
- Emotion should match the content

| Emotion | Expression | Best For |
|---------|-----------|----------|
| Shock / Surprise | Wide eyes, open mouth | Breaking news, big reveals, unexpected results |
| Confidence | Direct gaze, slight smile | Guides, proven methods, authority content |
| Urgency | Intense focus, leaning in | Time-sensitive opportunities, warnings |
| Excitement | Big smile, high energy | Wins, milestones, opportunities |
| Concern | Furrowed brow, serious | Warnings, risks, contrarian takes |
| Curiosity | Raised eyebrow, head tilt | Questions, explorations, "what if" |

#### Element 2: Text Overlay (2-4 Words)
- **Maximum 4 words.** Readable at smallest size.
- Must **complement** the title — different information
- High contrast (white/yellow on dark, or dark with glow/stroke)

#### Element 3: Visual Element (Simple)
- One supporting graphic: logo, screenshot, arrow, product, before/after
- Must be instantly recognizable
- Adds context the face and text don't provide

### Composition Rules

1. **Face on the LEFT side.** Most cultures read left-to-right. Data shows 15-20% CTR improvement with left-side face placement.
2. **Text on the right or overlaid.**
3. **Clean, uncluttered background.**
4. **Intentional visual hierarchy:** face first, text second, visual third.
5. **2-3 components maximum.**

### Color Psychology

| Color | Signals | When to Use |
|-------|---------|-------------|
| Red / Orange | Urgency, excitement | Breaking news, warnings |
| Blue | Trust, authority | Guides, tutorials, professional |
| Yellow | Optimism, attention | Opportunities, wins, results |
| Green | Money, growth | Revenue, business growth |
| Dark/Black | Premium, dramatic | Contrarian takes, deep dives |

### Thumbnail Types

1. **Face + Bold Text** (Default) — Most versatile, highest baseline CTR
2. **Screen Capture + Face** — Good for tutorials, demos, "here's what I built"
3. **Before/After or Comparison** — Good for case studies, results, "X vs Y"
4. **Money/Results Focus** — Revenue screenshots, growth charts, dollar figures
5. **Raw / Value-Forward** — Minimal design, signals "pure value, no fluff"

## Title Construction Rules

1. **Under 60 characters.** Ideally under 50. Mobile truncates at ~65.
2. **Front-load the hook.** First 3-5 words must grab. YouTube truncates from the right.
3. **Use niche buzzwords.** Every niche has power words — find and use yours.
4. **Curiosity, drama, negativity, simplicity.** These four drive clicks.
5. **Don't reveal the full answer.** Create a question the viewer must click to resolve.
6. **Numbers and dollar signs grab attention.** Specific > vague.
7. **Parenthetical kickers add context.** "(My Honest Take)", "(Full Breakdown)"

## Ethical Clickbait

1. Make a bold but **truthful** promise
2. **Deliver** on that promise completely
3. Ideally **over-deliver**

Trust compounds over time and is your most valuable asset.
