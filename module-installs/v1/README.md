# Slash Command Toolkit

> Two commands that help you figure out what to build and how to build it.

## What This Does

- **`/brainstorm`** — Scans your workspace for manual tasks and processes, ranks the best automation opportunities, and helps you decide what to build next
- **`/explore [idea]`** — Takes any idea and walks you through shaping it step by step into a clear concept ready to build
- Together they create a build cycle: brainstorm → explore → implement → repeat

## What You Need

- A computer (Mac or Linux)
- Claude Code installed
- ContextOS installed (your workspace needs a CLAUDE.md)

## How to Install

1. Give this folder to Claude Code
2. Say: "Read INSTALL.md and help me set this up"
3. Follow along — Claude handles everything

**Estimated setup time:** 5-10 minutes

## Running Cost

Free — these are pure slash commands with no API keys or external services.

## What's Inside

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `INSTALL.md` | Installation guide (Claude reads this) |
| `README.md` | This file — human overview |
| `commands/explore.md` | The /explore command |
| `commands/brainstorm.md` | The /brainstorm command |
