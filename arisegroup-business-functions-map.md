## Cross-Functional Dependencies

### Key Handoffs & Integrations

| From | To | Type | Frequency | Pain Point |
|------|----|----- |-----------|------------|
| Marketing (LinkedIn) | Sales (DMs) | Inbound leads | Daily | ⚪ Smooth (manual, low volume) |
| Sales (Discovery) | Delivery (Audit) | Client handoff | Per client | ⚪ Not yet tested |
| Sales (Outreach) | Operations (Tracking) | Data entry | Daily | 🟡 Manual spreadsheet updates |
| Content (Ideas) | Marketing (Posts) | Content pipeline | Weekly | 🟢 Working well |
| Product (Frameworks) | Delivery (Client work) | Tool usage | Per client | ⚪ Not yet validated |

**Key Insight**: Most dependencies currently smooth because scale is low (solo, part-time, pre-revenue). Pain points will emerge at scale.

---

## Priority Bottlenecks & Opportunities

### Current Bottlenecks (Week 3)

#### Bottleneck #1: Outreach Message Creation
**Category**: Time Waste
**Description**: Each personalized LinkedIn message takes 7-8 minutes (research + drafting + sending)
**Current State**: Manual research and drafting
**Root Cause**: No AI assistance, all human-written
**Impact Analysis**:
- Time Cost: 3.5-4.5 hours/week (Week 3 target: 30-40 messages)
- Financial Cost: ~$700-900/month (at $200/hr opportunity cost)
- Scalability Impact: Cannot scale beyond 40 messages/week at part-time
**Frequency**: Daily (Week 3)
**Priority**: 🟡 High (but sustainable for now at Week 3 volume)

**AI Opportunity**: AI-assisted message generation
- Input: Prospect LinkedIn profile URL
- Output: Personalized message draft
- Time: 7 min → 3 min (save 4 min per message = 2-2.5 hours/week)
- Implementation: Medium complexity (needs LinkedIn data + prompt engineering)
- Priority: Implement after Week 3 validation

---

#### Bottleneck #2: Proposal Creation (Future)
**Category**: Revenue Loss (delayed closing)
**Description**: No proposal template exists; each from scratch (estimated 4-6 hours)
**Current State**: Untested (no proposals sent yet)
**Root Cause**: Not yet built, each client custom
**Impact Analysis**:
- Time Cost: 4-6 hours per proposal
- Financial Cost: ~$800-1,200 opportunity cost per proposal
- Scalability Impact: Cannot handle multiple proposals simultaneously
**Frequency**: Per qualified lead (estimated 2-4/month starting Week 4+)
**Priority**: 🔴 Critical (build before first proposal needed)

**AI Opportunity**: AI proposal generator
- Input: Discovery call notes + audit findings
- Output: Complete proposal draft (scope, timeline, pricing, ROI)
- Time: 4-6 hours → 1 hour (editing only)
- Implementation: High complexity (needs template + data + calculations)
- Priority: Build in Week 4 (before first proposal)

---

#### Bottleneck #3: Discovery Call Follow-Up
**Category**: Customer Experience + Time Waste
**Description**: Post-call audit summary creation takes 30 minutes manually
**Current State**: Not yet tested (first calls coming Week 3+)
**Root Cause**: Manual note synthesis and summary writing
**Impact Analysis**:
- Time Cost: 30 min per call
- Customer Experience: Delay in follow-up (ideally same day)
- Scalability Impact: 2 calls/day = 1 hour just on follow-up
**Frequency**: Per discovery call (target 1-2/week now, 5-10/week eventually)
**Priority**: 🟡 High (will become critical at scale)

**AI Opportunity**: AI call note-taker + summary generator
- Input: Call recording
- Output: Structured notes + audit summary + action items
- Time: 30 min → 5 min (review/edit)
- Implementation: Medium complexity (transcription + summarization)
- Priority: Implement after first 3-5 calls (validate manual process first)

---

#### Bottleneck #4: Content Creation Time
**Category**: Time Waste
**Description**: LinkedIn post drafting takes 30-40 min per post
**Current State**: Manual drafting, 2-3 posts/week = 1.5-2 hours
**Root Cause**: Quality and authenticity matter (not purely efficiency)
**Impact Analysis**:
- Time Cost: 1.5-2 hours/week
- Marketing Impact: Less than expected (quality > quantity)
- Scalability Impact: Sustainable at current frequency
**Frequency**: 2-3x per week
**Priority**: 🟢 Low (working, not broken)

**AI Opportunity**: AI-assisted post drafting
- Input: Bullet points, raw ideas, voice notes
- Output: Polished LinkedIn post draft
- Time: 30-40 min → 10-15 min (editing)
- Implementation: Low complexity (straightforward prompt)
- Priority: ⚪ Very Low (quality and authenticity prioritized over speed)

---

### Bottleneck Prioritization Matrix

| Bottleneck | Impact (1-10) | Ease to Fix (1-10) | Priority Score | Category |
|------------|---------------|-------------------|----------------|----------|
| Proposal Creation | 10 | 6 | 8.5 | Critical (Week 4) |
| Discovery Call Follow-Up | 8 | 7 | 7.75 | High (After validation) |
| Outreach Message Creation | 7 | 7 | 7.0 | High (After Week 3) |
| Content Creation Time | 5 | 8 | 6.0 | Medium-Low |

**Priority Score Formula**: (Impact × 2 + Ease to Fix) / 3

   - **Impact**: Save 20-25 min per post = 1 hour/week
   - **Feasibility**: High (straightforward)
   - **ROI**: $200/week (but authenticity matters more)
   - **Build Order**: 5th (low priority)

6. **Audit Report Auto-Generator** (Priority 6)
   - **Impact**: Save 3-4 hours per audit
   - **Feasibility**: Medium-High (complex template)
   - **ROI**: $600-800 per audit
   - **Build Order**: 6th (after several manual audits)

---

## Expected Cumulative Impact

- **Cost Reduction**: $700-1,100 per client
- **Quality Improvement**: Faster follow-up, consistent proposals
- **Scalability**: Can handle 2-3 clients simultaneously

### After Phase 3 (Weeks 6-8 - Scale Enablers)
- **Time Saved**: +3.5 hours/week (outreach + CRM)
- **Cost Reduction**: +$600-700/week
- **Scalability**: Outreach capacity 40 → 60+ messages/week

### After Phase 4 (Month 3+ - Optimization)
- **Time Saved**: +4-5 hours/week (content + audit reports)
- **Total Weekly Savings**: 7-8.5 hours/week automated
- **Total Value**: $1,400-1,700/week = $5,600-6,800/month

## Key Insights & Strategic Recommendations

### What's Working Extremely Well
1. ✅ **Claude Code OS**: Daily planning 30 min → 1 min (3+ hours/week saved)
2. ✅ **HR Agent Factory**: Agent creation 2+ hours → 30 min (validated)
3. ✅ **Part-Time Execution Model**: Sustainable 3-4 hours/day, high-quality focus
4. ✅ **Build-in-Public Content**: Authentic, real, creating inbound interest

### Critical Gaps to Address
1. 🔴 **No proposal template**: Build before first qualified lead converts
2. 🟡 **Manual outreach bottleneck**: Sustainable now, won't scale
3. 🟡 **Discovery call follow-up**: Will become bottleneck at 5+ calls/week

### Strategic Priorities (Next 4 Weeks)
1. **Week 3**: Execute outreach manually, validate messaging, collect data
2. **Week 4**: Build proposal generator, execute first discovery calls
3. **Week 5**: Implement call note-taker, continue outreach
4. **Week 6**: Assess scale needs, build outreach assistant if volume warrants

### Don't Automate Yet
- ⚪ Content creation (authenticity > speed)
- ⚪ Engagement/comments (relationship quality matters)
