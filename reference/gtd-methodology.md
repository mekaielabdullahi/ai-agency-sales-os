## Core Philosophy

GTD is built on one fundamental insight: **your mind is for having ideas, not holding them.** The human brain is a terrible office -- it reminds you of things at the wrong time, creates anxiety by cycling through open loops, and wastes cognitive resources on unresolved commitments. GTD provides a trusted external system that frees your mind to focus on the work at hand.

### "Mind Like Water"

In karate, "mind like water" describes the state of perfect readiness. Imagine throwing a pebble into a still pond -- the water responds totally appropriately to the force and mass of the input, then returns to calm. It does not overreact or underreact. Anything that causes you to overreact or underreact controls you, and often does.

GTD's promise is to restore this state: **relaxed control** where you can dedicate 100% of your attention to whatever you choose, with confidence that nothing is falling through the cracks. This is "stress-free productivity" -- not the absence of work, but the absence of unproductive anxiety about work.

### The Problem GTD Solves

- **Open loops** -- anything pulling at your attention that does not belong where it is, the way it is. Every undecided, unclarified, unorganized commitment drains mental energy.
- **RAM overload** -- your short-term memory functions like computer RAM. It has limited capacity. When it is full of unprocessed "stuff," your higher-order thinking degrades.
- **The key insight:** Things are on your mind because (1) you have not clarified the intended outcome, (2) you have not decided the next physical action, and/or (3) you have not placed reminders in a system you trust.

### The Transformation of "Stuff"

Allen defines **"stuff"** as anything you have allowed into your psychological or physical world that does not belong where it is, for which you have not yet determined the desired outcome and the next action step. The entire GTD methodology is about transforming amorphous "stuff" into clear outcomes and concrete actions.

## The Five Steps of GTD

GTD's horizontal workflow management consists of five discrete stages. The quality of your system is only as good as the weakest link in this five-phase chain. All five must be integrated.

### 1. Capture (Collect)

**Get it out of your head and into a trusted collection tool.**

Every open loop -- anything incomplete, anything you want to change, anything pulling at your attention -- must be captured into a collection bucket outside your mind.

**Three requirements for capture to work:**

1. **Every open loop must be in your collection system and out of your head.** If some things are tracked externally and some are still floating in your mind, you will not trust the system and will not use it.
2. **You must have as few collection buckets as you can get by with.** Too many and you cannot process them consistently.
3. **You must empty them regularly.** A collection bucket you never process is just a pile. "Emptying" does not mean completing everything -- it means deciding what each item is and what to do about it.

**Collection tools:** Physical in-basket, paper notebooks, digital note-taking apps, voice recorders, email inboxes. The medium does not matter as long as you capture everything and process regularly.

### 2. Clarify (Process)

**Decide what each item means and what to do about it.**

This is the most critical thinking step. For each item in your inbox, apply the **Processing Decision Tree**:

```
"STUFF"
   |
   v
[In-basket]
   |
   v
"What is it?"
   |
   v
"Is it actionable?"
   |
   +---> NO ---> Three options:
   |              1. TRASH -- no potential value, delete/discard
   |              2. SOMEDAY/MAYBE -- not now, but maybe later (incubate)
   |              3. REFERENCE -- no action needed, but potentially useful information (file it)
   |
   +---> YES ---> Two questions:
                   1. "What project or outcome have you committed to?"
                   2. "What is the next action?"
                   |
                   If it requires MORE THAN ONE action step --> add to PROJECTS list
                   |
                   v
                   "What is the next action?"
                   (Must be a physical, visible activity)
                   |
                   v
                   "Will it take less than 2 minutes?"
                   |
                   +---> YES --> DO IT NOW (the 2-minute rule)
                   |
                   +---> NO ---> Two options:
                                  a. DELEGATE IT --> "Am I the right person?"
                                     If no --> hand it off --> track on WAITING FOR list
                                  b. DEFER IT --> you are the right person, but not now
                                     --> place on CALENDAR (if date/time specific)
                                     --> or on NEXT ACTIONS list (as soon as possible)
```

**Critical processing rules:**
- Process items one at a time, starting from the top. Do not skip around.
- Never put anything back into "in." Once you pick it up, decide about it.
- If an item requires multiple steps to complete, it is a **project** -- capture the outcome on your Projects list AND determine the next action.

### 3. Organize

**Put the results of your processing into the right buckets.**

Processing and organizing happen together -- you clarify what something is, then immediately place the reminder in the correct category. There are eight discrete categories:

**For actionable items:**
- **Projects list** -- the master index of all open loops requiring more than one action
- **Project support material** -- plans, notes, reference for active projects
- **Calendar** -- date/time-specific actions and information ONLY
- **Next Actions lists** -- organized by context
- **Waiting For list** -- delegated items and things you are expecting from others

**For non-actionable items:**
- **Trash** -- anything with no future value
- **Someday/Maybe list** -- things you might want to do but not now
- **Reference filing** -- information with no action required, retrievable when needed

Each category is detailed below in the Key Concepts section.

### 4. Reflect (Review)

**Look at your system regularly to maintain trust and make good choices.**

Without regular review, the system degrades and your mind starts holding things again. There are multiple review frequencies:

**Daily review:**
- Check your **calendar** first -- what is the "hard landscape" for today? What absolutely must happen?
- Scan your **Next Actions lists** -- what can you do given your current context, time, and energy?

**Weekly Review (the critical success factor):**
- The single most important habit in GTD. See the detailed Weekly Review section below.

**Periodic review:**
- Higher-horizon reviews (areas of responsibility, goals, vision, purpose) at appropriate intervals -- monthly, quarterly, annually.

### 5. Engage (Do)

**Choose your actions with confidence.**

At any point in time, you are making a choice about what to do. GTD does not dictate what to do -- it gives you the framework to make that choice with confidence and clarity. Three models assist:

#### The Four-Criteria Model for Choosing Actions in the Moment

When deciding what to do right now, apply these four filters in order:

1. **Context** -- What can you do where you are, with the tools you have? (This is why Next Actions are organized by context.)
2. **Time available** -- How long until your next commitment? Do not start something you cannot meaningfully advance.
3. **Energy available** -- Match the action to your current physical and mental energy level.
4. **Priority** -- Given the above constraints, what gives the highest payoff?

#### The Threefold Model for Evaluating Daily Work

At any time, you are doing one of three things:

1. **Doing predefined work** -- working from your Next Actions lists
2. **Doing work as it shows up** -- handling unplanned interruptions and opportunities (consciously choosing that these are more important than predefined work)
3. **Defining your work** -- processing inboxes, clarifying new inputs, breaking down projects

All three are legitimate. The key is being conscious about which you are doing and why.

#### The Six-Level Model for Reviewing Your Work (Horizons of Focus)

See the Horizons of Focus section below.

## Key Concepts

### Inbox (Collection Buckets)

The holding pen for all unprocessed "stuff." Everything enters here before being clarified. The inbox must be emptied regularly -- not by completing everything, but by making decisions about everything in it. Once processed, items move to the appropriate organizational bucket. Nothing stays in the inbox.

### Projects

**Definition: Any desired result that requires more than one action step.**

This is broader than most people think. "Get tires changed" is a project if it requires calling for a quote AND scheduling the appointment. "Finalize budget" is a project. "Plan vacation" is a project.

**Key principles:**
- The Projects list is simply an index of outcomes -- not a place for plans or details.
- Projects do not need to be listed in any particular order (not by priority, size, or urgency). They just need to be on a master list you review regularly.
- **You do not "do" a project. You can only do actions related to it.** When enough of the right actions have been taken, the outcome emerges and you can call the project "done."
- Every active project must have at least one next action defined. If it does not, it is stuck.
- The Projects list is your "list of open loops" -- a compilation of finish lines you put before yourself to keep next actions moving on all tracks.

**Common mistake:** Confusing projects with next actions. "Set up new computer" is a project. "Research Mac vs PC options online" is a next action. Most to-do lists are an "amorphous blob of undoability" because they mix these levels. The solution is to separate the outcome (project) from the very next physical action.

### Next Actions

**Definition: The next physical, visible activity that needs to happen to move something forward.**

This is the most critical concept in GTD. A "next action" must be a concrete, physical behavior -- not a vague intention.

**Bad examples (too vague):**
- "Handle insurance"
- "Set up meeting"
- "Do budget"

**Good examples (concrete, physical):**
- "Call Allstate for auto insurance quote -- 555-0123"
- "Email Sarah to propose 3pm Thursday for project kickoff"
- "Draft initial budget line items in spreadsheet"

**Organization by context:** When you have 50-150 next actions (which is typical), organize them by the context required to do them:

- **@me** -- actions only you can do (decisions, approvals, personal tasks)
- **@claude** -- work to do in Claude Code sessions (analysis, writing, planning, automation)
- **@calls** -- phone or video calls to make
- **@team** -- items requiring team coordination (specify who)
- **@errands** -- things to do while out
- **@think** -- creative thinking, brainstorming, reflection
- **@record** -- things to capture, document, write up

Contexts are determined by what tools, location, or people you need. When you are at a phone, you pull up your @calls list. When you are in a Claude Code session, you pull up your @claude list. This eliminates the friction of scanning through actions you cannot do right now.

### Waiting For

A list tracking everything you have delegated or are expecting from others. Each item should be dated (when you made the request or when you expect it). Review this list weekly and follow up as needed.

**Examples:**
- "WF: John -- revised proposal (requested 2/14)"
- "WF: Amazon -- order #12345 arriving by 2/20"
- "WF: Accountant -- Q4 tax estimates"

### Someday/Maybe

The "parking lot" for things you might want to do at some point but are not committed to now. This list prevents these ideas from cluttering your active system while ensuring they are not forgotten.

**Typical items:** Learn Spanish, build a wine cellar, take a trip to Northern Italy, write a book, explore a new business idea.

**Critical:** Review this list during your Weekly Review. Items may become active projects when circumstances change. Items that no longer interest you get deleted.

### Reference

Information with no action required but potential future value. Must be stored in a way that makes retrieval easy. Two forms:
1. **Topic/area-specific storage** -- organized by subject matter
2. **General-reference filing** -- for ad hoc information that does not fit a pre-defined category

A good reference system must be easy to file into and easy to retrieve from. If filing is painful, you will stack instead of file, and the line between actionable and non-actionable will blur.

### Calendar

The calendar is **sacred territory.** Only three things go on it:

1. **Time-specific actions** -- appointments, meetings (things happening at a specific time)
2. **Day-specific actions** -- things that must be done on a specific day but not at a specific time
3. **Day-specific information** -- information you want to know on a certain date (directions, context for a meeting, reminders)

**Nothing else goes on the calendar.** No daily to-do lists. No "hope-to-do" items. If it is on the calendar, it must get done that day or it is a broken agreement. This discipline keeps the calendar trustworthy -- when you look at it, you see only the "hard landscape" of non-negotiable commitments.

All other actions go on Next Actions lists, where they can be renegotiated moment to moment based on context, time, energy, and priority.

### Tickler File

A date-based reminder system (physical: 43 folders for 31 days + 12 months; digital: calendar reminders). Allows you to "mail something to yourself" for receipt on a future date. Used for items that need no action now but will need attention on a specific future date.

## The Processing Decision Tree (Complete Reference)

This is the core algorithm of GTD. For every item that enters your inbox:

```
1. Pick up the item (one at a time, starting from the top)

2. "What is it?" -- Identify what the item actually is

3. "Is it actionable?" -- Does this require action from you?

   IF NO:
   +-- Is it trash? --> DELETE / DISCARD
   +-- Might it be useful someday? --> SOMEDAY/MAYBE list
   +-- Is it reference information? --> FILE in reference system

   IF YES:
   4. "What is the desired outcome?" (What does "done" look like?)
      --> If it requires 2+ action steps, add the outcome to your PROJECTS list

   5. "What is the NEXT ACTION?" (The very next physical, visible step)

   6. "Will the next action take less than 2 minutes?"

      IF YES (2-Minute Rule):
      --> DO IT RIGHT NOW. The overhead of tracking it exceeds the effort of doing it.

      IF NO:
      7. "Am I the right person to do this?"

         IF NO:
         --> DELEGATE IT to the appropriate person
         --> Track on your WAITING FOR list (with date)

         IF YES:
         --> DEFER IT
         --> Place on CALENDAR (if it must happen on a specific day/time)
         --> Or place on NEXT ACTIONS list in the appropriate context
```

**The 2-Minute Rule** is not about the importance of the action. Any action that can be completed in under two minutes should be done immediately when you first identify it during processing, because the time it takes to organize and review it later would exceed the time to just do it now. This applies only during the processing/clarifying phase -- not as a general rule while doing predefined work.

## The Weekly Review

The Weekly Review is GTD's master key. It is the one habit that keeps the entire system functional. Without it, lists go stale, trust erodes, and your mind takes back the job of remembering.

### Purpose

Get clear, get current, get creative. The Weekly Review gives you the chance to:
- Gather and process all "stuff" that has accumulated
- Review your entire system for completeness
- Update all lists
- Feel confident that your system reflects reality

### The Weekly Review Process

**1. Get Clear (Empty all inboxes)**
- Collect all loose papers and materials into your in-basket
- Process all notes, journal entries, and meeting notes
- Empty all email inboxes to zero (processed, not necessarily responded to)
- Empty your head -- write down any new open loops on your mind

**2. Get Current (Review all active lists)**
- Review your **Calendar** (past 2 weeks and upcoming 2-3 weeks)
  - Past: capture any follow-ups, actions triggered, or items not yet handled
  - Future: identify preparation needed, actions to take, things to communicate
- Review your **Next Actions** lists -- mark off completed items, add new ones, ensure each is still relevant
- Review your **Waiting For** list -- follow up on outstanding items, add new ones
- Review your **Projects** list -- ensure every project has at least one next action, assess status, identify any that are complete or should be dropped
- Review any **Project Plans** and support material -- trigger any new actions

**3. Get Creative (Think bigger)**
- Review your **Someday/Maybe** list -- move items to active projects if appropriate, delete items that no longer interest you, add new ones
- Review your **Areas of Responsibility** -- scan for any new projects or actions triggered
- Think through any bold, creative, or strategic ideas that come to mind -- capture them

### When to Do It

Allen recommends weekly, ideally at the end of the work week (Friday afternoon is common). The feeling most people have the week before vacation -- clean, clear, in control -- is what the Weekly Review creates on a weekly basis.

## The Natural Planning Model

The Natural Planning Model describes how your brain naturally plans any undertaking, from going out to dinner to launching a new product. GTD leverages this natural process consciously to get projects unstuck and moving.

### The Five Phases

#### 1. Purpose and Principles
**"Why are we doing this?"**

Purpose defines success and provides the primary criterion for all decisions about the project. Principles define the boundaries -- the standards and values that constrain how the work gets done.

**Benefits of clarifying purpose:**
- Defines success
- Creates decision-making criteria
- Aligns resources
- Motivates
- Clarifies focus
- Expands options

**Principles test:** "I would give others totally free rein to do this as long as they ______." What fills the blank reveals your principles.

#### 2. Vision / Outcome
**"What does wild success look like?"**

Create a clear picture of what the project looks like when successfully completed. This is the "what" to purpose's "why." Vision activates your brain's reticular activating system -- the filter that makes you notice relevant information.

**Steps for developing a vision:**
1. View the project from beyond the completion date
2. Envision "WILD SUCCESS" (suspend "Yeah, but...")
3. Capture features, aspects, and qualities you imagine in place

#### 3. Brainstorming
**"How do we get there? What do we need to consider?"**

Once you have a vision that differs from your current reality, your brain naturally starts filling in the gaps. Capture all ideas -- do not evaluate yet.

**Brainstorming keys:**
- Do not judge, challenge, evaluate, or criticize
- Go for quantity, not quality
- Put analysis and organization in the background

**Tools:** Mind-mapping, free-form lists, whiteboards, sticky notes. The key is externalizing ideas so they generate new ideas through "distributed cognition."

#### 4. Organizing
**"What are the components, sequences, and priorities?"**

Once you have brainstormed sufficient ideas, natural structure emerges. Identify:
- **Components** -- major pieces of the project
- **Sequences** -- what must happen in what order
- **Priorities** -- what matters most

This is what people typically mean by "project planning" -- creating outlines, identifying milestones, building timelines.

#### 5. Next Actions
**"What is the very next physical step on each front?"**

The final phase brings planning back to reality. For each component of the project that can be moved forward:
- Determine the next action
- Assign responsibility (if not yours, it goes on Waiting For)
- Enter into your system

**A project is sufficiently planned when every next-action step has been decided on every front that can actually be moved on without waiting for some other component's completion.**

### The Unnatural / Reactive Planning Model

Most organizations plan reactively (the reverse of natural planning):
1. Crisis hits --> **Action!** (Throw people at the problem)
2. That does not work --> **Organize!** (Draw boxes, create structure)
3. That does not work --> **Brainstorm!** ("Who has a good idea?")
4. That does not work --> **Vision** ("What are we really trying to do?")
5. That does not work --> **Purpose** ("Why are we doing this at all?")

The reactive model always arrives at the natural model's starting point -- it just does so expensively and painfully. The question is not whether natural planning happens, but when and at what cost.

### How Much Planning?

- **80% of projects** need only a defined outcome and a next action to get off your mind
- **15% of projects** benefit from some external brainstorming (a mind-map or outline)
- **5% of projects** need the full deliberate application of the Natural Planning Model

**The test:** If the project is still on your mind after defining the outcome and next action, there is more planning to do. Work up the model: need more clarity? Brainstorm. Brainstorming stuck? Revisit the vision. Vision unclear? Return to purpose.

## Horizons of Focus

GTD uses an altitude metaphor to describe the six levels of commitment and perspective that define your "work." Priorities ultimately derive from reviewing all of these horizons.

### Runway: Current Actions
The accumulated list of all next actions you need to take -- phone calls, emails, errands, tasks. A typical person has 300-500 hours of these if they stopped receiving any new input. This is the ground level of "getting things done."

### 10,000 Feet: Current Projects
The 30-100 outcomes you are committed to completing in the relatively short term. Projects generate most of the actions on your runway. Reviewing this list weekly ensures every project has at least one next action and nothing has stalled.

### 20,000 Feet: Areas of Responsibility
The 10-15 key areas of your life and work where you want to maintain quality and standards. Professional examples: strategic planning, staff development, customer service, asset management. Personal examples: health, family, finances, home environment, recreation, personal development. Projects often emerge from areas of responsibility -- reviewing them surfaces commitments you may have missed.

### 30,000 Feet: One- to Two-Year Goals
What you want to be experiencing in the various areas of your life and work one to two years from now. These goals add another dimension to your work, potentially shifting emphasis among areas of responsibility and spawning new projects.

### 40,000 Feet: Three- to Five-Year Vision
Longer-term strategic thinking: organizational strategies, career trajectory, major life changes, environmental trends, technology shifts. Decisions at this level can reshape what your work looks like across all lower horizons.

### 50,000+ Feet: Life Purpose
The "big picture" -- why does your company exist? Why do you exist? This is the ultimate job description, the core definition of what your "work" really is. All goals, visions, objectives, projects, and actions derive from and lead toward this.

### Bottom-Up Approach

While intellectually it seems logical to work top-down (purpose first, then vision, then goals, down to actions), in practice most people are so embroiled in day-to-day commitments that they cannot focus on higher horizons. GTD recommends a **bottom-up approach**: clear the runway first, then ascend. When the daily grind is under control, creative energy naturally flows toward bigger thinking.

## Common Mistakes and Misconceptions

### Confusing Projects with Actions
The number one mistake. "Set up new accounting system" on a to-do list is a project masquerading as an action. No wonder it never gets done -- you cannot "do" a project. You can only do actions related to it. Always ask: "What is the NEXT physical action?"

### Using the Calendar as a To-Do List
The calendar is only for time/day-specific commitments. Putting "hope to do" items on the calendar dilutes its trustworthiness, causes your brain to start ignoring it, and creates daily demoralization when items get moved to the next day.

### Not Capturing Everything
If your system only holds 80% of your open loops, your mind cannot trust it and will keep trying to track the other 20% -- which means it will try to track everything. The system must be 100% complete or your mind will not let go.

### Organizing Without Processing
Many people try to "get organized" by sorting and arranging their stuff into neat categories. But if you have not made the front-end decision about what each item means and what the next action is, you are just rearranging unclear piles into slightly neater unclear piles.

### Skipping the Weekly Review
Without regular reviews, lists go stale, trust breaks down, and the system collapses. The Weekly Review is the single most important habit in GTD. It is what keeps the difference between a functioning system and a pile of old lists.

### Vague Next Actions
"Call bank" is vague. "Call Wells Fargo (555-0199) to dispute $47 charge from 2/12" is a real next action. The more specific the action, the less resistance you will feel doing it.

## Summary: The GTD System at a Glance

```
CAPTURE everything that has your attention into trusted collection tools
    |
    v
CLARIFY each item: What is it? Is it actionable? What is the next action?
    |
    v
ORGANIZE the results into the correct buckets:
    - Projects list (outcomes requiring 2+ actions)
    - Next Actions lists (by context)
    - Waiting For list (delegated / expected)
    - Calendar (date/time-specific only)
    - Someday/Maybe list (incubating)
    - Reference filing (non-actionable information)
    - Trash (no value)
    |
    v
REFLECT regularly:
    - Daily: calendar + next actions
    - Weekly: full Weekly Review (clear, current, creative)
    - Periodically: higher horizons (areas, goals, vision, purpose)
    |
    v
ENGAGE with confidence:
    - Choose actions based on context, time, energy, priority
    - Trust that you are working on the right thing
    - Maintain "mind like water"
```

**The result:** A complete, current, trusted external system that frees your mind from the burden of remembering and deciding, allowing you to be fully present and maximally effective in whatever you choose to do.

### 10 Core Principles (Quick Reference)

1. Your mind is for having ideas, not holding them
2. Capture everything — don't rely on memory
3. Define "done" and "doing" for every commitment
4. The next action must be a physical, visible activity
5. A project is any outcome requiring more than one action step
6. Every project needs at least one next action (the stuck project test)
7. Review weekly to maintain trust in the system
8. Context determines what you can do now
9. Two-minute rule: if it takes <2 min, do it immediately
10. "Someday/Maybe" is not a graveyard — review it weekly
