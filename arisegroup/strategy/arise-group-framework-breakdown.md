# Arise Group AI Outreach Framework Breakdown

## 🎯 Framework Philosophy

**Core Principle**: You don't close leads by pitching solutions. You close leads by uncovering problems, quantifying pain, and letting prospects sell themselves.

**The Method**: 5 strategic questions (in order) that give you everything you need to close.

---

## The 5 Questions

### **Q1: What is the biggest problem in your business right now?**

**Purpose**: Problem Discovery
**What you're learning**:
- Is there a real problem you can solve?
- Do they recognize it?
- How do they describe it? (Use their exact words later!)

**Why it matters**: Qualifies the lead and builds rapport through curiosity.

**Common mistake**: They tell you the problem → You immediately pitch ❌
**Correct approach**: They tell you the problem → You validate, dig deeper, move to Q2 ✅

---

### **Q2: How much is this problem costing the business per month?**

**Purpose**: Cost Quantification & Pricing Anchor
**What you're learning**:
- What's the budget ceiling?
- How urgent is this? (Higher cost = more urgent)
- Do they understand the real cost?

**Why it matters**: **THIS IS YOUR PRICING FORMULA**
- If they say "$50K/month problem" → You charge $15K-25K/month (30-50% of Q2)
- If they say "$10K/month problem" → You charge $3K-5K/month

**If they say "I don't know":**
Help them calculate:
- "How many hours per week does your team spend on this?"
- "What's that in salaries?"
- "Any lost revenue or missed opportunities?"
- "Ballpark—is this a $1K problem? $10K? $50K?"

**Critical rule**: Don't move forward without a number. You can't price what you can't quantify.

---

### **Q3: How long have you had this problem for?**

**Purpose**: Timeline Assessment & Urgency
**What you're learning**:
- Is this new (low urgency) or chronic (high urgency)?
- Have they tried to fix it? What failed?
- How much have they already lost? (Q2 × months = total pain)

**Advanced tactic - Cost Amplification**:
If they say "2 years" and Q2 was $10K/month:
→ "So this has cost you $240K so far?"
(Makes the pain massive and concrete)

**Why it matters**: The longer they've had the problem, the more desperate they are for a solution.

---

### **Q4: If you do nothing, what does the next 6 to 12 months look like?**

**Purpose**: Consequence Amplification & Urgency Creation
**What you're learning**:
- Do they understand the stakes?
- Is there a consequence to waiting?
- What's their fear? (Use this in your close)

**Why it matters**: People buy to avoid pain more than to gain pleasure. Q4 paints the picture of pain if they don't act.

**The Consequence Ladder** (if their answer is weak):
- Them: "Things will stay the same."
- You: "And if that happens, then what?"
- Them: "We'll keep wasting time..."
- You: "And if that continues for 12 months, then what?"
- Them: "We'll fall behind competitors. Could affect funding."
- **Now you have real stakes.**

**This is where you create urgency without being pushy.**

---

### **Q5: If I had a magic wand and could build the perfect solution to fix this problem, what would that look like?**

**Purpose**: Solution Design & Proposal Blueprint
**What you're learning**:
- What do THEY actually want? (Not what you want to sell)
- What does success look like to them?
- What features/outcomes matter most?

**CRITICAL RULE**: Your proposal should use their EXACT words from Q5.
- They describe it → You build it (or show how you already have it)

**Example**:
- Q5 answer: "I wish we had an AI system that pre-qualifies leads before they hit sales."
- Your proposal: "We've built an AI system that pre-qualifies leads before they hit your sales team..."
- **Use their language, not yours.**

**Why it matters**: By using their words from Q5, your proposal feels like you read their mind.

## 🔄 How They Work Together

**The Flow**:
```
Q1: Uncover the problem
  ↓
Q2: Quantify the cost (this = your pricing anchor)
  ↓
Q3: Assess urgency (how long they've suffered)
  ↓
Q4: Amplify consequence (create urgency to act NOW)
  ↓
Q5: Let them design the solution (your proposal blueprint)
  ↓
PITCH: Use their Q1-Q5 answers to build the perfect proposal
```

**By Q5, you know**:
- ✅ The problem (Q1)
- ✅ What they'll pay (Q2)
- ✅ How urgent it is (Q3)
- ✅ Why they must act now (Q4)
- ✅ Exactly what to build/propose (Q5)

**You're not pitching—you're prescribing based on their diagnosis.**

---

## 💰 The Pricing Formula

**SIMPLE MATH**:

Q2 Answer (Monthly Cost) × 0.3 to 0.5 = Your Price

**Examples**:
- Q2: $50K/month problem → Charge $15K-25K/month → Net savings: $25K-35K/month
- Q2: $20K/month problem → Charge $6K-10K/month → Net savings: $10K-14K/month
- Q2: $5K/month problem → Charge $1.5K-2.5K/month → Net savings: $2.5K-3.5K/month

**Why this works**: They're already losing the money. You're offering to save them 50-70% of it. ROI is built-in and obvious.

## 🎯 The 3 Golden Rules

### **RULE #1: Questions Flow in Order**
Never skip ahead. Each builds on the previous.
- Q1 without Q2 = no pricing context
- Q2 without Q4 = no urgency
- Q5 without Q1-Q4 = solution without problem

### **RULE #2: Listen More Than You Talk**
Your job in Q1-Q5 is to EXTRACT information, not provide it.
- Ask the question → Shut up → Listen → Clarify → Move on
- Resist the urge to pitch until all 5 are answered

### **RULE #3: Their Answers ARE Your Proposal**
Copy/paste their language into your pitch.
- Use their Q1 problem description (verbatim)
- Anchor price to their Q2 cost
- Reference their Q3 timeline to show pain duration
- Use their Q4 consequence to create urgency
- Build your solution from their Q5 vision

## 📧 Quick Application Examples

### **Email Sequence**:
- **Email 1**: Q1 only → "What's the biggest problem in your [business area] right now?"
- **Email 2**: Q2 & Q3 → "How much does this cost per month? How long has it been an issue?"
- **Email 3**: Q4 & Q5 → "What happens if you do nothing? What's the perfect solution?"
- **Email 4**: Proposal → Built entirely from their Q1-Q5 answers

### **Phone Call Flow**:
1. Opening: Ask Q1
2. Listen, validate
3. Flow through Q2, Q3, Q4, Q5 naturally
4. Transition: "Based on what you just told me, here's what I'd propose..."
5. Pitch using their exact language
6. Close with ROI math from Q2

## 🎯 Real Example in Action

**Q1**: "What's the biggest problem?"
**Answer**: "Sales team drowning in unqualified leads."

**Q2**: "How much does this cost per month?"
**Answer**: "$45K/month in wasted time and lead gen spend."

**Q3**: "How long have you had this?"
**Answer**: "8 months."

**Q4**: "What happens if you do nothing?"
**Answer**: "We'll miss growth targets or have to hire more people."

**Q5**: "Magic wand solution?"
**Answer**: "AI system that pre-qualifies leads before they hit sales."

### **Your Pitch** (Using their answers):
"Based on what you told me:
- You're losing **$45K/month** on unqualified leads [Q2]
- This has been going on **8 months** [Q3]
- If nothing changes, you'll **miss growth targets** [Q4]
- What you need is an **AI system that pre-qualifies leads** [Q5]

We built exactly that.

**Investment**: $15K/month
**Savings**: $30K/month (net)
**Timeline**: Live in 2 weeks

Make sense?"

**Close rate on this approach**: 30%+

## 🚀 Why This Framework Works

✅ **No price resistance** → Price is anchored to their stated problem cost (Q2)
✅ **No "I'll think about it"** → Q4 created urgency around consequence
✅ **Perfect product-market fit** → You built what they asked for in Q5
✅ **Fast sales cycle** → They've already sold themselves by Q5
✅ **Premium pricing** → Value-based, not cost-based

**The secret**: You're not pitching what you have. You're prescribing what they need.
