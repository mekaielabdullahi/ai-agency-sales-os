## OVERVIEW & PHILOSOPHY

### The AriseGroup Sales Approach

**We are NOT a typical sales organization.**

**What we ARE:**
- Strategic advisors who happen to build AI solutions
- Industry experts with deep vertical knowledge
- CPOs (Chief Product Officers), not order-takers
- Long-term partners, not transactional vendors

**What we ARE NOT:**
- Generic AI agency pitching the same thing to everyone
- High-pressure closers
- Build-whatever-client-asks developers
- One-and-done project shops

### Core Principles

1. **Consultative, Not Transactional**
   - We ask more than we tell
   - We prescribe solutions, clients don't dictate them
   - We position prerequisites as value, not obstacles

2. **Vertical Expertise Over Generic Pitch**
   - Each founder owns their vertical
   - Industry-specific language and credibility
   - Understanding pain points other agencies miss

3. **Prerequisites First, AI Second**
   - 80% of work is traditional software/infrastructure
   - 20% is actual Gen AI
   - We frame this as "building the foundation for AI to work"

4. **Recurring Revenue Focus**
   - Every project should lead to retainer
   - Engineering-as-a-Service is the goal
   - One-time projects are starting point, not end goal

5. **Multi-Path Monetization**
   - Tier 1: Mercenary (cash-for-service)
   - Tier 2: Partnership (2-and-20 performance model)
   - Tier 3: Missionary (co-ownership/equity)

### Success Metrics

**Not just revenue - but sustainable revenue:**
- Monthly Recurring Revenue (MRR)
- Retainer attachment rate (target: 70%+)
- Client retention (target: 80%+ at 12 months)
- Average deal size growth
- Referral rate

## THE 5 QUESTIONS FRAMEWORK

### The Foundation of Every Sale

The 5 Questions Framework is our discovery engine. **Every sales conversation uses this structure.**

### Q1: What do you do (in specific terms)?

**Purpose:** Understand their core business operation

**How to ask:**
- "Walk me through what you actually do day-to-day."
- "What does your team spend most of their time on?"
- "What's the core operation that drives your business?"

**What you're listening for:**
- Industry/vertical (validate fit)
- Operational complexity
- Team size and structure
- Core processes that could be automated

**Example Good Answer:**
"We're a defense contractor managing equipment maintenance schedules for 15 military bases. My team of 8 coordinators spends all day calling bases, tracking maintenance windows in spreadsheets, and coordinating with contractors."

**Example Bad Answer:**
"We do consulting." (Too vague - drill deeper)

### Q2: What does this cost you every month (in wasted time, lost revenue, or manual effort)?

**Purpose:** Quantify the pain in dollars and hours

**How to ask:**
- "How much time does your team waste on [problem from Q1] every month?"
- "If you had to put a dollar figure on this inefficiency, what would it be?"
- "What's this costing you in lost revenue or wasted salaries?"

**What you're listening for:**
- Monthly cost (this drives pricing)
- Quantifiable metrics (hours, dollars, headcount)
- Urgency (is this a $5K/month pain or $50K/month pain?)

**Pricing Formula:**
Your project fee = 30-50% of their Q2 monthly cost

**Example Good Answer:**
"We waste about $40K/month in coordinator salaries doing manual work, plus we miss maintenance windows which costs us $100K/year in emergency repairs. So roughly $48K/month total."

**Example Bad Answer:**
"It's frustrating but I'm not sure the exact cost." (Help them quantify - give examples)

### Q3: What have you tried before to fix this?

**Purpose:** Understand what didn't work and why

**How to ask:**
- "What have you tried to solve this problem?"
- "Have you looked at any tools or hired people to fix this?"
- "What solutions did you explore?"

**What you're listening for:**
- Prior vendors (why did they fail?)
- Budget allocated (shows willingness to pay)
- Internal attempts (hiring, process changes)
- What specifically didn't work

**This tells you:**
- Their sophistication level
- Budget history
- What NOT to propose
- Objections you'll face

**Example Good Answer:**
"We tried Salesforce but it doesn't integrate with the military's GCSS system. Also hired 2 more coordinators but that just added overhead."

### Q4: Why didn't those solutions work?

**Purpose:** Identify the REAL root cause

**How to ask:**
- "Why do you think [Q3 solution] didn't solve the problem?"
- "What was missing from [previous vendor's] approach?"
- "What would have needed to be different for that to work?"

**What you're listening for:**
- Integration challenges
- Change management failures
- Technical limitations
- Wrong scope/approach

**This is CRITICAL:**
- This tells you what prerequisites they need
- This is where you differentiate from competitors
- This is how you position your solution

**Example Good Answer:**
"Salesforce didn't work because our data is in 3 different systems that can't talk to each other. We needed integration first, but the vendor just tried to replace everything with Salesforce."

**Your positioning:**
"That's exactly what we'd do differently. Before building the AI layer, we'd integrate those 3 systems first - that's the prerequisite. Otherwise we're building on sand."

### Q5: If you had a magic wand, what would the perfect solution look like?

**Purpose:** Understand their vision (but YOU will prescribe the actual solution)

**How to ask:**
- "Imagine I wave a magic wand and this problem disappears. What does your operation look like?"
- "What would the ideal workflow be?"
- "If technology wasn't a constraint, what would you want?"

**What you're listening for:**
- Their end goal (outcome, not features)
- Unrealistic expectations (you'll temper these)
- What success looks like
- Expansion opportunities (other departments wanting same thing)

**IMPORTANT:**
- Don't just build what they describe
- Use this as input for YOUR recommendation
- Add the prerequisites they're missing
- Position yourself as CPO (strategic partner)

**Example Good Answer:**
"Magic wand solution: AI that automatically pulls data from all 3 systems, identifies upcoming maintenance windows, coordinates with contractors, and sends automated notifications. Basically an AI operations coordinator that works 24/7."

**Your Response (CPO Positioning):**
"I love that vision. Here's how we'd actually build that:

Phase 1 (Prerequisites - Month 1-2):
- Integrate your 3 systems (GCSS, spreadsheets, contractor databases)
- Build centralized data layer
- Document current coordination workflows

Phase 2 (AI Layer - Month 2-3):
- AI coordinator on top of integrated systems
- Automated notifications
- Predictive maintenance window identification

Why this order: If we build AI first without the foundation, it'll fail like your previous attempts. We need the data infrastructure first."

4. **Proposal** - Create custom proposal with prerequisites + AI
5. **Closing** - Negotiate, answer objections, sign contract
6. **Onboarding** - Hand off to delivery, set expectations

**Plus ongoing:**
7. **Retainer Conversion** - Convert project clients to recurring revenue

### Pipeline Velocity Targets

### Proposal Structure

```
ARISEGROUP [VERTICAL] PROPOSAL
AI Transformation for [Company Name]

Prepared by: [Your Name]
Date: [Date]
Vertical: [Defense/Industrial/E-commerce/Construction]

---

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

[Company] is currently facing [Q1-Q2 problem summary]. You've tried [Q3 solutions] which didn't work because [Q4 root cause].

We recommend a phased approach that builds the foundation first, then adds AI on top. This ensures the AI actually works (unlike previous attempts).

---

YOUR CURRENT CHALLENGE

[Detailed Q1-Q2 pain point description]

Cost of status quo: $[Q2 monthly cost]/month = $[annual cost]/year

---

WHY PREVIOUS SOLUTIONS FAILED

[Q4 analysis - root cause]

The pattern we see: vendors try to add AI without fixing the underlying data/integration/process issues. This is building on sand.

---

OUR RECOMMENDED APPROACH

We take a different approach: Prerequisites first, AI second.

PHASE 1: PREREQUISITES (Month 1-2)

What needs to exist before AI will work:

1. [Prerequisite 1 - e.g., System Integration]
   - What: [Description]
   - Why: [Business value]
   - Deliverable: [Specific output]
   - Timeline: [X weeks]
   - Investment: $[X,XXX]

2. [Prerequisite 2 - e.g., Data Infrastructure]
   - What: [Description]
   - Why: [Business value]
   - Deliverable: [Specific output]
   - Timeline: [X weeks]
   - Investment: $[X,XXX]

3. [Prerequisite 3]
   - [Same structure]

PHASE 1 SUBTOTAL: $[XX,XXX] | [X weeks]

---

PHASE 2: AI IMPLEMENTATION (Month 2-3)

Once the foundation is built, we add the AI layer:

[Q5 magic wand solution description]

Technical Approach:
- [Specific AI technology]
- [Integration points]
- [User interface]
- [Training and adoption]

Deliverables:
- [Specific deliverable 1]
- [Specific deliverable 2]
- [Specific deliverable 3]

PHASE 2 SUBTOTAL: $[XX,XXX] | [X weeks]

---

EXPECTED OUTCOMES

Quantified Impact:
- Time savings: [X hours/week] = $[X,XXX/month] in productivity
- Cost reduction: [Specific area] by [X%]
- Revenue increase: [If applicable]
- Error reduction: [If applicable]

ROI: $[Q2 monthly cost] problem → $[Total project cost] solution
Payback period: [X months]

---

INVESTMENT

Phase 1 (Prerequisites): $[XX,XXX]
Phase 2 (AI Implementation): $[XX,XXX]

TOTAL PROJECT INVESTMENT: $[XX,XXX]

Payment Terms:
- 50% upfront (upon contract signing)
- 25% at Phase 1 completion
- 25% at Phase 2 completion

---

TIMELINE

Week 1-2: Kickoff, discovery, planning
Week 3-6: Phase 1 prerequisites build
Week 7-8: Phase 1 testing and handoff
Week 9-12: Phase 2 AI implementation
Week 13-14: Phase 2 testing and training

TOTAL TIMELINE: [X weeks] from contract signing to full deployment

---

ONGOING SUPPORT (OPTIONAL)

We recommend keeping us on retainer for ongoing optimization and support:

TIER 1: Maintenance & Support - $[X,XXX]/month
- Bug fixes and updates
- User support
- Training refreshers

TIER 2: Engineering-as-a-Service - $[XX,XXX]/month
- Everything in Tier 1

"I spent 9 years securing Pentagon networks, NATO operations, and 15 U.S. embassies. Active Secret Clearance. I know DoD/DoS compliance and zero-failure standards. We're not a generic AI agency - we're defense infrastructure experts who happen to build AI."

[4.0 Hero - Industrial]:
"22 years in industrial automation. I've built production systems across every industry. I know what works on plant floors, not just in PowerPoints. We're not consultants theorizing - we're engineers who've done this work."

[Matthew - E-commerce]:
"6 years at Amazon as Software Engineer (Alexa team), plus I own InfinityVault e-commerce business. I understand both the tech side and the operator side. We're not developers who've never run a business - we live this every day."

## STAGE 5: CLOSING & NEGOTIATION

### Goal
Get signed contract and 50% deposit

### Follow-Up Sequence

**Day 3: Check-In**
```
Subject: Re: AI Transformation Proposal for [Company]

Hi [Name],

Just following up on the proposal I sent Tuesday.

Did you get a chance to review it? Any initial questions?

Happy to jump on a call to walk through anything.

[Your Name]
```

**Day 7: Value Reframe**
```
Subject: Re: AI Transformation Proposal for [Company]

[Name],

Following up one more time on the proposal.

I know these decisions take time. If it's helpful, here's a quick way to think about it:

Current cost: $[Q2/month] every month this continues
Investment: $[Total] one-time to fix it
Payback: [X months]

After that, it's pure savings.

When can we discuss?

[Your Name]
```

**Day 14: Final Attempt**
```
Subject: Last follow-up - [Company] AI transformation

[Name],

Last follow-up, I promise.

I know you're busy, but I want to make sure this doesn't fall through the cracks if it's actually a priority.

Three options:

1. Let's move forward → Reply "yes" and I'll send contract
2. Not right now → Reply "not now" and I'll check back in 3 months
3. Not a fit → Reply "not a fit" and I'll stop bothering you

What's your preference?

[Your Name]
```

### Common Objections & Responses

**Objection 1: "The price is too high"**

**Response:**
```
I understand. Let's look at the math together.

You're currently spending $[Q2]/month on this problem.
That's $[Q2 x 12]/year.

Our solution costs $[Total] one-time.

Payback period: [X months].
After that, you save $[Q2]/month forever.

Year 1: Spend $[Total], save $[Q2 x remaining months] = Net $[X]
Year 2: Save $[Q2 x 12] = $[X]
Year 3+: Keep saving.

The real question isn't "Is this expensive?" but "Can we afford NOT to fix this?"

What part of the pricing feels off to you?
```

**Objection 2: "We need to think about it"**

**Response:**
```
Totally fair. These are big decisions.

To help you think it through, what specific questions or concerns do you have?

Is it:
- Budget/timing?
- Technical approach?
- Our team's qualifications?
- ROI confidence?

Let's address those specifically. That'll give you a clearer decision framework.
```

**Objection 3: "Can you do it cheaper?"**

**Response:**
```
I can't reduce the price without reducing scope.

Here's what we could do:

Option 1: Phase 1 only ($[Phase 1 cost])
- Build the prerequisites
- You see immediate value from integration/infrastructure
- Pause before Phase 2 if needed

Option 2: Longer payment terms
- Same total price
- Extended payment schedule (6 months instead of 3)
- Makes cash flow easier

Option 3: Performance-based pricing
- Lower upfront cost
- We take percentage of savings for 12 months
- Shared risk/reward

Which approach makes the most sense for you?
```

**Objection 4: "We're talking to other vendors"**

**Response:**
```
Smart - you should get multiple perspectives.

When you're comparing proposals, I'd recommend looking at these differences:

1. Do they understand [Q4 root cause]?
   - Most vendors will miss this and repeat what didn't work before

2. Are they building prerequisites first?
   - Or jumping straight to AI (which will fail without foundation)

3. Do they have [vertical] expertise?
   - Generic AI agencies don't know [industry] operations like we do

After you've done your comparison, I'm confident we'll stand out. But if another vendor is a better fit, I'll be the first to tell you.

When's your decision timeline?
```

**Objection 5: "Can we start with a smaller pilot?"**

**Response:**
```
Yes - here's how we'd structure a pilot:

Phase 1 (Prerequisites) becomes the pilot: $[Phase 1 cost]

Pilot success criteria:
- [Deliverable 1] completed
- [Deliverable 2] completed
- You see [X%] improvement in [metric]

If pilot succeeds → We proceed to Phase 2 (AI implementation)
If pilot doesn't meet criteria → You've still gotten value from [prerequisites] and can stop

Make sense? This de-risks the project for you.
```

### Closing Techniques

**Assumptive Close:**
```
"Great, sounds like we're aligned. I'll send the contract today and we can kick off [next week/next month]. Does Monday work for the kickoff call?"
```

**Choice Close:**

## POST-SALE: RETAINER CONVERSION

### Goal
Convert 70%+ of project clients to recurring revenue

### When to Pitch Retainer

**Option A: At proposal stage**
- Include optional retainer in initial proposal
- Plant the seed early
- "Most clients keep us on retainer for ongoing optimization"

**Option B: At Phase 1 completion**
- Natural checkpoint
- They've seen value from prerequisites
- Momentum to continue

**Option C: At project completion**
- Final delivery meeting
- Demonstrate ROI achieved
- Transition to ongoing support

**Recommended: Use all 3 (mention early, reinforce mid-project, close at end)**

### Retainer Pitch Script

**At project completion:**

```
"[Client name], we're wrapping up the project and you're now live with [deliverables].

Before we close this out, I want to talk about what happens next.

Here's what we typically see:

Month 1-2: You use the system, find a few bugs, need some tweaks
Month 3-4: You want to expand to [other department/use case]
Month 6+: Your competitors copy what you're doing, you need to stay ahead

The companies that succeed with AI don't do one-time builds. They treat it as ongoing competitive advantage.

That's why we offer Engineering-as-a-Service retainers:

TIER 1: Maintenance & Support ($[X,XXX]/month)
- We fix bugs, handle updates, provide user support
- Peace of mind that things keep working

TIER 2: Engineering-as-a-Service ($[XX,XXX]/month)
- Everything in Tier 1, plus:
- Ongoing feature development
- Expand to other departments
- Keep improving based on usage

TIER 3: AI Operating System ($[XX,XXX]/month)
- Everything in Tier 2, plus:
- Full strategic partnership
- We run your entire AI operation
- Continuous innovation

My recommendation for [Company]: Start with Tier 2.

You'll want to expand this to [other areas]. Having us on retainer means you don't start from scratch each time.

Let's do a 3-month trial. If you don't see the value, cancel anytime.

Make sense?"
```

### Retainer Objection Handling

**Objection: "We just spent $[XX,XXX], we need to see ROI first"**

**Response:**
```
Totally understand. Here's why now is actually the right time:

The $[XX,XXX] you invested gets you to [current state]. That's great.

But in 3 months, you'll want:
- [Expansion area 1]
- [Expansion area 2]
- [Optimization area]

If you wait until then to engage us, there's:
- Delay while we ramp back up
- Knowledge transfer again
- Potential for system to break without maintenance

The retainer locks in our knowledge NOW while it's fresh.

Think of it like buying a car: you don't skip oil changes after paying for the car.

We can start with a 3-month trial at $[X,XXX]/month. That's $[total] to ensure your $[XX,XXX] investment keeps working and improving.

What feels like a reasonable trial period for you?
```

**Objection: "Can we just pay as we go?"**

**Response:**
```
We could do that, but here's the problem:

Ad-hoc pricing: $200-300/hour
Monthly retainer: Equivalent to $125-150/hour

You'll pay 2x more for the same work.

Plus, retainers get priority:
- Same-day response on issues
- Proactive optimization
- First in queue for new features

Pay-as-you-go gets:
- 3-5 day response time
- Reactive only (you have to ask)
- Back of the queue

For the value you'll get, retainer makes more sense.

Want to try it for 3 months and compare?
```

### Retainer Contract

**Key Terms:**
- Monthly recurring (auto-renews)
- 30-day cancellation notice
- Scope: [X hours per month] + priority support
- Overage: [$X/hour] for work beyond scope
- Payment: Auto-charge 1st of month

**Retainer Management:**
- Track hours in project management tool
- Monthly report showing hours used + work completed
- Quarterly business reviews (QBRs) for Tier 2+
- Proactive suggestions for optimization

## VERTICAL-SPECIFIC PLAYBOOKS

### Defense Vertical (Mekaiel)

**Unique Characteristics:**
- Long sales cycles (3-6 months typical)
- Procurement processes (RFPs, GSA schedules)
- Security compliance requirements (FedRAMP, NIST, DoD IL5)
- Clearance considerations
- Government fiscal year timing (October)

**Key Pain Points:**
- Legacy systems that can't integrate
- Security compliance slows AI adoption
- Manual processes in operations
- Siloed data across departments

**Positioning:**
"Military-grade systematic discipline for AI adoption. Built by former DoD/DoS network security engineer with active Secret Clearance."

**Prerequisites Common to Defense:**
- Security compliance audit
- Authority to Operate (ATO) requirements
- Integration with classified networks
- Air-gapped deployment options

**Pricing Considerations:**
- Higher budgets ($50K-$200K typical)
- Performance-based preferred (government loves measurable ROI)
- Multi-year contracts possible

**Objection Handling:**
"How do you handle classified data?"
→ "We build air-gapped systems or work within your security boundary. I have active Secret Clearance and 9 years DoD/DoS experience. We follow your security protocols."

### Industrial Vertical (4.0 Hero)

**Unique Characteristics:**
- Production uptime is critical (can't disrupt operations)
- OT/IT convergence challenges
- Legacy SCADA/MES/ERP systems
- Plant floor resistance to change

**Key Pain Points:**
- Production data exists but isn't actionable
- IIoT projects stall due to complexity
- Disconnected systems
- Manual workflows in engineering

**Positioning:**
"22 years industrial automation experience. We know what works on plant floors, not just in PowerPoints."

**Prerequisites Common to Industrial:**
- Production data infrastructure audit
- OT network security
- Sensor/IoT integration
- Legacy system modernization

**Pricing Considerations:**
- ROI in terms of OEE, downtime reduction, quality
- Pilot on one line/machine, then scale
- CapEx vs OpEx considerations

**Objection Handling:**
"We can't afford downtime for implementation"
→ "We implement during planned maintenance windows or on parallel systems. 22 years in automation - I've never disrupted a production line."

### E-commerce Vertical (Matthew)

**Unique Characteristics:**
- Fast-moving (retailers move FAST)
- Peak season considerations (Q4)
- Integration with e-commerce platforms
- Direct ROI tracking (conversion, AOV, LTV)

**Key Pain Points:**
- Manual customer service
- Inventory chaos
- Content creation bottleneck
- Can't scale operations

**Positioning:**
"Built by Amazon engineers who also run e-commerce businesses. We understand both sides."

**Prerequisites Common to E-commerce:**
- E-commerce platform integration (Shopify, WooCommerce)
- Customer data infrastructure
- Inventory/order management connections
- Email/SMS automation setup

**Pricing Considerations:**
- Lower budgets ($10K-$50K typical)
- Performance-based works well (% of revenue increase)
- Fast implementation timelines (4-8 weeks)

**Objection Handling:**
"We need this done before Q4"
→ "We can fast-track to 6 weeks. I've built e-commerce systems at Amazon speed. We'll prioritize must-haves for Q4, nice-to-haves for Q1."

### Construction Vertical (Chris)

**Unique Characteristics:**
- Field-to-office communication gaps
- Mobile/offline requirements
- Project-based revenue (not recurring)
- Thin margins, cost-sensitive

**Key Pain Points:**
- Manual estimating (slow, error-prone)
- Project tracking chaos
- Communication gaps
- Lost revenue from poor change orders

**Positioning:**
"11+ years construction experience. Recovered $500K+ in lost revenue through process improvements. We know construction operations."

**Prerequisites Common to Construction:**
- Project management system integration (Procore, Buildertrend)
- Document management infrastructure
- Field data collection (drones, mobile apps)
- Estimating database cleanup

**Pricing Considerations:**
- ROI in time savings + revenue recovery
- Drone/progress tracking as entry point
- Expand from estimating → project tracking → full PM

**Objection Handling:**
"Our margins are too thin for this"
→ "I recovered $500K at Elite Underground in one year. Your margins are thin because you're losing revenue to inefficiency. This pays for itself in 6 months."

## COMMON SCENARIOS & RESPONSES

### Scenario 1: "Can you send me a case study?"

**Response:**
```
"We're launching this vertical this quarter, so client names are under NDA. But here's what I can share:

My background: [Your specific credibility from vertical]

What we've built: [Generic description of similar projects without naming clients]

Here's what I'd recommend: Let's do a 15-minute discovery call. I'll learn about your specific situation and show you exactly how we'd approach it. If it resonates, we move forward. If not, no worries.

Sound fair?"
```

### Scenario 2: "We need this done in 2 weeks"

**Response:**
```
"I appreciate the urgency. Let me be direct:

Full solution in 2 weeks: Not possible. We'd be cutting corners and you'd get a system that breaks.

Here's what IS possible in 2 weeks:
- [Quick win deliverable 1]
- [Quick win deliverable 2]

Then we build the full solution over [realistic timeline].

This way you get immediate value in 2 weeks, plus the robust long-term solution.

Would that work?"
```

### Scenario 3: "Can we pay you in equity instead of cash?"

**Response:**
```
"Potentially, but it depends on the opportunity size and distribution potential.

For equity deals, we look for:
- Large TAM (this could become a $10M+ business)
- You have massive distribution (can scale beyond yourself)
- This could become a standalone product

If those apply, let's explore a co-ownership model where we take reduced cash + equity.

If not, we'd need standard cash terms.

Which category does this fall into?"
```

### Scenario 4: "We want to hire you full-time instead"

**Response:**
```
"I'm flattered, but I'm committed to building AriseGroup.

However, here's what might work:

Instead of hiring me, what if AriseGroup becomes your outsourced AI department?

Tier 3 Retainer ($[XX,XXX]/month):
- You get dedicated capacity
- Strategic partnership
- Ongoing development
- Priority access

It's like having me full-time, but:
- No overhead (benefits, office, etc.)
- Access to full team (not just me)
- Flexibility to scale up/down

Want to explore this?"
```

### Scenario 5: "Can you work on spec and get paid if it works?"

**Response:**
```
"I don't do spec work, here's why:

We're not unproven - [your track record]. We know our solutions work.

The risk isn't whether the tech works. The risk is whether your team adopts it.

That's a change management risk, not a technical risk. And that's on you, not us.

What I CAN do:

Pilot approach:
- Phase 1 only ($[X,XXX])
- Defined success criteria
- If it hits criteria → Phase 2
- If not → We part ways

This de-risks it for you without me working for free.

Make sense?"
```
