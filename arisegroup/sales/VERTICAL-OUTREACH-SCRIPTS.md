- **Timing:** Tuesday-Thursday, 9-11am or 2-4pm local time
- **Follow-up:** If no response in 3 days, send follow-up (template below)
- **Personalize:** Change first sentence to reference their company/recent post/news

### Success Metrics

- **Response rate target:** 20-30% (warm network), 5-10% (cold outreach)
- **Call booking rate:** 10-15% of responses
- **Goal per founder:** 5-10 calls booked in Week 1

### Script 1A: WARM NETWORK (Former Colleagues/Contacts)

**Subject:** Quick question about AI + scaling your firm

**Body:**

Hey [Name],

Hope you're doing well at [Company]. Quick question for you:

Are you dealing with the classic services firm problem—too much manual work in sales and operations, but can't scale without hiring more people?

I'm working with B2B service firms on AI transformation that actually delivers business outcomes: shorter sales cycles, higher conversion, and hours reclaimed every week.

Not generic software. Custom AI systems built around your unique workflows while keeping the high-touch service your clients expect.

I'm running 5 free AI discovery sessions this week for professional services firms to map out what's actually possible.

No pitch. Just 5 questions to understand your operations, then I'll show you a roadmap.

15 minutes. Interested?

- System integrators (former clients from Omron, Xigent, PK Controls)
- OEMs (original equipment manufacturers)
- Manufacturing operations teams
- Industrial automation engineers
- Industry 4.0 professionals in your network

### Pain Points They Face

### Script 2A: WARM NETWORK (Former Clients/Colleagues)

**Subject:** AI + IIoT for [Company Name]?

**Body:**

Hey [Name],

Hope things are going well at [Company].

Quick question: Are you under pressure to implement AI/IIoT at [Company], but struggling to make it practical and production-ready?

After 22 years in industrial automation, I've seen most AI initiatives fail because they're built by people who've never been on a plant floor.

I'm now helping system integrators and OEMs implement AI that actually works in industrial environments (not just demos).

Running 5 free discovery sessions this week for automation companies. 15 minutes. I ask about your operations, you get a roadmap showing where AI can actually add value.

No pitch. Just questions.

### Script 2B: COLD OUTREACH (LinkedIn)

**Subject:** AI for industrial automation (practical, not hype)

**Body:**

[Name],

Saw you're at [Company] working on [automation/IIoT/Industry 4.0].

Quick question: Is [Company] exploring AI for production systems, but finding most vendors don't understand industrial environments?

Most AI agencies pitch flashy demos. We build production-ready systems because we actually come from industrial automation (22 years, not 2).

We help system integrators and OEMs:
- Turn production data into actionable insights
- Connect legacy systems with modern AI
- Implement IIoT without disrupting operations
- Build AI-augmented workflows that engineers actually use

Hey [Name],

Hope things are going well at [Company].

Quick question: Are you still dealing with manual estimating, project tracking chaos, and lost revenue from poor change order documentation?

Now I'm helping construction firms and portable building manufacturers implement AI to fix these problems:
- Automated estimating (70% faster, I did this at Elite)
- Project tracking and progress reporting (using drone data + AI)
- Change order documentation and revenue recovery
- Safety and compliance automation
