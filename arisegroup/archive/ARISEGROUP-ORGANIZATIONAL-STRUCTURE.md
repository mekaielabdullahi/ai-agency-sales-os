**Status:** FOUNDING STRUCTURE PROPOSAL
**Founders:** Mekaiel (Defense), 4.0 Hero (Industrial), Matthew (E-commerce/Tech), Chris (Construction)

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

**The Challenge:**
4 founders running separate businesses want to build AriseGroup as a unified AI transformation firm while:
- Keeping existing revenue streams alive
- Pursuing individual verticals
- Building shared IP and systems
- Working project-by-project initially
- Transitioning to full unified company over time

**The Solution:**
AriseGroup as a **Digital Franchise Holding Company** with 4 specialized verticals, shared tech assets, and a tiered revenue/equity model that rewards contribution.

---

## SECTION 1: THE STRUCTURE

### AriseGroup Parent Company

**Legal Entity:** AriseGroup LLC (or Inc.)
**Ownership:** 4 Co-Founders (equity split defined below)
**Purpose:** Unified brand, shared tech assets, centralized operations

### The 4 Verticals (Sub-brands)

Each vertical operates as a **division** of AriseGroup, not a separate legal entity:

#### 1. AriseGroup Defense
- **Lead:** Mekaiel
- **Target Market:** Defense contractors, government agencies, cybersecurity firms
- **Positioning:** "AI Operating Systems for Defense Contractors - Built by Former DoD/DoS Network Security Engineer"
- **Advantage:** Active Secret Clearance + 9 years DoD/DoS experience

#### 2. AriseGroup Industrial
- **Lead:** 4.0 Hero Founder
- **Target Market:** System integrators, OEMs, manufacturing, industrial automation teams
- **Positioning:** "AI + IIoT Transformation for Industrial Operations - 22 Years of Automation Expertise"
- **Advantage:** Deep industry experience + existing 4.0 Hero network

#### 3. AriseGroup Commerce
- **Lead:** Matthew
- **Target Market:** E-commerce brands, retail operations, online businesses
- **Positioning:** "AI Operating Systems for E-commerce - Built by Amazon Engineers"

- **Positioning:** "AI + Process Optimization for Construction - 11+ Years of Project Excellence"
- **Advantage:** Proven track record ($500K+ recovered revenue, 70% efficiency gains)

---

## SECTION 2: EQUITY & REVENUE MODEL

### Phase 1: Project-by-Project (Months 1-6)

**Structure:** Founder who brings the client is "Lead," others are "Contributors"

**Revenue Split per Project:**
- **Lead (client originator):** 40%
- **Contributors (delivery team):** 40% split based on hours worked
- **AriseGroup (company fund):** 20%

**Example:**
- Mekaiel closes $20K Defense contract
- Matthew builds the tech (20 hours)
- Chris helps with implementation (10 hours)
- **Distribution:**
  - Mekaiel (Lead): $8K (40%)
  - Matthew: $5.3K (20 hours / 30 total hours × $8K)
  - Chris: $2.7K (10 hours / 30 total hours × $8K)
  - AriseGroup fund: $4K (20%)

**AriseGroup Fund Purpose:**
- Build shared tech assets (AriseCore)
- Marketing/branding costs
- Shared infrastructure (CRM, tools, etc.)
- Eventually pays salaries when you go full-time

### Phase 2: Recurring Revenue Model (Months 6-12)

**Structure:** All retainer revenue goes to AriseGroup, founders get salaries + bonuses

**Salary Structure:**
- **Base:** Equal salaries for all 4 founders (from MRR pool)
- **Bonus:** Based on individual vertical performance
- **Equity:** Based on founding contribution + ongoing value

**Example:**
- AriseGroup has $40K/month MRR from retainers
- Each founder gets $6K/month base salary = $24K
- Remaining $16K split:
  - $8K → AriseGroup operating fund
  - $8K → Performance bonuses based on:
    - New MRR added by vertical
    - Client retention in vertical
    - Tech asset contributions

### Phase 3: Full Company Model (Year 2+)

**Structure:** AriseGroup as standalone company, founders are full-time employees + equity owners

**Equity Split Options:**

#### Option A: Equal Split (Simple)
- 25% each founder
- Clean, no politics
- Best if everyone contributes equally

#### Option B: Weighted Split (Based on Contribution)
- Mekaiel: 30% (founder, CEO, initial vision)
- 4.0 Hero: 25% (most industry experience)
- Matthew: 25% (tech infrastructure lead)
- Chris: 20% (process optimization + construction vertical)
- **Adjustable based on first 6 months performance**

#### Option C: Vesting Split (Earn Over Time)
- All 4 start at 25% each
- Vests over 4 years (standard startup model)
- If someone leaves early, equity redistributes
- Protects against early departures

**Recommendation:** Start with Option B (weighted) with annual re-evaluation based on contribution.

## SECTION 10: RISK MITIGATION

### Risk #1: Time Commitment Imbalance
**Problem:** One founder puts in 20 hours/week, another puts in 5 hours/week

**Mitigation:**
- Track time spent per project (use Toggl or Clockify)
- Revenue split reflects actual contribution (40% contributor pool split by hours)
- Quarterly check-ins on commitment levels
- If persistent imbalance → adjust equity/roles

### Risk #2: Vertical Performance Imbalance
**Problem:** One vertical closes 10 deals, another closes 0

**Mitigation:**
- Don't panic in first 3 months (too early to tell)
- At 6 months, evaluate vertical viability
- Option to sunset underperforming vertical
- Founder can pivot to support successful verticals

### Risk #3: Founder Conflict
**Problem:** Disagreements on strategy, pricing, or direction

**Mitigation:**
- Weekly syncs catch issues early
- Decision framework prevents gridlock
- Tie-breaker mechanism (Mekaiel as CEO)
- Worst case: Buy-out clause in Founder Agreement

### Risk #4: Cash Flow Pressure
**Problem:** Not enough AriseGroup revenue to justify time investment

**Mitigation:**
- Keep existing businesses for first 6 months
- No pressure to go full-time until MRR supports it
- 20% company fund builds cash reserves
- Project-based work generates immediate cash

### Risk #5: Client Confusion
**Problem:** Clients don't understand if they're working with AriseGroup or individual businesses

**Mitigation:**
- All AriseGroup projects branded as "AriseGroup"
- Clear positioning: "AriseGroup - 4 specialists under one brand"
- Existing business clients stay with existing businesses
- Clean separation between old clients (solo) and new clients (AriseGroup)

---

**Must-Have Clauses:**

### 1. Equity Ownership

- Tie-breaker mechanism

### 5. Intellectual Property
- All AriseGroup work = AriseGroup IP

- Non-compete during employment

### 6. Exit Clauses
- Buy-out terms if founder wants to leave
- Valuation methodology
- Right of first refusal
- Non-solicitation (can't steal clients/team)

### 7. Adding New Founders/Equity

## FINAL NOTE

**You have a rare advantage:**

Most agencies have 1 founder scrambling to find a vertical. You have 4 founders with 4 built-in verticals and 50+ years of combined expertise.

The structure above lets you:
- Start small (10-15 hours/week each)
- Keep existing revenue streams
- Build AriseGroup together
- Share the risk and reward
- Scale to full-time when ready

**The key is execution.**

This document gives you the structure. Now you need:
1. Founder meeting to agree on terms
2. Week 1 execution to prove it works
3. 90 days to build momentum
4. 6 months to decide: Full-time or pivot?

**Are you ready to schedule the Founder Meeting?**

---

**Document Owner:** All 4 Founders
**Status:** PROPOSAL - Needs Founder Approval
**Next Step:** Schedule 2-hour Founder Meeting to review and vote
