## Scoring Tips & Best Practices

### Revenue Assessment
- Look for: Employee count (10+ = $1M+), multiple locations, client testimonials mentioning price/scale
- Red flags: Solopreneur with no team, brand new startup, hobby business

### Digital Maturity Assessment
- Look for: CRM mentions in job postings, marketing automation, integrated booking systems
- Red flags: No website, Gmail email address, no online booking

### Lead Volume Assessment
- Ask directly if unclear: "How many leads are you currently generating per month?"
- Look for: Ad spend indicators, sales team size, marketing department

### Industry Fit Assessment
**High-Fit Industries:**
- Healthcare (dentists, med spas, clinics)
- Real Estate (agencies, brokerages)
- Home Services (HVAC, plumbing, electrical)
- Professional Services (legal, accounting, consulting)
- Coaching & Education
- E-commerce (with high volume)

**Low-Fit Industries:**
- Pure manufacturing (physical-only)
- Low-margin retail
- One-time project businesses
