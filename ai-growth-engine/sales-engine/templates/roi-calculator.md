## Quick Reference Formulas

### Time Savings Value
```
Hours Saved Per Week × 4.33 × Hourly Rate = Monthly Value
```

### Lead Recovery Value
```
(Leads Recovered × Conversion Rate) × Average Deal Value = Monthly Value
```

### No-Show Reduction Value
```
(Appointments × Current No-Show % - Appointments × New No-Show %) × Avg Appointment Value = Monthly Value
```

### Efficiency Gain Value
```
Current Process Time - Automated Process Time = Time Saved
Time Saved × Volume × Hourly Rate = Monthly Value
```

### Break-Even Formula
```
Total Investment ÷ Monthly Benefit = Months to Break-Even
```

### ROI Percentage Formula
```
((Total Benefit - Investment) ÷ Investment) × 100 = ROI %
```

*Use conservative estimates when uncertain. Under-promise, over-deliver.*
*Always provide range estimates (best/realistic/conservative) for credibility.*
*Focus on quantifiable, verifiable metrics whenever possible.*
