## Need Help?

**Unclear revenue?** Look for: team size, office locations, client logos, pricing pages
**Unclear tech stack?** Look for: website footer, careers page (tools mentioned), integrations page
**Unclear lead volume?** Default to 3 unless evidence suggests otherwise
**Unclear industry fit?** Ask: "Do they have repetitive, high-volume workflows?"
