## 🚨 Common Implementation Mistakes

### Mistake 1: Skipping Customization
**Problem:** Using templates with placeholders and generic content
**Solution:** Spend Day 1-2 customizing everything before first client

### Mistake 2: Not Training Team
**Problem:** Team doesn't know how to use the system
**Solution:** Mandatory 4-week training program

### Mistake 3: Cherry-Picking Templates
**Problem:** Using some templates but not others, breaking the system
**Solution:** Use the complete system as designed

### Mistake 4: Ignoring Standards
**Problem:** Engineers bypass quality standards "just this once"
**Solution:** Enforce standards with peer review and QA gates

### Mistake 5: Poor Client Communication
**Problem:** Not using communication protocol, sporadic updates
**Solution:** Use email templates, send weekly updates religiously
