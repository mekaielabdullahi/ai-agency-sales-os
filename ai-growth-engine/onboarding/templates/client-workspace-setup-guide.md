## Tips for Success

1. **Consistency is Key:** Use the same structure for every client
2. **Update Regularly:** Stale dashboards erode trust
3. **Client-Focused:** The Notion dashboard is for them—keep it simple and clear
4. **Security:** Never put credentials in Notion or Drive
5. **Automation:** Consider automating workspace creation with Zapier/Make

*A well-organized workspace = A well-run project*
