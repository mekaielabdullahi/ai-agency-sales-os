## Section 7: Q&A (10 minutes)

> "Alright, that's everything we wanted to cover. Now it's your turn—what questions do you have?"

---

### Common Questions & Answers

**Q: "What if I think of changes or additions mid-project?"**
A: "Great question. Small tweaks are no problem and are part of the process. Larger scope changes, we'll discuss impact on timeline and cost. The best time to bring up changes is at the Week 2 architecture review—that's when it's easiest to adjust."

---

**Q: "What happens if something breaks after you build it?"**
A: "We include 30 days of post-launch support to handle any bugs or issues. After that, many clients opt for a monthly support retainer, but we'll discuss that closer to go-live."

---

**Q: "How much will my team need to learn?"**
A: "We design systems to be as hands-off as possible. Your team will get training on how to monitor the system and handle common tasks, but most of it runs automatically. The training is simple—usually 1-2 hours is enough."

---

**Q: "Can we add more automations later?"**
A: "Absolutely! Many clients start with the core system and add more automations once they see the impact. We can discuss future enhancements anytime."

---

**Q: "What if our systems change or update?"**
A: "Good thinking. We build with that in mind—our systems are flexible and can adapt. If a platform does a major update, we'll monitor for issues and make adjustments if needed."
