### Stage 3: Connection
**Touchpoint:** DM or connection request

**Approach:** Non-salesy, curious, value-first

**DM Templates:**

- After multiple engagements: "I've noticed you engaging with my content. Curious what you're working on?"

### Stage 4: Conversation

**Goal:** Qualify and invite to discovery call
**Questions to understand:**
- What kind of business?
- What's the main challenge?

## Disqualification Criteria

Not every lead is a good fit. Disqualify early if:

- **Budget mismatch:** Can't invest $5K minimum
- **Timeline mismatch:** Need it done "yesterday" without flexibility
- **Expectation mismatch:** Want magic, not implementation
- **Values mismatch:** Don't respect the process or the work
- **Wrong stage:** Not ready to make a decision

**How to disqualify gracefully:**
"Based on what you've shared, I don't think I'm the right fit for this. Here's what I'd recommend instead: [suggestion]."
