## Content Rules

1. **No fluff** — Every post must have a specific takeaway
2. **Include metrics** — Numbers create credibility (%, $, time saved)
3. **Name the pain** — Start with recognition, not solution
4. **One idea per post** — Don't dilute the message
5. **CTA varies** — Not every post needs a pitch; most should give value

## Content Quality Checklist

Before publishing, verify:

- [ ] Would a busy owner stop scrolling?
- [ ] Is there a specific, actionable insight?
- [ ] Does it sound like me (not generic AI)?
- [ ] Could a competitor copy-paste this? (If yes, add specifics)
- [ ] Is the hook strong enough for the first 2 lines?
