## 7. RISK MITIGATION

### Risk Assessment Matrix

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation Strategy |
|------|------------|--------|-------------------|
| **Customer adoption slower than expected** | Medium | High | Pilot program, incentives, messaging refinement |
| **Technical complexity/integration issues** | Low | Medium | Use proven technologies, pilot before scale |
| **Budget constraints mid-project** | Medium | Medium | Phased approach, each phase self-funding |
| **Competitor launches PPP first** | Low | Medium | First-mover locally, customer relationships = moat |
| **Team resistance to change** | Low | Low | Training, involvement in design, gradual rollout |

---

### Detailed Mitigation Strategies

**Risk 1: Customer Adoption Slower Than Expected**

**Scenario**: Customers hesitant to switch from buying printers to paying per page

**Mitigation**:
1. **Pilot with 3-5 customers in Phase 2**
   - Test messaging and pricing
   - Gather feedback
   - Refine before scaling

2. **Early Adopter Incentives**
   - Discounted rates for first 10 customers
   - Free trial period (first month)
   - Grandfathered pricing

3. **Customer Education**
   - ROI calculators showing cost savings
   - Case studies from industry leaders
   - Transparent comparisons (buy vs PPP)

4. **Flexible Options**
   - Offer both models (buy OR PPP)
   - Gradual transition (test before committing)
   - Easy exit if not satisfied

---

**Risk 2: Technical Complexity**

**Scenario**: Printer integration harder than expected

**Mitigation**:
1. **Use Proven Technologies**
   - PaperCut, PrinterLogic (95%+ printer compatibility)
   - Not building from scratch
   - Established vendor support

2. **Pilot with Common Models First**
   - Start with HP, Canon, Xerox (most common)
   - Validate before expanding to niche printers

3. **Backup Plan**
   - Manual entry option (if auto-tracking fails)
   - Hybrid approach (auto + manual)
   - Partner with printer manufacturers if needed

---

**Risk 3: Budget Constraints**

**Scenario**: Cash flow becomes tight mid-project

**Mitigation**:
1. **Phased Investment**
   - Phase 1 pays for Phase 2
   - Don't commit to full roadmap upfront
   - Stop anytime if ROI not materializing

2. **Financing Options**
   - Business line of credit
   - Vendor financing
   - SBA loans (if needed)

3. **Flexible Timeline**
   - Extend phases if needed (slower but safer)
   - Pause between phases to accumulate funds
   - No penalty for delayed Phase 2/3 start

---

**Risk 4: Competitor First-Mover**

**Scenario**: Local competitor launches PPP before you

**Mitigation**:
1. **Speed to Market**
   - Fast Phase 1 execution
   - Pilot in 90 days (before most competitors)

2. **Customer Relationships**
   - Existing customers = switching cost for competitor
   - Trust and history = competitive moat

3. **Differentiation**
   - Superior service (proactive, not just reactive)
   - Better technology (AI-powered)
   - Local focus (not corporate)

**Even if competitor launches first, you can still win with better execution and service.**
