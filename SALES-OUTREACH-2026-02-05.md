|-------|-------|
| Phone | ❌ **NEED TO CAPTURE** |

| Status | 🔥 HOT LEAD |
| Last Contact | February 1, 2026 |

### Context
- Multi-location dealership delivery operation
- Plans to expand to Montana, Washington
- Paying drivers $60/hr as business scales
- **Previously used WorkWave** - misses the one-click location features

### Pain Points (Quantified)
1. **Manual GPS process** — ~3 min per delivery pulling coordinates from PDFs
2. **No customer-to-driver communication** — nowhere to send details
3. **Dry runs & wasted trips** — no scheduled return pickups with pinpoints
4. **Driver anxiety** — approaching unknown locations without context
5. **Legacy system gap** — current system requires manual extraction

### Solution He Wants
- Google Earth custom pinpoints with real-time location
- Customer self-service portal for location/photos
- QR/scannable system for each building "slot"
- Hyperlinked data from existing spreadsheets

### Budget Signal
> "Willing to finance Phase 1 immediately to get the ball rolling"

### Phone Script
```

delivery pinpoint system. I wanted to follow up — I've been working on the
Phase 1 prototype for the customer-facing location submission. Quick question:
what's the best email to send the demo mockup to? Also, I realized I didn't
grab your direct line last time..."
```

### Voicemail Script
```
"Hey Scott, [Name] from Arise. Following up on our delivery logistics
conversation. Got a prototype coming together for the customer location
portal. Give me a call back at [your number] or shoot me a text with
your email. Talk soon."
```

### Email (After Voicemail)
```
Subject: Phase 1 Prototype - Delivery Location System

Scott,

Following up on our call last week. I've been working on the Phase 1
deliverables we discussed:

• Customer-facing link for location/photo submission
• Centralized spreadsheet capturing all submissions
• Hyperlinks from existing data for instant location access
• QR code/placard kit framework

I'd like to show you a quick mockup and get your feedback before
we finalize. What's a good time for a 15-minute screen share?

Best,
[Name]
Arise Group
```

### Next Steps
1. ⚠️ **Capture email/phone** — critical missing info
2. Prepare Phase 1 demo
3. Send follow-up email
4. Target 2-3 week delivery

### Contact Info

|-------|-------|
| Phone | Via Chris (drone data contact) |
| Email | — |
| Status | 🔥 HOT - Active Project |
| Last Contact | February 4, 2026 |
| Source | Referral |

### Context
- Drone surveying client
- **Active project — 50% complete**
- Working relationship with Chris
- Chris delivering flight data tomorrow

### Key Finding
> **8,500-yard dirt variance** confirmed by multiple local drone pilots

### Pain Points
1. PDF civil plans cannot deliver volumetric data (needs CAD/DXF)
2. Drone Deploy can't process PDFs into volumetrics
3. Current deliverables only 50% complete
4. $3,500/year software underutilized

### Market Opportunity
| Service | Price Range |
|---------|-------------|
| 20-acre site survey | $1,700 - $2,500 |
| Additional processing | +$150 |

### Phone Script (via Chris)
```
"Hey Burt, this is [Name] — I work with Chris on the drone surveying.
Wanted to give you a heads up: the flight data is coming your way [tomorrow],
and we found that 8,500-yard variance we suspected. Quick thing — to get the
full volumetric breakdown, we'll need the CAD or DXF files, not just the PDFs.
Can you get those from your civil engineer?"
```

### Email (After Voicemail)
```
Subject: Dirt Quantities Report — CAD Files Needed

Burt,

Quick update on the survey project:

1. Chris is delivering flight data by noon tomorrow
2. We've confirmed the 8,500-yard variance
3. To deliver full volumetric analysis, we need CAD/DXF files
   (PDFs won't work for quantities)

Can you request the CAD files from your civil engineer? Once we have
those, we can provide the complete variance report.

Also — the additional quantity calculations run $150. Want us to
include that in the final deliverable?

Let me know,
[Name]
```

### Next Steps
1. ✅ Chris to deliver flight data by noon tomorrow
2. ⚠️ Communicate CAD/DXF requirement (PDFs insufficient)
3. Provide variance report showing 8,500-yard discrepancy
4. Discuss $150 additional processing fee

| Status | WARM - Re-engagement |
| Last Contact | December 28, 2025 |
| Company | S&S Wolf Sheds |
| Locations | Flagstaff, Williams, Cuba (Northern AZ) |

### Context
- Family connection (warm lead)
- **Previous proposal missed the mark**
- She asked: *"How does $10K help me sell more sheds?"*
- 3+ years in business, sales data in Google Drive

### Pain Points
1. **Dealer bonus thresholds** — lag time tracking critical (Cuba, Williams, Flagstaff)
2. **Lost sales in Williams** — Coconino County permitting challenges
3. **$400/month ad spend** — no clear ROI visibility
4. **No geographic sales mapping** — can't see hot vs. cold areas

### What She Needs to See
- ✅ Visual mockups (not text-heavy proposals)
- ✅ Dealer bonus tracker dashboard
- ✅ Sales heatmap by location/building type
- ✅ Ad spend → sales connection

### DO NOT
- ❌ Use technical jargon ("Ops Canvas", "friction points")
- ❌ Present another text-heavy proposal
- ❌ Treat her business like a blank slate

### Phone Script
```
"Hey Sandra! It's [Name]. I've been thinking about our last conversation
and honestly, I didn't do a great job showing you exactly how the system
would help sell more sheds. I put together some visual mockups — dealer
bonus tracker, sales heatmap by location — that I think will make a lot
more sense. Got 15 minutes for a quick screen share?"
```

### Email
```
Subject: New Approach for S&S Wolf Sheds

Sandra,

I've been thinking about your question: "How does $10K help me sell more sheds?"

You were right — I didn't show that clearly last time. So I put together
something different:

📊 Dealer Bonus Tracker — see Cuba, Williams, Flagstaff thresholds in real-time
🗺️ Sales Heatmap — which areas are hot, which are cold
📈 Ad ROI Dashboard — connect your $400/month spend to actual sales

No jargon, no 20-page proposal. Just visual mockups showing exactly
what you'd get.

Worth 15 minutes to walk through?

[Name]
```

### Next Steps
1. Send revised proposal with visual mockups
2. Schedule 15-min walkthrough call
3. Leverage her existing Google Drive data
