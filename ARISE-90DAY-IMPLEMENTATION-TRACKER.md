# ARISEGROUP 90-DAY EXECUTION SYSTEM
## The Daily Rhythm That Builds a $100K+ AI Transformation Firm

**Start:** December 2, 2025 | **End:** March 2, 2026 | **Review:** Every Friday 6pm

## THE CORE PHILOSOPHY

You don't need a 90-day plan.

You need a **90-day rhythm**.

**Daily habits compound.**
**Weekly rituals create momentum.**
**Monthly milestones validate progress.**

This tracker is organized around **what you do daily**, not what you plan weekly.

## 90-DAY TRANSFORMATION SCORECARD

### WHERE YOU START (DAY 0)
- 4 independent contractors
- $0 revenue, $0 MRR
- 0-5 discovery conversations completed
- No LinkedIn presence
- No shared infrastructure
- No reusable tech assets
- Working solo, no team rhythm

### WHERE YOU END (DAY 90)
- **Revenue:** $100K-$250K total signed contracts
- **MRR:** $5K-$15K from 2-4 retainer clients
- **Projects:** 40-70 total closed, 20-30 in delivery/completed
- **Pipeline:** 200+ discovery calls completed, 60+ proposals sent
- **Authority:** 700-1500 LinkedIn followers, 144 posts, thought leadership established
- **Team:** Unified rhythm, high trust, 12 weekly syncs completed
- **Assets:** AriseCore v1 (3 modules), case studies, testimonials, refined process
- **Strategy:** Prerequisites framework implemented, CPO positioning adopted, retainer model live
- **Decision:** Clear path forward (formalize, continue, or gracefully dissolve)

---

## THE DECISION FRAMEWORK (DAY 90)

### OPTION A: FORMALIZE INTO SINGLE ENTITY

**Choose if:**
- ✅ Revenue target hit ($100K+)
- ✅ Team collaboration excellent (8+/10)
- ✅ All 4 founders want to continue
- ✅ MRR growing ($5K-$15K+)
- ✅ Ready to hire and scale

**What happens:**
- Form single AriseGroup LLC
- Define equity split (based on 90-day contribution)
- Hire first team member (VA, designer, junior dev)
- Scale to $50K-$100K MRR in next 90 days

---

### OPTION B: CONTINUE AS INDEPENDENT COLLABORATORS

**Choose if:**
- ✅ Model working but not ready to formalize
- ✅ Want more data (another 90 days)
- ✅ Prefer flexibility over simplicity
- ✅ Some founders not ready for full commitment

**What happens:**
- Refine collaboration framework
- Optimize revenue splits based on learnings
- Expand AriseCore assets
- Re-evaluate at Month 6

---

### OPTION C: DISSOLVE PARTNERSHIP

**Choose if:**
- ❌ Revenue targets missed significantly
- ❌ Team collaboration issues
- ❌ One or more founders want out
- ❌ Model not working as hoped

**What happens (Clean Exit):**
- Each founder keeps originated clients
- Shared IP usage rights maintained
- Distribute any pending payments
- Part as friends, stay in network
- Door open to collaborate later

**All three outcomes are valid. 90 days gives you clarity.**

---

## CRITICAL SUCCESS FACTORS

### WHAT WILL MAKE OR BREAK THE 90 DAYS:

**1. DAILY EXECUTION BEATS PERFECT PLANNING**
- Show up every day for 2-3 hours
- Follow the rhythm: Morning (sales), Midday (delivery), Evening (content)
- Don't overthink, just execute

**2. FRIDAY SYNCS ARE NON-NEGOTIABLE**
- Miss a Friday sync = lose team momentum
- 12 syncs in 90 days = foundation of trust
- Celebrate wins, address blockers, adjust quickly

**3. CONTENT COMPOUNDS SLOWLY**
- First 30 days: Crickets (normal)
- Days 30-60: Traction (followers, engagement)
- Days 60-90: Inbound (DMs, calls from content)
- Don't quit at Day 30 when it feels like nothing is happening

**4. CLOSE DEALS WEEK 1-2 OR ADJUST**
- If no deals by Week 3, something is broken
- Fix: Pricing too high? ICP wrong? Scripts bad? Positioning off?
- Adjust fast, don't wait for Week 12 to realize

**5. PROTECT THE TEAM DYNAMIC**
- Address conflicts immediately (don't let fester)
- Over-communicate in Slack
- Assume good intent
- If one founder is struggling, team helps (don't let them drown)

**6. TRACK REVENUE SPLITS ACCURATELY**
- Use simple spreadsheet: Project, Roles, Revenue, Split %
- Update weekly
- Transparent = no resentment
- Month 6 equity split depends on this data

**Decision #3: Client Disqualification Authority**
