## Current Focus Period

**Q1 2026 — March**

## Strategic Priorities

1. **Rebuild Pipeline from Scratch** — Starting fresh with 3 channels:
   - **Cold email outreach** — Email infrastructure, sequences, lead sourcing, systematic outreach
   - **Warm contacts** — Personal network, referrals, past conversations
   - **Door knocking + networking events** — Local in-person outreach
2. **LinkedIn Presence** — 3 posts/week minimum. The market cannot buy what it cannot see
3. **Build AIOS** — Layer by layer, escape the Operator Trap. Reclaim bandwidth for growth
4. **Execute, Not Plan** — No more planning in silence. Execute in public

## Lead Generation Channels

| Channel | Status | Notes |
| ------- | ------ | ----- |
| Cold Email Outreach | Building | Infrastructure + sequences needed |
| Warm Contacts | Active | Personal network, referrals |
| Door Knocking / Networking | Starting | Local in-person outreach |
| LinkedIn | Active | 3 posts/week target |

## What Success Looks Like

- Pipeline rebuilt with qualified prospects responding
- Cold email infrastructure live and sending
- LinkedIn generating inbound interest
- AIOS Layer 1 (Context) fully operational
- Task Automation % climbing from 0%

## Key Decisions / Open Questions

- Which data sources to connect first for Layer 2 (DataOS)
- Telegram vs other channel for CommandOS (Layer 3)
- Priority order for task automation after audit

## The Mindset

> "The gap between what you can do and what the market knows you can do is the gap between where you are and where you belong."

Execute. Ship. Move. The system is ready. The only thing left is to move.
