## Step-by-Step Installation

### 1. Prepare Your Source Material

1. Open the [Claude Code OS YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gujqOjzYzY8)
2. Click "Show more" below the video to expand the description
3. Click "Show transcript" to display the video transcript
4. Select the entire transcript and copy it to your clipboard

### 2. Install Required Tools

1. **Install VS Code**
   - Download from [code.visualstudio.com](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
   - Follow the installation wizard for your operating system

2. **Install Claude Code CLI**
   - Open your terminal
   - Follow the official Claude Code installation guide
   - Verify installation by running `claude --version`

   > **Tip**: If you need help with installation, ChatGPT can guide you through the specific steps for your operating system.

### 3. Set Up Your Project

1. **Create a new folder** on your computer for your project
2. **Open VS Code** and navigate to File > Open Folder
3. **Select your new folder** to open it as a workspace

### 4. Add Your Transcript

1. In VS Code, create a new file called `transcript.txt`
2. Paste the YouTube video transcript you copied earlier
3. Save the file (Cmd+S / Ctrl+S)

### 5. Launch Claude Code CLI

1. Open the bottom pane in VS Code:
   - Look for three buttons in the top-right corner of VS Code (left pane, bottom pane, right pane)
   - Click the "Toggle Panel" button or use the keyboard shortcut (Cmd+J / Ctrl+J)
2. In the terminal panel, run:
   ```bash
   claude
   ```
3. Select your preferred model by running:
   ```
   /model
   ```
   - Select **Opus** for best results on complex system generation

### 6. Generate Your System Structure

Use the following prompt to start building your system:

```
Analyze the transcript in transcript.txt and create a comprehensive, hierarchical folder structure that captures all the key concepts, workflows, and systems described.

For each high-level folder, create an IMPLEMENTATION.md file that includes:
1. Purpose and objectives for this section
2. Key concepts and principles from the transcript
3. Step-by-step implementation plan
4. Templates or frameworks mentioned
5. Success metrics and checkpoints

Start with the folder structure overview, then proceed to create each folder and its implementation plan.
```

### 7. Build Your System

1. **Approve the edits** as Claude generates the structure
2. **Watch the system emerge** as folders and documentation are created
3. **Review the implementation plans** in each folder's IMPLEMENTATION.md

### 8. Implement Specific Sections

Once your structure is built:

1. Navigate to the folder for the area you want to implement first
2. Read the IMPLEMENTATION.md file for that section
3. Prompt Claude to build out that specific functionality
4. Iterate and refine based on your needs

## Quick Start Commands

```bash
# Start Claude Code
claude

# Select model (recommended: Opus)
/model

# Check current working directory
pwd

# List files in current directory
ls -la
```

## Troubleshooting

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| Claude command not found | Reinstall Claude Code CLI and ensure it's in your PATH |
| Transcript too long | Split into multiple files and reference them in your prompt |
| VS Code terminal not opening | Try View > Terminal from the menu bar |
| Model not available | Check your Claude subscription and API access |

---

## Next Steps

After setup is complete:

1. Review the generated folder structure
2. Prioritize which sections to implement first
3. Use the implementation plans as your roadmap
4. Build out one section at a time
5. Iterate and customize for your specific needs
