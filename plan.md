# Plan: Rewrite All 15 Discovery Questions for Maximum Persuasion

## Goal
Rewrite every question in `industry-agnostic-discovery-questions.md` so each one is **engineered to make the prospect WANT to answer** — not just willing, but compelled. Layer in specific psychological persuasion techniques on every question so they can't deflect, give vague answers, or shut down.

## What Changes

### Single file to edit:
`claude-code-os-implementation/02-operations/discovery-process/templates/industry-agnostic-discovery-questions.md`

### What stays the same:
- The 15-question structure (10 warm-up + 5 framework)
- The section headers, listen-for bullets, and follow-up prompts
- The overall flow and transitions
- The post-call reference table and "Why This Sequence Works" section

### What changes — every question gets:

1. **A rewritten primary question** using one or more persuasion techniques (listed below)
2. **A "Persuasion technique" label** — explicit callout of which technique(s) the question uses, so the caller can study and internalize them
3. **A "Why they'll answer" note** — 1-2 sentences explaining the psychology of why this phrasing compels a response
4. **2-3 alternate phrasings** — different persuasion angles for the same question so the caller can pick what feels natural or rotate based on the prospect's personality

## Persuasion Techniques to Deploy (at least one per question)

| Technique | What it does | Example |
|-----------|-------------|---------|
| **Presupposition** | Embeds the answer as assumed fact — skips "do you have a problem?" and jumps to "tell me about the problem" | "When you think about what's slowing growth the most..." (presupposes something IS slowing growth) |
| **Social proof / Normalization** | Makes answering feel safe because "everyone does it" | "Most owners I talk to say X — does that ring true for you?" |
| **Permission-based** | Asks for micro-permission first; once they say yes, they feel committed to answer fully | "Would you be open to walking me through..." |
| **Ego appeal / Expert positioning** | Flatters their expertise so they want to demonstrate knowledge | "You clearly know this space better than anyone — help me understand..." |
| **The takeaway / Negative framing** | "This might not apply to you..." triggers them to prove it does | "I don't know if this is relevant to your world, but..." |
| **Contrast / Binary choice** | Gives two concrete options — both lead to an answer | "Do you lose more on the people side or the process side?" |
| **Embedded command** | Subtly directs them to share by embedding an instruction in the question | "I'd love to hear how you actually..." / "Tell me about..." |
| **Story-based / Third-party** | Uses another client's situation to make it safe to relate | "One of our clients was dealing with X — is anything like that happening for you?" |
| **Reciprocity** | Give an insight or observation first; they feel compelled to reciprocate with honesty | "I noticed [observation about their company]... how does that play out internally?" |
| **Specificity prompt** | Asks for a concrete example, which forces them past vague answers | "Give me the last time that happened — walk me through it step by step" |
| **Emotional labeling** | Names the emotion they're likely feeling — makes them feel seen and understood | "That sounds exhausting..." (they nod and open up more) |

## Question-by-Question Rewrite Plan

### Phase 1 (Q1-Q10): Industry & Operations Deep-Dive

**Q1** (What does your company do?)
- Add: Permission-based opener + ego appeal
- New phrasing: "I want to make sure I really understand your world before I ask anything else. You know this business better than anyone — walk me through what [Company] actually does, like I'm brand new to your industry."
- Why they'll answer: You asked permission, complimented their expertise, and admitted ignorance — triple disarm

**Q2** (What does your typical day look like?)
- Add: Social proof + embedded command + emotional label
- New phrasing: "Most business owners I talk to tell me their day looks nothing like what they planned when they started the company. I'd love to hear what a real day looks like for you — from when you open your laptop to when you finally shut it down."
- Why they'll answer: Social proof normalizes the answer, "I'd love to hear" is an embedded command, "finally shut it down" presupposes overwork they'll identify with

**Q3** (How does money come in the door?)
- Add: Ego appeal + specificity prompt
- New phrasing: "You've clearly built something that works — people are paying you. Help me understand that journey: from someone who's never heard of you, all the way through to them handing you money. What does that path actually look like, step by step?"
- Why they'll answer: "You've clearly built something that works" strokes ego; "step by step" forces specificity over vague answers

**Q4** (What would surprise me about how things get done?)
- Add: Takeaway/negative frame + normalization
- New phrasing: "Every company I've ever worked with has at least one thing happening behind the scenes that they'd never put on their website. The workarounds, the duct tape, the 'we know it's bad but...' stuff. I'm not here to judge — what's yours?"
- Why they'll answer: Normalizes the messiness ("every company"), removes judgment explicitly, makes honesty feel safe because you're in on the joke

**Q5** (What's the most important number you track?)
- Add: Contrast/binary + presupposition
- New phrasing: "When you wake up in the morning and check on the business — is there one number you look at first, or are you more flying by gut feel? Either way is fine, I just want to understand how you keep your finger on the pulse."
- Why they'll answer: Binary choice removes the pressure of a "right" answer; "either way is fine" makes both options safe; presupposes they DO monitor the business

**Q6** (Single point of failure?)
- Add: Story-based + emotional label
- New phrasing: "I had a client last year who told me, 'If our ops manager gets hit by a bus, we're done.' Scared the hell out of them when they said it out loud. What's that thing for you — the one thing that, if it disappeared tomorrow, would bring everything to a halt?"
- Why they'll answer: Third-party story makes it safe to relate; emotional language ("scared the hell out of them") gives them permission to be scared too; specificity of the story makes it feel real

**Q7** (Past solutions that failed?)
- Add: Reciprocity + permission-based + normalization
- New phrasing: "Before we go any further, I want to understand something — because I don't want to repeat anyone else's mistakes. Most companies your size have invested in tools or people to fix problems like this before, and at least one of those didn't work out. Would you be open to telling me what you've tried and what happened?"
- Why they'll answer: You gave a reason (reciprocity — "I don't want to repeat mistakes"), normalized failure ("at least one didn't work"), and asked permission (micro-commitment)

**Q8** (Clone question?)
- Add: Takeaway + humor + embedded command
- New phrasing: "This might sound like a weird question, but it's the one that tells me the most. If you could snap your fingers and clone one person on your team — or yourself — who would it be, and what would you have the clone do all day?"
- Why they'll answer: "Might sound weird" pre-frames it as fun/different; "tells me the most" signals importance so they take it seriously; the hypothetical makes it easy and playful

**Q9** (Industry in 3 years?)
- Add: Presupposition + contrast + ego appeal
- New phrasing: "You've been in this industry long enough to see where it's heading. In 3 years, some companies in your space are going to be in great shape and some are going to be scrambling. Where do you honestly think you sit right now — closer to ready or closer to scrambling?"
- Why they'll answer: Ego appeal ("long enough to see"), binary choice forces an honest self-assessment, "honestly" signals you want the real answer not the polished one

**Q10** (Why now?)
- Add: Presupposition + emotional label + specificity
- New phrasing: "People don't take calls like this unless something changed. Something got worse, something broke, or you finally got fed up. What was the moment — what happened that made you say 'okay, I need to talk to someone about this'?"
- Why they'll answer: Presupposes a trigger exists (it does — they took the call), validates their frustration ("got fed up"), asks for a specific moment which bypasses generic answers

### Phase 2 (Q11-Q15): The 5 Questions Framework

**Q11 / Framework Q1** (Biggest problem)
- Add: Contrast + presupposition + micro-commitment
- New phrasing: "You've just walked me through a lot. Here's what I'm hearing — there are several things pulling at you. But I want to get specific: if you had to point at the ONE thing that's costing you the most — money, time, sanity, whatever — which one would you point at?"
- Why they'll answer: "You've just walked me through a lot" acknowledges their investment (sunk cost); "I want to get specific" is a mini-embedded command; "money, time, sanity, whatever" gives multiple categories so they can't say "I don't know"

**Q12 / Framework Q2** (Monthly cost)
- Add: Reciprocity + scaffolding + permission
- New phrasing: "I want to put a real number on this — not to be nosy, but because it helps both of us figure out if solving this is actually worth the investment. When you think about [restate problem in their words] — between the hours burned, the revenue left on the table, and the stuff that falls through the cracks — what does that add up to per month, roughly?"
- Why they'll answer: You explained WHY you're asking (reciprocity), used their own words (proof you listened), and gave them three categories to add up (scaffolding makes quantification easy), "roughly" removes pressure of precision

**Q13 / Framework Q3** (How long?)
- Add: Presupposition + emotional label + accumulation framing
- New phrasing: "Here's the part that usually stings a little. How long have you been living with this? Because if it's been [their monthly cost] for even six months, we're talking about [calculated figure] that's already gone."
- Why they'll answer: "Usually stings" pre-frames the emotional impact (they brace for it, which makes the realization hit harder); doing the math for them makes the accumulated cost concrete and undeniable

**Q14 / Framework Q4** (Cost of inaction)
- Add: Presupposition + silence + contrast
- New phrasing: "Let's say you and I never talk again. This call doesn't lead anywhere. You go back to Monday morning and everything stays exactly the same. Walk me through what the next 6 to 12 months looks like."
- Why they'll answer: Making it vivid and specific ("Monday morning") grounds it in reality; "never talk again" is a subtle takeaway that makes them not want that outcome; then silence — let them fill it with their own fears

**Q15 / Framework Q5** (Magic wand)
- Add: Emotional release + permission to dream + ego appeal
- New phrasing: "Okay, last one — and this is the fun one after all of that. Forget budgets, forget limitations, forget what's 'realistic.' If I could build you the perfect system that makes [their Q11 problem] disappear completely — what does your business look like on the other side? Paint me the picture."
- Why they'll answer: "The fun one" signals relief; "forget budgets/limitations/realistic" removes all filters; "paint me the picture" is an embedded command that invites storytelling, which people naturally enjoy

## Structural additions to the document

1. **Add a "Persuasion Cheat Sheet" section** at the top (after "How This Works") — a quick-reference table of all 11 techniques with one-line definitions so the caller can internalize them
2. **Add a "Why they'll answer" block** under each question (after the persuasion intent)
3. **Add "Alternate phrasings" block** under each question — 2-3 different angles using different techniques
4. **Update the "How This Works" intro** to emphasize that every question is engineered for compliance, not just information gathering

---

## What I will NOT change
- The 5-question framework names/labels (Q1-Q5 mapping)
- The listen-for signals (still relevant)
- The post-call reference table
- The companion document references
- The transition line between phases (will review for persuasion but keep the spirit)
