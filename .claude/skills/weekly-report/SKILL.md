# Weekly Report Generator Skill

## Purpose
Automate the generation of weekly progress reports by scanning all active project folders and extracting recent context including meetings, action items, status updates, and deliverables.

## When to Use This Skill
- End of week progress reporting
- Preparing client update summaries
- Team status sync
- When asked to "generate weekly report" or "/weekly-report"

## Workflow

### Step 1: Scan Active Projects

Scan the directory: `claude-code-os-implementation/02-operations/project-management/active-projects/`

For each subdirectory (excluding README.md files):
1. Identify as a project folder
2. Read the project README.md for overview

### Step 2: Extract Recent Content (Last 7 Days)

For each project, look for content from the last 7 days. Meeting folders follow the pattern: `YYYY-MM-DD-<description>/`

**Date Detection:**
- Parse folder names with regex: `^(\d{4})-(\d{2})-(\d{2})`
- Calculate cutoff date: today minus 7 days
- Include meetings where folder date >= cutoff date

**Content to Extract (in priority order):**

1. **Meetings** (`meetings/YYYY-MM-DD-*/`)
   - Read `summary.md` (preferred - already condensed)
   - Read `action-items.md` for open/completed items
   - Skip `transcript.md` (too verbose)

2. **Status** (`status/`)
   - Read most recent status file
   - Look for `P0-ACTIVE-NOW.md` or similar priority indicators

3. **Deliverables** (`deliverables/`)
   - Read `README.md` or `CHANGELOG.md`
   - Note recent milestones

4. **Discovery** (`discovery/`)
   - Read `DISCOVERY-FINDINGS.md` if updated recently
   - Note any new stakeholder interviews

### Step 3: Generate Report

Create a markdown report at:
`claude-code-os-implementation/02-operations/weekly-reports/weekly-report-YYYY-MM-DD.md`

**Report Structure:**

```markdown
# Weekly Report - [DATE]

**Generated:** [TIMESTAMP]
**Period:** [START_DATE] to [END_DATE]
**Active Projects:** [COUNT]

---

## Executive Summary
[2-3 sentence overview synthesizing progress across all projects]

---

## Project Reports

### [PROJECT_NAME] ([PRIORITY])
**Client:** [CLIENT_NAME] | **Status:** [PHASE] | **Investment:** [AMOUNT]

#### Recent Meetings ([COUNT])
| Date | Summary |
|------|---------|
| [DATE] | [KEY_POINTS] |

#### Action Items

**Open:**
- [ ] [ITEM] | Owner: [OWNER] | Priority: [P0/P1/P2]

**Completed:**
- [x] [ITEM]

#### Deliverables Update
[Brief status of recent deliverables]

#### Notes
[Any discovery findings or important updates]

---

[REPEAT FOR EACH PROJECT]

---

## Aggregate Metrics

| Metric | This Week |
|--------|-----------|
| Total Meetings | [X] |
| Open Action Items | [X] |
| Completed Action Items | [X] |
| Active Projects | [X] |

---

## Next Week Focus
1. [TOP_PRIORITY_1]
2. [TOP_PRIORITY_2]
3. [TOP_PRIORITY_3]

---

*Generated by weekly-report skill*
```

### Step 4: Send Slack Summary

After generating the report file, post a condensed summary to Slack.

**Slack Message Format:**
```
:clipboard: *Weekly Report - [DATE]*

*Active Projects:* [COUNT]
*Total Meetings:* [COUNT]

:fire: *[PROJECT_1] (P0)*
- Phase: [PHASE]
- Meetings: [X] this week
- Key: [ONE_LINE_SUMMARY]

:construction: *[PROJECT_2] (P1)*
- Phase: [PHASE]
- Meetings: [X] this week
- Key: [ONE_LINE_SUMMARY]

Full report saved to: weekly-reports/weekly-report-[DATE].md
```

Use the Slack skill or `agentic/modules/slack/` to post the message.

## Project Priority Detection

Determine project priority from:
1. `status/P0-ACTIVE-NOW.md` file existence
2. README.md mentions of "P0", "P1", "P2"
3. `audit/opportunity-matrix.md` priority indicators
4. Default to "Active" if no priority found

Order projects in report: P0 first, then P1, then P2, then others.

## Action Item Parsing

Action items typically appear in markdown tables or checkbox lists:

**Table format:**
```
| Priority | Task | Owner | Status |
|----------|------|-------|--------|
| P0 | [Task description] | [Name] | Pending |
```

**List format:**
```
- [ ] [Task description] | Owner: [Name]
- [x] [Completed task]
```

Extract:
- Task description
- Owner (if specified)
- Priority (if specified)
- Status (open/completed based on checkbox)

## Error Handling

| Scenario | Action |
|----------|--------|
| Missing README.md | Use folder name as project name, note "No overview available" |
| No meetings folder | Display "No meetings this period" |
| No recent meetings | Display "No recent meetings (last activity: [DATE])" |
| Missing status folder | Display "Status: Unknown" |
| Date parsing fails | Use file modification time as fallback |
| Empty project folder | Skip project, log warning |
| Slack post fails | Complete report generation, display error message |

## Output Locations

- **Report file:** `claude-code-os-implementation/02-operations/weekly-reports/weekly-report-YYYY-MM-DD.md`
- **Slack channel:** Use default configured channel or prompt user

## Example Execution

When user says "/weekly-report":

1. Read all projects in active-projects/
2. For today (2026-01-15), cutoff is 2026-01-08
3. Find meetings from 2026-01-08 to 2026-01-15
4. Extract summaries and action items
5. Generate report file
6. Post Slack summary
7. Report completion to user

## Tips

- Run this skill Friday afternoon or Monday morning
- Review generated report before sharing externally
- Add manual "Next Week Focus" items if auto-generated ones are insufficient
- The skill reads existing content - it does not create meeting notes or status updates
