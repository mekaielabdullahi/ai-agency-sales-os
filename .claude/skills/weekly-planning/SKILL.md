# Weekly Planning Skill

## Purpose
Strategic weekly planning framework for AI agency sales operations, optimized for systematic growth and revenue generation.

## When to Use This Skill
- Planning a new week (Sunday evening or Monday morning)
- Reviewing completed week performance
- Creating detailed weekly roadmaps
- Setting strategic weekly objectives
- Aligning weekly activities with OBG (One Big Goal)

## Weekly Planning Framework

### 1. Strategic Context Setting
**Questions to Answer**:
- What is THE ONE THING for this week?
- How does this week advance the OBG (Scale AriseGroup.ai to sustainable revenue)?
- What's the week number and phase in overall roadmap?
- What did last week accomplish?

**Output**:
```
Week Number: [X] of 2025
Phase: [Foundation/Validation/Deployment/Growth]
Primary Focus: [Clear one-sentence focus]
THE ONE THING: [Single most important outcome]
```

### 2. Success Definition
Define clear, measurable success criteria:

**Template**:
```
By end of week, you will have:
- ✅ [Specific deliverable 1]
- ✅ [Specific deliverable 2]
- ✅ [Specific deliverable 3]
- ✅ [Key metric: target value]
- ✅ [Strategic progress indicator]
```

### 3. Weekly Themes
Create 2-4 themes that organize the week:

**Example Structure**:
- **Theme 1**: [Focus area] (Which days, What goal, Success metric)
- **Theme 2**: [Focus area] (Which days, What goal, Success metric)
- **Theme 3**: [Focus area] (Which days, What goal, Success metric)

### 4. Daily Breakdown
For each day of the week (Monday-Friday):

**Daily Template**:
```
## [DAY], [DATE]: [DAILY THEME]

### THE ONE THING: [Single daily objective]

### Morning Session (8:00 AM - 12:00 PM) - 4 hours
**Energy Level**: Peak/High/Medium
**Primary Goal**: [What to accomplish]

#### Time Blocks:
8:00-9:00 AM | [Task] (60 min)
9:00-10:30 AM | [Task] (90 min)
10:30-10:45 AM | BREAK (15 min)
10:45-12:00 PM | [Task] (75 min)

### Afternoon Session (2:00 PM - 5:00 PM) - 3 hours
**Energy Level**: Medium/Lower
**Primary Goal**: [What to accomplish]

#### Time Blocks:
2:00-3:30 PM | [Task] (90 min)
3:30-5:00 PM | [Task] (90 min)

### Evening Wrap-Up (5:00-5:30 PM)
- Daily productivity assessment
- Score the day (1-10)
- Plan tomorrow's ONE THING

### [Day] Success Metrics:
- ✅ [Specific deliverable]
- ✅ [Metric target]
- ✅ Productivity: [X]+/10
```

### 5. Weekly Success Scorecard
Create trackable metrics:

**Template**:
```
### Primary Deliverables (Must Complete)
- [ ] [Major deliverable 1]
- [ ] [Major deliverable 2]
- [ ] [Major deliverable 3]

### Productivity Metrics
- [ ] Daily scores: Mon ___ Tue ___ Wed ___ Thu ___ Fri ___
- [ ] Weekly average: _____ / 10 (target: 7.5+)
- [ ] Tier 1 completion rate: _____% (target: 80%+)

### Strategic Validation
- [ ] [Strategic outcome 1]
- [ ] [Strategic outcome 2]
```

### 6. Kill List - DO NOT DO
Critical for maintaining focus:

**Template**:
```
### What to Avoid This Week
❌ [Common distraction 1]
❌ [Scope creep example]
❌ [Energy drain activity]
❌ [Strategic drift pattern]
```

### 7. Energy Management Strategy
Plan for sustainable execution:

**Daily Energy Allocation**:
- **Peak Energy (Mornings)**: [Type of work]
- **Medium Energy (Early Afternoons)**: [Type of work]
- **Lower Energy (Late Afternoons)**: [Type of work]

**Energy Preservation Tactics**:
- Breaks every 90-120 min
- Context switching minimization
- Momentum maintenance strategies

## Output Structure

A complete weekly plan includes:
1. **Strategic Overview** (1 page)
   - Week context
   - THE ONE THING
   - Success definition
   - Weekly themes

2. **Daily Breakdowns** (5 days × 1-2 pages each)
   - Each day with hour-by-hour detail
   - Morning/afternoon sessions
   - Success metrics

3. **Support Sections**
   - Weekly scorecard
   - Kill list
   - Energy management
   - Celebration milestones
   - Integration with existing systems

## Best Practices

### Time Allocation
- **Planning time**: 60-90 minutes for full week plan
- **Daily reviews**: 5 minutes each evening
- **Mid-week check**: 15 minutes Wednesday
- **Weekly review**: 60 minutes Friday afternoon

### Strategic Alignment Check
Every task should answer: "How does this advance the OBG?"
- If it doesn't → Question it or cut it
- If it does → Prioritize it

### Realistic Capacity
- **Deep work blocks**: 2-3 hours max per session
- **Breaks**: Every 90-120 minutes
- **Daily capacity**: 6-7 hours productive work
- **Weekly capacity**: 30-35 hours (not 60+)

### Brutal Prioritization
- Tier 1 tasks: Must complete (20% of tasks, 80% of impact)
- Tier 2 tasks: Should complete
- Tier 3 tasks: Nice to have
- Focus on Tier 1 ONLY until complete

## Common Patterns by Week Type

### Build Week
Focus: Creating systems, infrastructure, foundational work
Theme balance: 70% building, 20% testing, 10% content

### Validation Week
Focus: Testing systems, gathering data, refining
Theme balance: 50% testing, 30% refinement, 20% documentation

### Deployment Week
Focus: Client work, revenue activities, market engagement
Theme balance: 60% client work, 30% delivery, 10% content

### Growth Week
Focus: Scaling, optimization, team building
Theme balance: 40% scaling, 40% optimization, 20% documentation

## Examples

### Example 1: Client Deployment Week
```
Week 3: December 9-13, 2025
Phase: Deployment & Revenue Generation
THE ONE THING: Deploy client-ready assets and initiate first revenue-generating conversations

Success:
- 60-80 outreach messages sent
- 2-3 discovery calls completed
- $5K-20K revenue pipeline

Themes:
- Client Outreach (Mon, Tue, Thu)
- Value Delivery (Wed)
- Conversion Focus (Fri)
```

### Example 2: System Validation Week
```

- Client Assets (Tue, Thu)
- Template Extraction (Thu)
```

## Integration with Other Systems

### Connects With:
- **Executive Office**: Daily planning agents use weekly plan
- **Operations**: Productivity tracking aligned with weekly metrics
- **Content Team**: Weekly content calendar integration
- **AI Growth Engine**: Strategic alignment verification

### Feeds Into:
- Daily roadmap generation (from weekly breakdown)
- Monthly reviews (aggregate weekly data)
- OBG tracking (weekly contribution assessment)

## Success Indicators

A good weekly plan has:
- ✅ Clear ONE THING (everyone knows the priority)
- ✅ Realistic capacity (not overwhelming)
- ✅ Strategic alignment (serves OBG)
- ✅ Measurable outcomes (can track success)
- ✅ Energy management (sustainable pace)
- ✅ Kill list (knows what to avoid)

## Tips for Effective Weekly Planning

1. **Plan Sunday evening or Monday 8am** - Fresh start with clear direction
2. **Review Friday afternoon** - Assess week, plan next week
3. **Time-box planning** - 90 minutes max, don't perfect it forever
4. **Use templates** - Don't reinvent structure each week
5. **Link to OBG** - Every week should advance the main goal
6. **Celebrate wins** - Note achievements, not just tasks
7. **Learn from data** - Use productivity scores to improve

## Troubleshooting

**If week feels overwhelming**:
- Reduce scope (brutal prioritization)
- Focus on THE ONE THING only
- Extend timeline if needed

**If week feels too easy**:
- You're probably underestimating time
- Add stretch goal (bonus tier)
- But don't overfill - margin is good

**If losing strategic alignment**:
- Review OBG explicitly
- Cut anything that doesn't serve it
- Simplify themes

**If productivity drops mid-week**:
- Check energy management
- Review kill list compliance
- Adjust Thursday/Friday load
