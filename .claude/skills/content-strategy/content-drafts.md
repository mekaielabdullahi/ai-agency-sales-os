### Draft 1: Plotter Mechanix N8N Integration (Development Pillar)

**Status:** Draft
**Pillar:** Development
**Type:** Case Study
**Source:** Notion - Plotter Mechanix Phase 1

---

We just deployed an N8N integration for a client.

Weekend deployment. Production system. Real customer data.

Here's how we de-risked it:

THE CHALLENGE:
Client's quoting tool (Quo) didn't talk to their job management system (Jobber).

Manual data entry between systems.
Duplicate contacts.
Missed follow-ups.

THE SOLUTION:
Built an N8N workflow that:
→ Syncs quotes to jobs automatically
→ Matches contacts (prioritizing existing Jobber records)
→ Creates tasks for edge cases

THE DEPLOYMENT APPROACH:

We don't ship automations without a safety net.

Step 1: Demo with real data (not test accounts)
Step 2: Define rollback triggers
Step 3: Weekend deployment (low traffic)
Step 4: SOP documentation before go-live

THE RESULT:
Integration approved and deployed.
Rollback plan defined but never needed.
4+ hours/week of manual work eliminated.

THE LESSON:
Automation isn't about speed to deploy.

It's about confidence when you deploy.

A rollback plan isn't pessimism - it's professionalism.

### Draft 2: Wolf Sheds PRD Scoping (Consulting Pillar)

**Status:** Draft
**Pillar:** Consulting
**Type:** Case Study / Framework
**Source:** Notion - SS_Wolf_Sheds_PRD_Phase1

---

We just scoped an AI project for a shed company.

Not a tech startup. Not a SaaS company.
A service business that installs sheds.

Here's what the discovery revealed:

THE SITUATION:
→ Quotes going out manually
→ Job scheduling in one system, invoicing in another
→ Follow-ups falling through the cracks
→ Owner spending hours on admin instead of sales

THE SCOPING PROCESS:

**Step 1: Workflow Mapping**
Walked through a real customer journey.
Quote → Scheduling → Install → Invoice → Follow-up.
Found 4 handoff points where data gets re-entered manually.

**Step 2: Pain Point Prioritization**
Not everything needs automation.
Focused on: What costs the most time? What causes the most errors?
Answer: Quote-to-job handoff and post-install follow-ups.

**Step 3: Success Metrics**
Defined before building anything:
→ 3+ hours/week reclaimed from manual entry
→ Zero missed follow-ups
→ Quotes and jobs synced automatically

THE LESSON:

Service businesses don't need "AI transformation."

They need their systems to stop fighting each other.

A good PRD makes the solution obvious before you write a line of code.
