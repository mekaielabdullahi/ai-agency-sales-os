## 2. LinkedIn Post Structure

### The Hook (Line 1)

**Purpose**: Stop the scroll in first 1-2 lines

**Hook Formulas**:

**1. Curiosity Gap**
```
Built an agent factory over the weekend.
Today's the real test: does it actually work?
```

**2. Contrarian Statement**
```
Most people build AI agents manually.
I built a factory to build them automatically.
```

**3. Bold Declaration**
```
Reduced my daily planning from 30 minutes to 60 seconds.
Here's the system:
```

**4. Specific Promise**
```
3 weeks ago: No AI system.
Today: Fully automated operations.
Here's what changed:
```

**5. Pattern Interrupt**
```
Day 7 of building in public.
The system that creates systems is working.
```

**6. Problem Statement**
```
You're incredibly productive on the wrong priorities.
That's the nightmare.
```

**Hook Quality Checklist**:
- [ ] 1-2 lines maximum
- [ ] Specific (not vague)
- [ ] Creates curiosity or tension
- [ ] Relevant to target audience
- [ ] No jargon or buzzwords
- [ ] Strong enough to stop scroll

### The Body (Main Content)

**Structure**:
1. **Context/Setup** (2-3 lines): Why this matters
2. **Main Content** (organized with bullets/arrows): The meat
3. **Key Insight** (1-2 lines): The lesson or takeaway

**Formatting Best Practices**:
- Line breaks every 1-2 sentences
- Use → or • for lists
- CAPS for section headers
- Numbers for data points
- Short paragraphs (2-3 lines max)

**Example**:
```
THE PROBLEM:
30 minutes every morning just figuring out what to work on.

Peak energy gone before real work starts.

THE SOLUTION:
I built an AI-powered planning system.

It handles:
→ Daily planning (60 seconds, not 30 minutes)
→ Objective productivity tracking (data, not feelings)
→ Pattern recognition (what's working vs what's not)

THE VALUE:
My mornings back. Clear priorities. Real feedback.
```

### The CTA (Call to Action)

**Purpose**: Clear next step for readers

**CTA Types**:

**1. Engagement CTA**
```
Following the build? Drop a comment.
```

**2. Value CTA**
```
Want systematic AI adoption for your org? → AriseGroup.ai
```

**3. Question CTA**
```
What's your biggest AI adoption challenge?
```

**4. Series CTA**
```
Part 1/3 - Tomorrow I'll share the results.
```

**5. Resource CTA**
```
Free AI Readiness Audit → AriseGroup.ai
```

### Hashtags

**Strategy**: 4-6 relevant hashtags

**Core Hashtags**:
- #AIAdoption
- #AITransformation
- #BuildInPublic
- #SystematicGrowth
- #Productivity

**Rotate**:
- #AriseGroupAI

## 10. Build-in-Public Best Practices

- ❌ Share vague claims without data
- ❌ Cherry-pick only wins
- ❌ Ignore feedback or criticism

### Strategic Messaging

**Core Messages to Reinforce**:
1. Systematic > Manual (AI adoption needs framework)

**AriseGroup.ai Positioning**:
- Expertise in systematic AI adoption
- Framework-based (not ad-hoc)
