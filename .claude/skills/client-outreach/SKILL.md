Hi [Name],

I noticed [specific observation about their company/post/challenge].

Many [their role] in [industry] are exploring AI but struggling with systematic adoption—lots of tools, no cohesive strategy.

I specialize in helping companies like [their company] create AI operating systems that:

→ Scale systematically (not ad-hoc tool adoption)

I'd like to offer a free AI Readiness Audit—30-minute conversation where I map your operations to specific AI opportunities. No sales pitch, just actionable framework.

Interested in exploring this week?

Best,
[Your Name]
Founder, AriseGroup.ai

## 7. Pipeline Tracking

## 8. Best Practices

### Quality Over Quantity
- 10 highly personalized messages > 50 generic ones
- Better: 15 messages/day (personalized) than 100/day (templated)
- Focus on ICP fit, not just volume

### Multi-Channel Strategy
- **LinkedIn**: Primary channel (warm, professional)
- **Email**: Follow-up and detailed communication
- **Engagement**: Comment on their posts before outreach
- **Referrals**: Ask existing network for intros

### Timing Optimization
- **Best days**: Tuesday-Thursday
- **Best times**: 9-11 AM, 2-4 PM (local time)
- **Follow-up cadence**: Day 1, Day 3, Day 7, Day 14

### Objection Handling

**"We're not ready for AI"**:
→ "That's exactly why the audit is valuable—it shows you where to start small. Most companies start with one 30-day project, not full transformation."

**"We tried AI tools, didn't work"**:
→ "That's common with point solutions. The difference is systematic adoption—framework that integrates tools with your actual workflow."

**"Too expensive"**:
→ "The audit is free, zero commitment. Let's see if there's fit before discussing investment."

**"Need to think about it"**:
→ "Absolutely. What specific questions can I answer to help your decision?"

### Red Flags (Disqualify)
- ❌ Budget under $3K (too small)
- ❌ Looking for single tool recommendation (not strategic)
- ❌ "Just send me pricing" (not consultative fit)
- ❌ Unrealistic timeline (want everything in 2 weeks)
- ❌ No decision-making authority
