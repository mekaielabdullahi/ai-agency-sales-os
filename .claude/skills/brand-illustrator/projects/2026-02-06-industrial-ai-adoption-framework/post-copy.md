## HOOK OPTIONS

### Hook A: The Data Hook (RECOMMENDED)
```
Industrial service companies lose 20+ hours a week to coordination.
Not to bad work. To the gaps between good work.
```
- Clarity: 9/10 -- Immediately specific to industrial/field service audience
- Curiosity: 8/10 -- "Gaps between good work" creates tension and reframes the problem
- Relevance: 9/10 -- Directly speaks to ops pain at $5-25M companies

### Hook B: The Contrarian Hook
```
Your best technicians are your biggest bottleneck.
That's not a people problem. It's a systems problem.
```
- Clarity: 8/10 -- Clear contrast but requires the body to pay off
- Curiosity: 9/10 -- Provocative; challenges an assumption owners hold
- Relevance: 8/10 -- Strong for companies with skilled field teams

### Hook C: The Question Hook
```
How many phone calls does it take to get one technician to one job site?
For most industrial service companies, the answer is embarrassing.
```
- Clarity: 8/10 -- Concrete question that lands immediately
- Curiosity: 7/10 -- "Embarrassing" adds tension but slightly softer
- Relevance: 9/10 -- Dispatch pain is universal in this vertical

## FINAL POST (Using Hook A)

```
Industrial service companies lose 20+ hours a week to coordination.
Not to bad work. To the gaps between good work.

We keep seeing the same pattern across $5-10M industrial and field service companies.

Great technicians. Strong reputation. Growing demand.
But the backoffice can't keep up.

THE 4 HIDDEN TIME DRAINS:

1. Quote-to-project handoff
Every quote that converts requires re-entering the same data into a different system.
Scope details. Customer specs. Timelines. All typed again.
That's 30-45 minutes per project that adds zero value.

2. Technician dispatch and routing
Who's closest? Who has the right certs? Who's finishing early?
Most companies answer these questions with phone calls and gut feel.
Every wrong answer costs a truck roll.

3. Service call triage
A customer calls with an issue. It goes to whoever answers.
That person writes it down, maybe emails someone, maybe forgets.
No prioritization. No routing logic. No tracking.

4. Project status visibility
The owner knows where every job stands -- because the owner asked.
Nobody else has the full picture.
That's not leadership. That's a bottleneck.

THE PATTERN:
These four drains share one root cause.
Information lives in people's heads instead of in systems.

THE FIX:
You don't need to automate everything at once.

Start with the handoff that costs you the most time.
Map it. Measure it. Then systematize it.

The companies that figure this out at $5M don't hit a wall at $10M.

## VISUAL CONCEPT

**Concept: The 4 Drain Points**

Isometric view of an industrial service operation with four glowing friction points:
- Quote desk with paper trail flowing to separate system (drain 1)
- Dispatch board with scattered pins and phone calls (drain 2)
- Incoming call with branching, disconnected paths (drain 3)
- Owner figure at center with all information lines converging (drain 4)

Warm Tech style: cream background, amber-gold-teal accent on the drain points, clean geometric figures.
