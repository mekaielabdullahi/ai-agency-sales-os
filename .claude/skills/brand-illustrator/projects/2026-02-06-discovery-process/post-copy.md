## FINAL POST

```
Kelsey didn't come to us with a $180,000 problem.

He came to us with a phone system question.

"Can you help me track my calls better?"

That was the ask.

Here's what we actually found:

THE SURFACE PROBLEM:
→ Calls weren't being logged
→ Customer info getting lost
→ Manual entry eating time

We could have stopped there.
Built a phone system. Called it done.

But we kept asking:

"Why is Joe calling you mid-job?"
"Where does your repair knowledge live?"
"What happens when you're sick?"

THE REAL PROBLEM:
Kelsey is the business.

Every decision. Every fix. Every answer.
All in his head.

Joe can't perform at full capacity because he can't access what Kelsey knows.
That's not a phone problem.
That's a $180,000/year knowledge problem.

THE LESSON:
The problem your client describes is rarely the problem.

It's a symptom.

Your job isn't to fix what they ask for.
It's to find what they can't see.

Most consultants build what's requested.
The good ones dig until they find what matters.

What's the real problem hiding behind the surface ask?
