# Discovery Process - Image Prompt

**Project:** 2026-02-06-discovery-process
**Concept:** Surface vs. Deep Problem Discovery
**Format:** LinkedIn Square (1080 x 1080)

## Full Prompt

Create a warm tech illustration in isometric perspective showing the discovery process - finding the real problem beneath the surface.

**VISUAL CONCEPT:**
A layered depth visualization showing discovery from top to bottom.

**TOP LAYER (Surface Problem):**
Simple icons floating at the surface - a phone, scattered notes, a clock. These represent the "easy ask" - the symptom. Light, semi-transparent, almost faded. Small question mark bubbles.

**MIDDLE LAYER (The Dig):**
A magnifying glass or discovery lens with the Arise Glow gradient (amber → gold → soft teal) illuminating downward. Question mark icons transforming into insight sparks. Visual of "peeling back" or "looking deeper."

**BOTTOM LAYER (The Real Problem):**
The core insight revealed - a glowing brain/knowledge icon connected to a single figure, with blocked pathways to other figures. This represents "knowledge trapped in one person." Brighter, more saturated, clearly the focal point. Dollar signs or value indicators showing the real impact.

**FLOW:**
Downward discovery motion - from surface (faded, simple) to depth (bright, complex, valuable). Arrows or light beams guiding the eye down.

**Style:** Sophisticated and detailed but human and approachable - like Linear meets Stripe meets Notion but warmer. Precise, clean line work. Soft, diffused shadows. Detailed but not cluttered. Premium digital illustration quality. Warm and inviting atmosphere.

**Colors:**
- Primary accent: Warm amber (#E8914F) and gold (#F5C26B)
- Secondary accent: Soft teal (#2D7D8A)
- Background: Soft cream (#FDF8F3)
- Structure/outlines: Deep navy (#1A2B4A)
- Use amber-gold-teal gradient for the discovery lens and insight highlights
- Top layer: Faded/muted tones
- Bottom layer: Full saturation, glowing

**Composition:** Top-to-bottom discovery flow. Clear visual distinction between surface (simple, faded) and depth (complex, bright, valuable). The discovery lens in the middle is the action moment. Include subtle directional cues guiding the eye through the layers.

**Format:** 1080 x 1080 pixels, square aspect ratio for LinkedIn.

**Quality:** High resolution, crisp details, clean edges on all elements, consistent warm lighting throughout, professional polished finish.

**Do NOT include:** Cold blue colors, pure white or pure black, harsh shadows, photorealistic elements, stock photo aesthetic, cluttered or chaotic compositions, cartoonish style, rough textures, dark atmosphere, cool gray tones, text or words.

## Condensed Prompt (for Pollinations / Microsoft Designer / Napkin.ai)

Warm tech isometric illustration showing discovery process as layers from top to bottom. Top layer: faded simple icons (phone, notes, clock) representing surface problem. Middle: glowing amber-gold-teal magnifying glass or discovery lens looking deeper, question marks becoming insight sparks. Bottom layer: bright revealed core - glowing brain/knowledge icon connected to single figure with blocked pathways to others, dollar signs showing real value. Downward discovery flow, arrows guiding eye. Soft cream background, warm amber gold teal color palette, deep navy outlines, top layer faded/muted, bottom layer full saturation and glowing. Professional digital illustration, Linear meets Stripe aesthetic but warmer. No cold blues, no text, no harsh shadows.

## Napkin.ai Text Input

```
The Discovery Process

SURFACE (what they asked):
- Track calls better
- Log customer info
- Reduce manual entry

DEEPER (what we found):
- Knowledge trapped in owner's head
- Employee can't access expertise
- $180,000/year problem

THE LESSON:
Surface problem ≠ Real problem
Symptoms ≠ Root cause
```
