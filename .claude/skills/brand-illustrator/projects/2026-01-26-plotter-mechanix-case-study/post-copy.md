## COPY A: The Raw Testimonial (Most Authentic)

```
"This is so beneficial to me. I make a phone call, and I don't have to make ANOTHER phone call to explain what the first one was about."

That's Kelsey, owner of a printer repair business in Phoenix.

10 days ago, every customer call meant:
→ Scribbled notes on paper
→ Trying to remember details later
→ Manually entering everything into their CRM
→ Alyssa (office manager) chasing down info

Today:
→ Every call auto-transcribes
→ AI extracts customer name, what they need, service type
→ Opportunity created in Jobber automatically
→ Alyssa gets organized summaries instead of scattered notes

The tech? AI phone system + CRM integration.
The result? 5 new leads referred to us this week.

He said: "Once you guys get me set up, I wanna be an outside sales rep for you."

That's the kind of feedback that makes this work worth it.

What manual process is eating your team's time?

```

**Why this works:** Raw testimonial as hook, specific transformation, social proof (referrals), ends with engagement question.

## COPY B: The Contrast (Before/After Focus)

```
Before AI phone system:
→ Customer calls come in
→ Grab a pen, scribble notes
→ Finish the call, get distracted
→ 3 hours later: "What did they need again?"
→ Manually type everything into CRM
→ Office manager chases missing details

After AI phone system:
→ Customer calls come in
→ Call auto-transcribes in real-time
→ AI extracts: name, company, service needed, supplies requested
→ CRM entry created automatically
→ Office manager gets clean summary

We just built this for a printer repair business.

Their reaction: "This is getting ridiculous. So beneficial."

10 days from kickoff to working system.
No complex training.
No expensive enterprise software.

Just calls that turn into organized data.

What would your team do with all that time back?

#ServiceBusinessAutomation #AIForSMB #WorkflowAutomation #AriseWithAI
```

**Why this works:** Clear visual contrast, specific outcomes, timeline proof (10 days), low-friction positioning.

## COPY C: The Build-in-Public Story (Shorter)

```
Building in public: Week 2 of our printer repair AI project.

What we did:
→ Ported 2 phone lines to AI phone system
→ Built call transcription + extraction
→ Connected to their CRM (Jobber)

What the client said:
"I make a phone call and don't have to make another call to explain what it was about. Thank you man."

What happened next:
He referred us 5 new leads in 7 days.

That's the flywheel.
Deliver real value → Client becomes advocate.

More updates coming as we roll out Phase 2.

Who else is building in public?

```

**Why this works:** Build-in-public authenticity, concise, invites community engagement.

## COPY D: The Numbers Story (ROI Focus)

```
How much time does your team spend logging phone calls?

For one printer repair business in Phoenix:
→ 15-20 calls per day
→ ~5 minutes each to log properly
→ That's 8+ hours per week on data entry

We built them an AI phone system in 10 days.

Now:
→ Every call transcribes automatically
→ AI extracts customer info, service type, supplies needed
→ CRM entry created with zero manual work

Their office manager went from chasing details to having organized summaries.

Client's words: "This is so beneficial."

8 hours/week back.
Zero training required.
Already referring new clients.

That's what AI should do for small businesses.

What's your team's biggest time sink?
