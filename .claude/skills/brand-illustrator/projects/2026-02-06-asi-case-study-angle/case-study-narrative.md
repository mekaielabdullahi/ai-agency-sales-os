# ASI Case Study Angle (Prospective)

**Status:** Pre-engagement -- narrative framework for if/when ASI becomes a client
**Company Profile:** $7.1M industrial automation, 32 employees, robotics/controls/PLC programming
**President:** Brad Tompkins
**Location:** Birmingham, AL
**Tagline:** "Our Passion Is Your Productivity"

## CASE STUDY HEADLINE OPTIONS

### Headline A (RECOMMENDED)
**"How a $7M Industrial Automation Company Systematized Operations Without Slowing Down"**
- Why: Speaks to the core tension -- growing companies fear that adding systems will create bureaucracy. This headline promises the opposite.

### Headline B
**"From 32 Technicians and Zero Systems to AI-Powered Operations: One Industrial Company's Transformation"**
- Why: Specific numbers, clear before/after arc. Slightly longer but more descriptive.

### Headline C
**"The Coordination Problem That Was Costing an Industrial Service Company $200K+ a Year"**
- Why: Leads with quantified pain. Strong for ROI-focused audiences. Requires the cost estimate to be validated during engagement.

## STORY ARC

### Act 1: The Growth That Created the Problem
- ASI grew to $7.1M on technical excellence -- robotics, controls, PLC programming
- 32 employees across operations, but operational infrastructure didn't scale with revenue
- Brad Tompkins built the company on craft and reputation
- The same qualities that drove growth (hands-on, detail-oriented, involved in everything) became the bottleneck

**Key narrative beat:** The company's strength became its constraint. Brad's deep involvement in every project, quote, and dispatch decision meant the business couldn't operate without him in the loop.

### Act 2: The Discovery -- Where Time Actually Goes
- AriseGroup AI audit reveals the real cost of manual coordination
- Four critical handoff points identified:
  1. **Quote generation:** Every proposal requires Brad or a senior engineer to recall project specs, pricing history, and customer context from memory. No centralized quoting system.
  2. **Project management:** Status updates happen via text, hallway conversations, and Brad asking. No single source of truth for where each project stands.
  3. **Technician dispatch:** Routing decisions based on who Brad thinks is available, not real-time data. Wrong dispatches cost truck rolls and customer wait time.
  4. **Service call triage:** Incoming service requests handled by whoever answers. No prioritization logic. No routing to the right technician based on skill set or location.

**Key narrative beat:** The audit doesn't surface surprising problems -- it quantifies problems Brad already knows about. The value is in the measurement, not the discovery.

### Act 3: The Systematic Fix (Phased)
- Phase 1: Systematize the highest-cost handoff first (likely quote-to-project or dispatch)
- Phase 2: Build on Phase 1 with connected workflows
- Phase 3: Knowledge capture and operational intelligence

**Key narrative beat:** No "big bang" transformation. One handoff at a time. Each phase delivers measurable value before the next begins.

### Act 4: The Results
- Quantified time savings
- Operational capacity unlocked (Brad's hours redirected to growth)
- Team capability improvement (new hires productive faster)
- Revenue capacity increase without proportional headcount increase

**Key narrative beat:** The company didn't just get more efficient. It got more scalable. The systems created capacity for the next $7M without doubling the team.

## KEY METRICS TO TRACK

### Operational Metrics (Track from Day 1)

| Metric | Baseline (Pre-AI) | Target | Why It Matters |
|--------|-------------------|--------|----------------|
| Time to generate a quote | Measure in hours/days | 50%+ reduction | Direct revenue acceleration |
| Quote accuracy / revision rate | % of quotes requiring revision | 30%+ reduction | Fewer errors = faster close |
| Technician dispatch time | Minutes from request to dispatch | 70%+ reduction | Faster response = happier customers |
| Wrong dispatches per month | Count of re-routes or wrong-skill sends | 80%+ reduction | Each wrong dispatch = wasted truck roll |
| Service call response time | Time from call to assigned technician | 60%+ reduction | Customer satisfaction driver |
| Owner hours on coordination | Brad's weekly hours on dispatch/status/quoting | 50%+ reduction | The headline metric -- unlocked leadership capacity |
| Project status update time | How long it takes to get a full picture | From hours to seconds | Single source of truth |
| New hire ramp time | Months to productive | 30%+ reduction | Knowledge capture payoff |

### Business Impact Metrics (Track over 6-12 months)

| Metric | What to Measure | Why It Matters |
|--------|----------------|----------------|
| Revenue per employee | Total revenue / headcount | Scaling efficiency |
| Project throughput | Projects completed per quarter | Capacity increase |
| Customer satisfaction | NPS or repeat business rate | Service quality |
| Bid-to-win ratio | Quotes won / quotes sent | Faster, more accurate quotes should improve win rate |
| Brad's time allocation | % of time on growth vs. coordination | The transformation metric |

- Discovery process and findings
- Anonymized -- "an industrial automation company in the Southeast"

**Post 3 (Development):** "Phase 1 results: What changed in 30 days"
- Build-in-public with real metrics
- Client permission required before publishing

### Long-Form Case Study

**Format:** Before / Discovery / Implementation / Results
**Length:** 800-1200 words
**Distribution:** AriseGroup.ai website, LinkedIn article, email to prospects

### Video Testimonial Angle

**If Brad is willing:**
- 2-3 minute video
- Key quote to capture: His version of "I built this to $7M and then became the bottleneck"
- Before/after demonstration of one workflow

## IDEAL CLIENT PROFILE MATCH

This case study, once complete, serves as a magnet for:

| Attribute | ASI Profile | ICP Match |
|-----------|-------------|-----------|
| Revenue | $7.1M | $5-15M sweet spot |
| Employees | 32 | 20-50 range |
| Industry | Industrial automation | Manufacturing, field service, trades |
| Pain | Coordination at scale | Universal at this size |
| Decision maker | President/Owner | Owner-operator profile |
| Technical comfort | High (they build automation for others) | Removes "AI is scary" objection |

**Unique angle:** ASI builds automation for their customers. The case study narrative becomes: "Even automation companies need to automate their own operations." This is a powerful irony that makes the story memorable and shareable.
