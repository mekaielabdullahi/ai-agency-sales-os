## HOOK OPTIONS

### Hook A: The Bold Declaration (RECOMMENDED)
```
Every $5-10M company hits the same wall.
Revenue keeps climbing. Operations start cracking.
```
- Clarity: 9/10 -- Immediately names the audience and the problem
- Curiosity: 9/10 -- "Cracking" implies urgency; reader wants to know if it applies to them
- Relevance: 9/10 -- Directly calls out the revenue band most likely to feel this pain

### Hook B: The Pattern Hook
```
We've talked to a dozen companies between $5M and $10M this year.
Every single one described the same problem.
```
- Clarity: 8/10 -- Sets up authority through pattern recognition
- Curiosity: 8/10 -- "Every single one" and "same problem" create strong pull
- Relevance: 8/10 -- Positions AriseGroup as experienced in this segment

### Hook C: The Story Hook
```
A company president told me last month:
"I built this business to $7 million. Now I spend my day answering questions."
```
- Clarity: 9/10 -- Immediately relatable quote
- Curiosity: 7/10 -- Good but slightly less tension than Hook A
- Relevance: 9/10 -- Owner-operators will see themselves in this

## FINAL POST (Using Hook A)

```
Every $5-10M company hits the same wall.
Revenue keeps climbing. Operations start cracking.

Here's what we keep seeing across industrial service and field companies in that range.

THE SITUATION:
The company grew because the founder is excellent at the work.
Robotics. Controls. Electrical. Whatever the craft is.

They built the team to 25, 30, 40 people.
The work is good. Customers are happy. Revenue is real.

But here's what's happening underneath:

THE CRACKS:
-> The owner is the routing system. Dispatch decisions live in their head.
-> Quotes take too long because institutional knowledge isn't documented.
-> Project status lives in text threads and hallway conversations.
-> Service calls get handled by whoever picks up the phone. No triage. No priority.
-> New hires take 6+ months to become productive because nothing is written down.

None of these are emergencies on their own.
Together, they're a growth ceiling.

THE REAL COST:
It's not just inefficiency. It's opportunity cost.

The owner who spends 3 hours a day on coordination can't spend those hours on:
-> Business development
-> Strategic partnerships
-> Scaling to the next market

That's the wall.

WHAT THE BEST OPERATORS DO:
They don't buy enterprise software. They don't hire more managers.

They systematize one handoff at a time.

Quote-to-project. Dispatch. Service triage. Knowledge capture.

Pick the one that hurts most. Build a system around it. Move to the next.

That's how a $7M company becomes a $15M company without doubling headcount.

If this sounds familiar, you're not alone. It's the most common pattern we see.

What's the one process keeping you stuck?

## VISUAL CONCEPT

**Concept: The Growth Ceiling**

Split composition showing:
- **Bottom half:** Ascending revenue line (healthy, glowing amber-gold)
- **Top half:** Operational complexity lines tangling and crossing (teal, increasingly knotted)
- **Ceiling line** where the two meet -- the wall
- Small human figure at the intersection point, looking up

Warm Tech style: cream background, revenue line in amber-gold, ops complexity in teal, ceiling in soft warm gray.
