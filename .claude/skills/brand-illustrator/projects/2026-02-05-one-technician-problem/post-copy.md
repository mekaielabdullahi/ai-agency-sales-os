## FINAL POST

```
$180,000 per year.

That's what one printer repair business was losing.
Not to competition. To inefficiency.

THE PROBLEM:
Kelsey owns the business. Kelsey also runs every job.

→ He knows every printer model, every quirk, every fix
→ He's booked solid, morning to night
→ All the knowledge lives in his head

Kelsey hired Joe to help.
But Joe operates at 10% of Kelsey's capacity.

Why?
→ Joe calls Kelsey mid-job for help
→ Kelsey stops his work to explain
→ Same questions, different day
→ Both lose time. Customers wait.

Kelsey can't grow.
He can't take on more work.
He's stuck doing every job himself.

THE INSIGHT:
Small businesses don't fail from lack of talent.
They fail from knowledge trapped in the owner's head.

Hire someone new? They can't perform without you.
You get sick? Everything stops.

THE FIX:
We're building Kelsey an AI knowledge system.

→ Every call transcribed and searchable
→ Repair procedures captured automatically
→ Joe queries the system before calling Kelsey

Goal: Get Joe from 10% to 75% capable.
So Kelsey can stop being the bottleneck.

That's how a 3-person shop scales.

Who else has this problem?
You're the only one who knows how things work?
