# One Technician Problem - Image Prompt

**Project:** 2026-02-05-one-technician-problem
**Concept:** B - The Knowledge Flow Transformation
**Format:** LinkedIn Square (1080 x 1080)
**Context:** Kelsey is the owner AND the one doing all the jobs. Joe is a newer employee at 10% capacity who needs to stop calling Kelsey for help.

## Full Prompt

Create a warm tech illustration in isometric perspective showing a knowledge transformation from left to right.

**LEFT SIDE (The Problem):**
A business owner figure (Kelsey) overwhelmed - wearing both "owner hat" and "technician hat." Glowing brain/head containing locked knowledge icons. They're surrounded by job tickets, tools, AND business paperwork. A second figure (Joe, the employee) reaches toward Kelsey with question marks and phone call icons, constantly interrupting. Kelsey is the bottleneck - stuck doing every job while also running the business. The mood is constrained but not dark.

**CENTER (The Transformation):**
A glowing transformation zone using the Arise Glow gradient (amber → gold → soft teal). An AI processing node or knowledge capture system sits here, extracting Kelsey's expertise and organizing it into structured, searchable data streams.

**RIGHT SIDE (The Solution):**
Knowledge flows freely as organized data streams. Joe now accesses a glowing AI knowledge base directly - working independently without calling Kelsey. Kelsey is freed up, shown stepping back from jobs to focus on the business (owner role). Document icons, searchable databases, and flowing information particles show distributed knowledge. Joe is empowered and productive.

**Style:** Sophisticated and detailed but human and approachable - like Linear meets Stripe meets Notion but warmer. Precise, clean line work. Soft, diffused shadows. Detailed but not cluttered. Premium digital illustration quality. Warm and inviting atmosphere.

**Colors:**
- Primary accent: Warm amber (#E8914F) and gold (#F5C26B)
- Secondary accent: Soft teal (#2D7D8A)
- Background: Soft cream (#FDF8F3)
- Structure/outlines: Deep navy (#1A2B4A)
- Use amber-gold-teal gradient for the transformation zone and knowledge flow highlights
- Warm color temperature throughout

**Composition:** Left-to-right transformation flow. Clear visual distinction between the "before" (owner stuck doing everything) and "after" (employee empowered, owner freed). The transformation zone in the center is the brightest focal point with the Arise Glow gradient. Include subtle directional cues (arrows, flow lines) guiding the eye through the transformation.

**Format:** 1080 x 1080 pixels, square aspect ratio for LinkedIn.

**Quality:** High resolution, crisp details, clean edges on all elements, consistent warm lighting throughout, professional polished finish.

**Do NOT include:** Cold blue colors, pure white or pure black, harsh shadows, photorealistic elements, stock photo aesthetic, threatening or intimidating AI representations, cluttered or chaotic compositions, cartoonish style, rough textures, dark atmosphere, cool gray tones.
