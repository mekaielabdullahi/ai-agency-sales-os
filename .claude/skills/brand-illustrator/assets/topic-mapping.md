## Content Format Adaptations

### Blog Thumbnails

**Structure**:
- Single focal illustration (60% of frame)
- Clear, immediate recognition of topic
- Minimal supporting elements
- Bold, readable if title overlays

**Mapping Priority**:
1. Primary visual from topic mapping
2. Simplified composition
3. Maximum impact, minimum complexity

### LinkedIn Posts

**Structure**:
- Can be more conceptual/atmospheric
- Works as standalone visual or with text overlay
- Square or landscape format considerations
- Strong vertical or horizontal composition

**Mapping Priority**:
1. Emotional resonance first
2. Topic clarity second
3. Brand recognition through style

### Case Study Heroes

**Structure**:
- Can be more complex/detailed
- Transformation narrative suggested
- Full Arise Glow gradient appropriate
- Wider format, more breathing room

**Mapping Priority**:
1. Transformation journey
2. Success indicators
3. Industry/topic relevance

### Presentation Slides

**Structure**:
- Must work alongside text content
- Cleaner negative space required
- Can be partial illustration (cropped)
- Consistent placement across deck

**Mapping Priority**:
1. Support the message, don't compete
2. Consistent with other slides
3. Quick comprehension
