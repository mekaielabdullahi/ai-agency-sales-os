# AriseGroup.ai Aesthetic Style Guide

## The "Warm Tech" Style

AriseGroup.ai's illustration style is **"Warm Tech"**—sophisticated technical detail rendered with human warmth. This differentiates Arise from cold, generic tech imagery while maintaining credibility with technical audiences.

## Style Definition

### What "Warm Tech" Means

| Traditional Tech | Warm Tech (Arise) |
|------------------|-------------------|
| Cold blues and grays | Warm ambers, golds, soft teals |
| Harsh lighting | Soft, diffused light sources |
| Sterile environments | Inviting, approachable scenes |
| Intimidating complexity | Organized, understandable systems |
| Technology dominates | Technology serves humans |
| Flat, generic icons | Detailed, crafted illustrations |
| Stock photo aesthetic | Bespoke, distinctive visuals |

### The Emotional Target

Every illustration should make the viewer feel:
- **Confident**: "This looks professional and trustworthy"
- **Curious**: "I want to understand this better"
- **Optimistic**: "AI can help my business"
- **Comfortable**: "This doesn't feel intimidating"

## Technical Specifications

### Perspective

**Primary: Isometric**
- 30° angle from horizontal
- Consistent across all objects in scene
- Creates depth without distortion
- Professional, technical feel

**Secondary: Subtle 3D**
- Gentle perspective for single-object focus
- Slight depth, not dramatic
- Maintains approachability

**Avoid**:
- Extreme perspectives
- Flat 2D illustrations
- Inconsistent angles within same image

### Line Work

**Weight**
- Primary outlines: 2-3px (relative to 1920px canvas)
- Secondary details: 1-2px
- Subtle details: 0.5-1px

**Style**
- Clean, precise strokes
- Slight softness at endpoints (not harsh)
- Consistent weight within object categories
- Intentional, not sketchy

**Avoid**:
- Wobbly or hand-drawn appearance
- Inconsistent line weights
- Overly thin or thick lines
- Sharp, aggressive endpoints

### Shadows and Depth

**Shadow Style**
- Soft, diffused shadows
- Subtle drop shadows (never harsh)
- Ambient occlusion for grounding
- Shadow color: Soft navy or warm gray (never pure black)

**Shadow Settings** (reference for AI prompts)
- Blur: High (soft edges)
- Opacity: 15-30%
- Offset: Minimal to moderate
- Direction: Consistent light source (top-left or top-right)

**Avoid**:
- Hard-edged shadows
- Pure black shadows
- Dramatic shadow casting
- Inconsistent shadow directions

### Detail Level

**The Goldilocks Zone**
- Detailed enough to feel premium and crafted
- Not so detailed it becomes cluttered or overwhelming
- Every detail serves a purpose
- "Zoom in and discover more" quality

**Detail Hierarchy**
1. **Focal objects**: Full detail, crisp rendering
2. **Supporting objects**: Moderate detail, slightly softer
3. **Background elements**: Minimal detail, atmospheric

**Avoid**:
- Sparse, icon-like simplicity
- Overwhelming complexity
- Random detail for detail's sake
- Uniform detail across all elements

### Texture

**Approved Textures**
- Subtle gradients (smooth transitions)
- Soft metallic surfaces (warm-toned)
- Glass/translucent elements (with warm reflections)
- Matte surfaces with gentle shading

**Avoid**:
- Rough or gritty textures
- Photorealistic textures
- Noise or grain (unless very subtle)
- High-contrast textures

## Color Application

### Color Placement Strategy

**The Arise Glow**
- Use as accent and highlight
- Draw attention to key elements
- Create sense of energy and transformation
- Apply to: Light sources, important data, success indicators

**Deep Navy**
- Use for grounding and contrast
- Text, outlines, shadow bases
- Creates stability and trust
- Apply to: Text, borders, structural elements

**Warm Neutrals**
- Use for backgrounds and large areas
- Cream, warm white, soft beige
- Creates breathing room
- Apply to: Backgrounds, negative space, surfaces

### Gradient Usage

**Arise Glow Gradient**
Amber (#E8914F) → Gold (#F5C26B) → Soft Teal (#2D7D8A)

**Application**:
- Light beams and energy flows
- Highlight accents on key objects
- Progress indicators and growth elements
- Subtle background washes

**Rules**:
- Always flow in consistent direction (typically left→right or bottom→top)
- Use smooth transitions (no banding)
- Can use partial gradient (just amber-gold, or gold-teal)
- Reserve full gradient for hero moments

## Rendering Style

### Surface Rendering

**Objects should appear**:
- Slightly glossy but not reflective
- Dimensional with soft form shadows
- Warm in temperature (even metals)
- Clean and well-maintained

**Lighting approach**:
- Primary light: Warm, diffused, from top-left or top-right
- Fill light: Soft ambient to prevent harsh shadows
- Rim light: Subtle, uses brand colors for separation

### Human Figures (when included)

**Style**:
- Stylized, not photorealistic
- Geometric simplification
- Warm skin tones
- Professional attire implied
- Confident, positive postures

**Proportions**:
- Slightly idealized
- Clean silhouettes
- Minimal facial detail (features implied, not rendered)
- Focus on gesture and posture

**Avoid**:
- Photorealistic rendering
- Detailed facial features
- Casual or unprofessional appearance
- Cartoonish or childish proportions

## Reference Inspiration

### Brands to Draw From

**Linear**
- Take: Gradient spheres, precise aesthetic, premium feel
- Adapt: Add warmth to their cooler palette

**Stripe**
- Take: Detailed isometric illustrations, technical credibility
- Adapt: Warmer colors, softer shadows

**Notion**
- Take: Warm, inviting feel, approachability
- Adapt: Add more technical detail and sophistication

### Synthesis

Combine:
- Linear's precision + Stripe's detail + Notion's warmth
- Result: "Warm Tech" - sophisticated but inviting
