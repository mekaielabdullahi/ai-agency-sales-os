## 1. Insight Posts

### Template: The Observation

```
[Observation about common behavior/belief]

[Why this is problematic or limiting]

[The better approach/insight]

[Concrete example or data point]

[Takeaway or question]
```

**Example:**
```
Most businesses start their AI journey by asking "What can AI do?"

Better question: "What do we keep doing manually that we hate?"

That's where the real opportunities are.

One client found their team spent 12 hours/week on data entry.
Now it's automated. Those 12 hours? Back to growth work.

What repetitive task is eating your team's time?
```

---

### Template: The Contrast

```
[Old way / Common approach]

vs.

[New way / Better approach]

[Why the difference matters]

[Result or benefit]

[Invitation to reflect]
```

**Example:**
```
Hiring more people to handle more work.

vs.

Automating the work so your current team can handle more.

One scales your costs.
The other scales your capacity.

Which approach is your business taking?
```

---

## 2. Story Posts

### Template: The Client Win

```
[Setup - the challenge they faced]

[What we discovered/did together]

[The transformation - specific results]

[The lesson or insight]

[Soft CTA or reflection question]
```

**Example:**
```
A client came to us drowning in customer inquiries.

3-person team. 200+ emails daily. Response time: 48 hours.

After our AI audit, we found 70% of inquiries were the same 15 questions.

We built a smart FAQ + AI triage system.

Now:
→ 80% of inquiries handled automatically
→ Response time: under 5 minutes
→ Team focuses on complex cases only

Sometimes the solution isn't working harder. It's working smarter.

What's overwhelming your team right now?
```

---

### Template: The Lesson Learned

```
[Something that happened / we tried]

[What we expected vs. what actually happened]

[The insight or lesson]

[How this applies more broadly]

[Question or reflection]
```

**Example:**
```
We once spent 3 weeks building a complex AI workflow for a client.

They used it twice.

The lesson? We'd built what was technically impressive, not what was actually useful.

Now we start every project with one question:
"What's the ONE task you'd love to never do again?"

Start there. Build that. Then expand.

Complexity isn't the goal. Results are.
```

## 3. Myth-Buster Posts

### Template: The Truth About

```
"[Common belief or myth]"

[Why people believe this]

The truth:

[Reality with evidence/example]

[What this means for them]

[Reframe or new perspective]
```

**Example:**
```
"AI automation is too expensive for small businesses."

I hear this constantly. And I get it - enterprise AI projects cost millions.

The truth:

Most SMB automation projects cost less than one employee's monthly salary.
And they pay for themselves in 2-3 months.

We're not talking about building self-driving cars.
We're talking about automating invoice processing, email responses, data entry.

The question isn't cost. It's priority.

What would you automate if you knew it was affordable?
```

## 4. How-To Posts

### Template: The Quick Guide

```
How to [achieve desirable outcome]:

1. [Step one - concrete action]
2. [Step two - concrete action]
3. [Step three - concrete action]

[Why this works]

[Common mistake to avoid]

[Invitation to try or discuss]
```

**Example:**
```
How to find your best AI automation opportunities:

1. Track your team's time for one week
   (Just rough categories - what took the most hours?)

2. Flag anything repetitive or rule-based
   (If a checklist could do it, AI probably can too)

3. Estimate the cost of that time
   (Hours × hourly rate = your automation ROI potential)

Most businesses find 15-20 hours/week of automatable work.

The mistake? Trying to automate everything at once.
Pick the biggest time-sink. Start there.

What would your time audit reveal?
```

## 5. Engagement Posts

### Template: The Poll/Question

```
[Context or setup - 1-2 sentences]

[The question - clear and specific]

[Optional: Your take or hint at answer]
```

**Example:**
```
Curious about where businesses are in their AI journey.

What best describes your current AI usage?

A) We haven't started yet
B) Experimenting with tools like ChatGPT
C) Have some automations running
D) AI is integrated into our core operations

Drop your letter below - I'll share what I'm seeing across industries.
```

---

### Template: The "Unpack This"

```
[Bold statement or statistic]

[Let that sink in / Unpack what it means]

[Why this matters]

[Question to spark discussion]
```

**Example:**
```
40% of work tasks could be automated with current AI technology.

Not future AI. Current AI. Available today.

That's not about replacing people.
That's about freeing people to do work that actually matters.

The businesses that figure this out first?
They'll operate at a different level entirely.

What percentage of your work feels automatable?
```

---

## 6. Announcement Posts

### Template: The Soft Launch

```
[What's new - clear and concise]

[Why we created this / the problem it solves]

[Who it's for]

[What to do next - low friction]
```

**Example:**
```
We're now offering free 30-minute AI Audits for SMBs.

Here's why:

Too many businesses know AI could help them but don't know where to start.

In 30 minutes, we'll:
→ Map your biggest time-sinks
→ Identify 2-3 automation opportunities
→ Give you a clear next step (whether with us or not)

No pitch. No pressure. Just clarity.

DM me "audit" if you want one.

## Post Structure Guidelines

### Optimal Length
- **Short posts (engagement):** 50-100 words
- **Standard posts (value):** 150-250 words
- **Long posts (stories/guides):** 300-400 words

### Formatting Rules
- One idea per line (LinkedIn loves white space)
- Use line breaks liberally
- Bold/caps sparingly (for emphasis only)
- Emojis: 0-2 per post max (optional)
- Lists use → or • not numbers (unless sequence matters)

### Hook Requirements
- First line must stop the scroll
- No generic openings ("In today's world...")
- Lead with insight, question, or tension

### Closing Requirements
- Always end with engagement opportunity
- Question > Statement
- Low friction CTA ("DM me X" vs "Book a call")
