# AriseGroup.ai CTA Library

## Overview

Calls-to-action should feel like invitations, not demands. We favor soft CTAs that spark engagement over hard sells. Every CTA should offer value or connection, not just ask for something.

## CTA Philosophy

### Principles
1. **Give before you ask** - Provide value in the post first
2. **Low friction first** - Comment > DM > Link > Call
3. **Specific beats generic** - "DM me 'audit'" > "Contact us"
4. **Curiosity over pressure** - Invite exploration, don't push

### The CTA Ladder (Engagement Depth)
```
Level 1: Engage (lowest friction)
  → Comment, react, share opinion

Level 2: Connect (medium friction)
  → DM, follow, save post

Level 3: Convert (higher friction)
  → Click link, book call, sign up
```

Use Level 1-2 for most posts. Reserve Level 3 for announcements/offers.

## Engagement CTAs (Level 1)

### Questions That Spark Comments

**Opinion Questions:**
```
What's your take?
Agree or disagree?
What would you add?
Which resonates most with you?
```

**Experience Questions:**
```
What's been your experience with this?
Have you seen this in your business?

```

**Choice Questions:**
```
Which would you choose: A or B?
What would you prioritize first?
If you could only pick one, which?
```

**Curiosity Questions:**
```

**Reflection Questions:**
```
Does this sound familiar?
When's the last time you thought about this?
What would this change for your business?
```

## CTA Combinations

### The Double Hook
Ask a question AND offer a resource:
```
What would you automate first?

(DM me "audit" if you want help figuring it out)
```

### The Soft Ladder
Engage first, then offer next step:
```
Does this resonate? Let me know in the comments.

If you want to go deeper, DM me "efficiency" and I'll share our process.
```

### The Value-First Close
Provide something free, then invite conversation:
```
I put together a checklist for this - comment "checklist" and I'll send it.

Or DM me if you want to talk through your specific situation.
```
