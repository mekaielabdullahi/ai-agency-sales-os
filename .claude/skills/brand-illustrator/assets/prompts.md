[FOCAL POINT]
The transformation zone with gradient glow

[SUPPORTING ELEMENTS]
- Before state (organized but dated)
- After state (modern, efficient)
- Bridge or flow connecting them
- Particle effects in transition zone
```

### Training / Education

- Upward-flowing information
- Lightbulb or insight indicators
- Growth trajectory
```

### Security / Trust

## Composition Specifications

### System View (Complex, Interconnected)

```
[COMPOSITION]
Bird's eye or elevated isometric view showing multiple interconnected elements. Create clear visual hierarchy with primary element larger/centered, supporting elements arranged around it with visible connections. Include negative space for breathing room. 60% focal element, 30% supporting, 10% space.
```

### Focus View (Single Subject)

```
[COMPOSITION]
Centered composition with single primary element as clear focal point. Rich detail on the subject, minimal background elements. Clean negative space around edges. Subject occupies 60-70% of frame with room for optional text overlay.
```

### Transformation View (Before → After)

```
[COMPOSITION]
Left-to-right or bottom-to-top flow showing change. Clear visual distinction between states but both rendered in brand style. Transition zone highlighted with Arise Glow gradient. Include subtle directional cues guiding the eye through the transformation.
```

### Journey View (Path/Progress)

```
[COMPOSITION]
Perspective showing depth with path extending toward horizon. Foreground detail transitions to atmospheric background. Milestone moments along the path. Creates sense of movement and possibility.
```

### Partnership View (Human + AI)

```
[COMPOSITION]
Balanced composition with human figure and technology elements sharing the frame. Neither dominates - collaboration is evident. Warm connection point between human and tech elements. Inviting, non-threatening arrangement.
