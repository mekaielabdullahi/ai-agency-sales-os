## Language Guidelines

### Words We Use
| Instead of... | We say... |
|--------------|-----------|
| Leverage | Use |
| Utilize | Use |
| Synergy | Work together |
| Disrupt | Transform, improve |
| AI solution | AI tool, automation |
| Pain points | Challenges, friction |

| Best-in-class | Effective, proven |

### Power Words (Use Often)

### Words to Avoid

- Corporate speak ("circle back", "move the needle")
- Overpromising ("guaranteed", "instant results")

## Writing Patterns

### The Hook Formula
Start with one of these patterns:
1. **Observation:** "Most businesses [common mistake/belief]..."
2. **Question:** "What if [desirable outcome] was possible?"
3. **Contrast:** "[Old way] vs [New way]"
4. **Story:** "A client recently told me..."
5. **Insight:** "Here's what [X] taught me about [Y]..."

### The Value Bridge
Connect AI concepts to business outcomes:
- "This means..." (translate tech to benefit)
- "For your business, that looks like..." (make it concrete)
- "The result?" (state the outcome)

### The Soft Close
End without being salesy:
- "Curious how this applies to your business?"
- "What's one process you'd love to automate?"
- "Drop a comment if this resonates."
- "DM me 'audit' if you want to explore this."

## Sample Voice Examples

### LinkedIn Post (Good)
```
Most businesses think AI automation is only for big companies with big budgets.

Here's the truth: The best automation opportunities are often the boring, repetitive tasks your team does every day.

Data entry. Follow-up emails. Report generation. Scheduling.

These aren't glamorous. But automating them?
→ 10+ hours saved per week
→ Fewer errors
→ Team focused on actual growth work

The question isn't whether you can afford AI automation.
It's whether you can afford to keep doing things manually.

What task would you automate first?
```
