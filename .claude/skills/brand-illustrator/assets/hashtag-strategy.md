# AriseGroup.ai Hashtag Strategy

## Overview

Hashtags on LinkedIn serve two purposes: discovery and positioning. We use them strategically, not excessively. Quality over quantity - 3-5 targeted hashtags per post.

---

## Target Audience

Our hashtags should help us get discovered by:

| Audience | Who They Are | What They Search |
|----------|--------------|------------------|
| **Service Business Owners** | HVAC, plumbers, electricians, repair shops, trades | Operations, efficiency, scaling |
| **Small Business Owners** | Owner-operators with 2-20 employees | Growth, time savings, systems |
| **Founders & CEOs** | Tech-forward leaders at growing companies | AI transformation, strategy |
| **Operations Managers** | Process & efficiency responsible | Workflows, automation, SOPs |
| **AI-Native Professionals** | Early adopters building with AI | AI tools, implementation, adoption |

## Placement Guidelines

### Where to Put Hashtags
**Option A: End of post (preferred)**
```
[Post content]

What would you automate first?

#AriseWithAI #AIforBusiness #BusinessAutomation
```

**Option B: First comment**
Post hashtags as first comment to keep post clean. Works well for longer posts.

### Formatting
- All hashtags on one line or grouped naturally
- No hashtags mid-sentence (breaks reading flow)
- No hashtag-stuffing (max 5)
