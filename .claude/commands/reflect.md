- What's my theme for next week?

### 3. Decision Reflection
**Best for**: Before major decisions

Questions:
- What am I really trying to achieve?
- What are my options?
- What are the second-order consequences of each?
- What would I advise a friend to do?
- What will I think of this decision in 10 years?

### 4. Problem Reflection
**Best for**: When stuck

Questions:
- What's the real problem here?
- What have I tried that hasn't worked?

## Tips for Effective Reflection

1. **Be honest** - This is private, no judgment
2. **Write freely** - Don't edit as you go
3. **Look for patterns** - What keeps coming up?
4. **End with action** - Reflection without action is just rumination
5. **Keep it short** - 5-15 minutes is enough
6. **Be consistent** - Daily > occasional deep dives
