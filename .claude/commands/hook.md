## Hook Frameworks

### 1. Pattern Interrupt
Break expectations with unexpected statements
- "Stop doing [common thing]. Here's why..."
- "Everything you know about [topic] is wrong"

### 2. Curiosity Gap
Create information gaps that demand closure
- "The [hidden/secret/surprising] reason why..."
- "What [successful people] never tell you about..."

### 3. Specificity Power
Use specific numbers and details
- "[X] [specific things] that [benefit] in [timeframe]"
- "How I [achieved result] in [specific time] without [sacrifice]"

### 4. Contrarian Angle
Challenge conventional wisdom
- "Why [popular advice] is actually hurting you"
- "[Unpopular opinion]: [Bold claim]"

### 5. Story Hook
Start with a narrative moment
- "Last Tuesday, I made a decision that..."
- "My client asked me: '[Question]' My answer surprised them."

### 6. Question Hook
Ask thought-provoking questions
- "What if [premise]?"
- "Have you ever wondered why [observation]?"
