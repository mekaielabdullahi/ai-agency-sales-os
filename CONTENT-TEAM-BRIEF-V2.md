## Based on Shreya Pattar's Coaching + Personal Brand Strategy

**Date:** December 3, 2025
**Status:** ACTIVE - Implementation Starting Week 1
**Team:** Content Strategist, Writer, Designer, Community Manager

---

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: WHAT CHANGED

### **Strategic Pivot (Per Shreya's Coaching):**

**OLD APPROACH ❌**
- Mekaiel positioned as "teacher/authority"
- Content focused on educational insights
- Agency brand and personal brand mixed
- Solo posting strategy

**NEW APPROACH ✅**
- **Mekaiel positioned as "founder/storyteller"**
- **Content focused on narrative-driven case studies and founder journey**
- **Personal brand (Mekaiel) separate from agency brand (AriseGroup)**
- **Team coordination: 4 founders × 3 posts/week = 12 posts/week**
- **Cross-amplification through rotating reposts**

---

## YOUR MISSION

Help Mekaiel build a personal brand on LinkedIn that:

1. **Documents the founder journey** (building AriseGroup from 0 to sustainable AI transformation firm)
2. **Shares client transformation stories** (before/after case studies with measurable results)
3. **Demonstrates unique approach** (prerequisites-first, operator mindset, integrity over revenue)
4. **Attracts ideal clients** (defense contractors, government agencies, manufacturers, construction firms)
5. **Builds trust through transparency** (show the process, share failures, credit the team)

**Content output:** 3 posts per week for Mekaiel + support for team coordination

[Repost teammate's post]

Mekaiel's commentary:
"This is exactly the pattern we see in [Mekaiel's vertical] too.

[Specific connection to Mekaiel's experience]

[Key insight or lesson]

[Credit to team member]."
```

**Example:**
```
[Trent's post about industrial automation case study]

Mekaiel:
"This is exactly what we see in defense contractors.

Trent built the SCADA integration BEFORE adding AI.
That's why the project succeeded.

The principles are universal:
→ Foundation first
→ Then AI layer
→ Then training and adoption

Nailed it, Trent."
```

**Why This Works:**
- 4x reach amplification (everyone's content gets boosted)
- Shows unified team (credibility)
- Different perspectives on same principles
- 12 posts/week = consistent presence without burnout

## CONTENT FORMATS (Per Shreya's Coaching)

### **1. PDF Carousels (HIGH PRIORITY)**

**Why PDFs:**
- LinkedIn algorithm favors PDFs (keeps users on platform = higher reach)
- Users can download/save (perceived value)
- Better mobile swipe experience than image carousels
- Easier to create (design in Canva, export as PDF, upload)

**How to Create:**
1. Design 8-10 slides in Canva (1080x1080px each)
2. Use templates above (Case Study, Framework, etc.)
3. Export as PDF
4. Upload to LinkedIn as "Document" (not image)
5. Write compelling post text to accompany

**Frequency Target:** 1 PDF carousel per week minimum

**Topics Best for PDF:**
- Case studies (8-10 slide breakdown)
- Frameworks (5 Questions, Prerequisites Checklist)
- Project timelines (Week-by-week what happens)
- Before/after transformations (multiple slides showing progression)

---

### **2. Video Content (MEDIUM PRIORITY)**

**Type 1: Loom Explainer Videos (3-5 minutes)**

**Best For:**
- Process walkthroughs ("Here's how we run discovery calls")
- Screen shares ("This is what broken data infrastructure looks like")
- Case study deep-dives (walk through project step-by-step)

**Format:**
- Screen recording with voiceover (Loom, Vidyard, or LinkedIn native)
- Talking head intro (10-15 sec: "Hey, Mekaiel here...")
- Visual walkthrough (2-4 min: screen + voiceover)
- Talking head outro + CTA (10-15 sec: "If this was helpful, follow for more")

**Production:**
- No fancy editing needed (authenticity > polish)
- Good lighting, clear audio (built-in mic is fine)
- Upload natively to LinkedIn (don't link to YouTube)

**Frequency:** 1 video every 2 weeks

---

**Type 2: Short-Form Videos (30-60 seconds)**

**Best For:**
- Quick insights ("3 red flags your AI project will fail")
- Founder moments ("Here's what we built this week")
- Thought snippets ("The question I ask in every discovery call")

**Format:**
- Talking head (phone camera, vertical or square)
- Fast-paced, energetic (hold attention)
- Text overlays for key points (use CapCut or InShot)
- LinkedIn native upload

**Production:**
- Phone camera is fine (good lighting matters most)
- Subtitle with text overlays (80% watch without sound)
- 30-60 sec max (attention span)

**Frequency:** 1 short video per week (optional, test and see)

---

**Type 3: Group Interviews/Panels (10-20 minutes)**

**Best For:**
- Team discussions ("4 founders discuss why AI projects fail")
- Industry round tables ("Defense vs Industrial vs E-commerce AI challenges")
- Client interviews ("Transformation journey in their words")

**Format:**
- Zoom recording with 2-4 people
- Conversational, not scripted
- Edit into highlight clips (3-5 min segments)
- Post full video + create 3-4 short clips for separate posts

**Frequency:** 1 group discussion per month (lower priority, high impact when done)

---

### **3. Text-Only Posts (ALWAYS INCLUDE)**

**Why Text Posts Still Matter:**
- Fastest to create (no design needed)
- High engagement when story is compelling
- Accessible (no barriers to consumption)
- Great for founder journey, personal stories

**Best For:**
- Pillar 3 content (Founder journey, personal learnings)
- Quick insights or observations
- Engagement questions

**Format:**
- 600-1000 words (LinkedIn allows up to ~3000 characters)
- Break into short paragraphs (2-3 lines max)
- Use bullets, numbers, section breaks
- No image needed (text-only can perform well)

**Frequency:** At least 1 text-only post per week

---

---

## VOICE & TONE GUIDELINES

### **Mekaiel's Voice (YOU MUST MATCH THIS):**

✅ **DO:**
- Write as operator/founder (first-person: "I", "we")
- Use specific numbers ($48K saved, 20 hours/week, 6 months ROI)
- Tell stories with narrative arc (beginning → middle → end)
- Be transparent about challenges, failures, mistakes
- Give credit to team and clients (humble about wins)
- Show the "unsexy" work (data integration, not just AI)
- End with questions (engage audience, don't lecture)
- Use military/defense terminology when relevant (SIEM, DoD compliance, clearance)

❌ **DON'T:**
- Hype or exaggeration ("revolutionary", "game-changing", "disrupting the industry")
- Guru/teacher positioning ("I teach", "let me show you", "here's the secret")
- Sales pitches ("Book a call now", "Limited time offer", "Buy from us")
- Generic platitudes ("Work hard and believe", "Dream big", "Never give up")
- Corporate jargon ("synergies", "leverage", "paradigm shift", "thought leader")
- Humble-bragging ("So grateful for this journey", "Blessed to announce")
- Abstract concepts without examples (always back up claims with specifics)

---

### **Sentence Structure:**

**GOOD:**
```
Short sentences.
Clear thoughts.
Easy to scan on mobile.

Use line breaks generously.

Bullets with → or ✓ for lists.

Section breaks with --- for new topics.

One idea per paragraph.
```

**BAD:**
```
Long, run-on sentences that try to pack multiple complex ideas into a single thought without giving the reader a chance to breathe or process the information being presented, which makes it harder to read on mobile and reduces engagement because people lose track of what you're trying to say.
```

---

### **Emotion Level:**

**Authentic, Not Performative:**
- ✅ "This was frustrating. We almost walked away."
- ✅ "I'm genuinely proud of what the team built here."
- ✅ "I didn't see this coming. Here's what I learned."
- ✅ "This is why integrity matters more than revenue."

**Not:**
- ❌ "SO EXCITED to announce!!!"
- ❌ "I'm nobody special, just a guy trying his best 🙏"
- ❌ "Vulnerable share incoming..."
- ❌ "This BLEW MY MIND 🤯"

---

## ENGAGEMENT RESPONSE TEMPLATES

### **How Mekaiel Should Respond to Comments:**

**Type 1: Agreement/Praise**
```
Comment: "This is so true! We wasted $100K on AI that didn't work."

Suggested Response:
"What was the missing piece for you? Data integration? Process documentation?
I'd love to hear more about what happened."
```
→ **Strategy:** Turn praise into conversation, learn about their situation

---

**Type 2: Question**
```
Comment: "What's the first prerequisite you'd recommend starting with?"

Suggested Response:
"Great question. 99% of the time, it's data integration.
If your systems don't talk to each other, AI has nothing to learn from.
Want me to send you the full prerequisites checklist?"
```
→ **Strategy:** Answer directly, offer additional value (lead magnet)

---

**Type 3: Disagreement**
```
Comment: "I disagree. AI can work without all these prerequisites."

Suggested Response:
"Interesting take. What's been your experience?
I'd love to see an example where it worked without solid data infrastructure.
Always open to learning from different approaches."
```
→ **Strategy:** Stay curious, not defensive; invite dialogue (don't argue)

---

**Type 4: Sales Inquiry**
```
Comment: "We need this. Can you help us?"

Suggested Response:
"DMing you now."
```
→ **Strategy:** Keep sales conversations private (move to DM immediately)

---

**Type 5: Competitor/Vendor Criticism**
```
Comment: "Our current vendor does this differently. They built AI first and it worked fine."

Suggested Response:
"That's great! I'd love to hear more about what made it successful.
In my experience, 80% fail without the foundation, but there are always exceptions.
What do you think was different in your case?"
```
→ **Strategy:** Don't badmouth competitors, stay professional, stay curious
