# ARISEGROUP COLLABORATION FRAMEWORK
## Four Independent Agencies, One Unified Client Experience

**Version:** 2.0 (Corrected)
**Date:** December 2, 2025
**Status:** ACTIVE AGREEMENT
**Partners:** Chris, Mekaiel, Trent, Matthew

---

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

**What We Are:**
Four independent one-person agencies collaborating on a project-by-project basis to deliver AI transformation services.

**What We Are NOT (Yet):**
- One unified company
- A formal LLC or partnership entity
- An equity-based structure
- A hierarchical organization

**Current Phase:**
Testing the collaboration model to validate:
- Can we work together effectively?
- Is there demand for our combined offering?
- What's the optimal revenue split?
- Should we eventually formalize into one company?

**Decision Point:**
After 3-6 months of project-by-project work, we'll decide whether to formalize into AriseGroup LLC or continue as independent collaborators.

---

## SECTION 2: PROJECT-BY-PROJECT COLLABORATION MODEL

### How Projects Work

**Step 1: Lead Origination**

**Primary:** Chris (Lead Origination role)
- Generates leads through his network (construction/portable buildings)
- Maintains lead lists
- Initial outreach and qualification

**Secondary:** Any partner can bring leads from their network
- Mekaiel: Defense/government contacts
- Trent: Industrial automation contacts
- Matthew: E-commerce contacts

**Rule:** Whoever originates the lead gets "Lead Originator" role credit

---

**Step 2: Sales & Discovery**

**Primary:** Chris (Sales Strategy role)
- Runs discovery calls using Q1-Q5 framework
- Qualifies opportunity
- Determines scope and roles needed

**Support:** Mekaiel (Sales Ops role)
- Assists with offer creation
- Provides sales operations support
- Helps structure the engagement

**Output:**
- Qualified opportunity
- Roles needed for delivery identified
- Revenue split proposed

---

**Step 3: Scoping & Proposal**

**Team Discussion (Slack/Quick Call):**

```
**Project:** [Company Name] - [Brief description]
**Size:** $X,XXX estimated
**Roles Needed:**
- Lead Originator: Chris
- Sales: Chris
- Systems Architecture: Mekaiel
- Software Dev: Matthew (or Trent, depending on scope)
- Client Onboarding: Mekaiel

**Proposed Split:**
- Chris: 40% (Lead Originator 20% + Sales 20%)
- Mekaiel: 35% (Systems Architecture 25% + Onboarding 10%)
- Matthew: 25% (Software Dev)
- Trent: 0% (not needed for this project)

**Everyone OK with this split?**
Responses within 24 hours.
```

**Vote:** Simple majority (3 of 4) to proceed

---

**Step 4: Proposal & Closing**

**Lead:** Chris (Sales) + Mekaiel (Offer Creation)
- Create proposal using AriseGroup branding
- Price: $3K-$10K range
- Include 30-day support period
- Present to client

**Payment Structure:**
- 50% upfront
- 50% on delivery
- Goes to one person's account (rotate or designate "banker" per project)
- That person distributes to others per agreed split

---

**Step 5: Delivery**

**Roles Execute:**
- Mekaiel: Systems architecture, onboarding processes
- Matthew or Trent: Software development, prototyping
- Chris: Client communication, project management

**Collaboration:**
- Slack for daily communication
- Weekly project check-ins (15 min)
- Shared project management (Notion or similar)

**Timeline:** Typical 2-4 weeks delivery

---

**Step 6: Handoff & Support**

**30-Day Support Included:**
- Bug fixes
- Minor adjustments
- User training questions

**Responsibility:** Whoever built it supports it (dev team)

**Post-30 Days:**
- Ongoing support becomes optional paid engagement
- Opportunity to pitch retainer/ongoing relationship

---

**Step 7: Revenue Distribution**

**Process:**

1. Client pays → Goes to designated "banker" account for that project
2. Within 5 business days, banker distributes to others per agreed split
3. Each person invoices their own LLC/sole prop to the banker (for accounting)
4. Everyone reports on their own taxes

**Example:**
- Project total: $8,000
- Chris (40%): $3,200
- Mekaiel (35%): $2,800
- Matthew (25%): $2,000
- Client pays Chris's Remus Development LLC $8,000
- Chris sends $2,800 to Mekaiel, $2,000 to Matthew
- Mekaiel and Matthew send invoices to Chris for records

**"Banker" rotates** or is designated per project (whoever has best accounting setup)

---

### How to Calculate Splits Per Project

**Example Project 1: E-commerce automation ($6,000)**

Roles needed:
- Lead Originator: Matthew (brought lead from InfinityVault network)
- Sales: Chris (ran discovery and closed)
- Systems Architecture: Mekaiel (designed solution)
- Software Dev: Matthew (built it)
- Client Onboarding: Mekaiel (training)

Split calculation:
- Matthew: 15% (Lead Originator) + 30% (Software Dev) = 45% = $2,700
- Chris: 20% (Sales) = $1,200
- Mekaiel: 25% (Systems Architecture) + 10% (Onboarding) = 35% = $2,100
- Trent: 0% (not needed) = $0

Total: 100% = $6,000

---

**Example Project 2: Industrial robotics automation ($9,000)**

Roles needed:
- Lead Originator: Trent (brought lead from 4.0 Hero network)
- Sales: Chris (ran discovery and closed)
- Systems Architecture: Mekaiel (designed solution)
- Robotics Dev: Trent (built physical automation)
- Software Dev: Matthew (built software interface)
- Client Onboarding: Trent (plant floor training)

Split calculation:
- Trent: 15% (Lead Originator) + 30% (Robotics Dev) + 10% (Onboarding) = 55% = $4,950
- Chris: 15% (Sales) = $1,350
- Mekaiel: 20% (Systems Architecture) = $1,800
- Matthew: 10% (Software Dev - smaller component) = $900

Total: 100% = $9,000

---

**Example Project 3: Defense contractor operations automation ($10,000)**

Roles needed:
- Lead Originator: Mekaiel (brought lead from DoD network)
- Sales: Mekaiel (ran discovery - he knows the client language)
- Sales Ops: Chris (helped structure offer)
- Systems Architecture: Mekaiel (designed solution)
- Software Dev: Matthew (built it)
- Client Onboarding: Mekaiel (security compliance training)

Split calculation:
- Mekaiel: 15% (Lead Originator) + 15% (Sales) + 25% (Systems Architecture) + 10% (Onboarding) = 65% = $6,500
- Matthew: 25% (Software Dev) = $2,500
- Chris: 10% (Sales Ops) = $1,000
- Trent: 0% (not needed) = $0

Total: 100% = $10,000

---

### Role Negotiation Process

**Before project starts:**

1. **Scoping call** (15-30 min, all 4 partners or just those involved)
2. **Identify roles needed** for this specific project
3. **Propose split** based on role framework above
4. **Discuss and adjust** if anyone feels it's unfair
5. **Vote to approve** (simple majority of those involved)
6. **Document in Notion** before work begins

**Rule:** No work starts until split is agreed in writing (Slack/Notion)

**Dispute resolution:** If 2-2 tie, the person doing the most work (highest %) has tie-breaker vote

---

## SECTION 4: OPERATING AGREEMENTS

### Decision-Making Framework

**Individual Project Decisions** (No vote needed)
- How you execute your role
- Tools you use
- Your own work schedule
- Client communication in your domain

**Project-Level Decisions** (Involved partners vote)
- Revenue split for that project
- Timeline commitments
- Scope changes mid-project
- Client pricing

**Brand-Level Decisions** (All 4 partners vote)
- AriseGroup brand positioning
- Website/marketing materials
- Which markets to target
- Standard pricing ranges
- Whether to formalize into one company

**Voting Rules:**
- Simple majority for project decisions
- Unanimous for brand/business model changes

### Communication Protocols

**Daily:** Slack for async updates
**Weekly:** 30-min team sync (Mondays 6pm)
- Share pipeline
- Discuss active projects
- Coordinate on leads

**Monthly:** 60-min strategy session
- Review what's working
- Adjust role framework if needed
- Discuss potential formalization

### Lead Sharing

**If you bring a lead:**
- You get Lead Originator credit (15-20%)
- You choose who else to involve from the team
- You can take it solo if you want (100% but you do all roles)

**Lead Routing:**
- Defense/Gov leads → Offer to Mekaiel first
- Industrial/Manufacturing → Offer to Trent first
- E-commerce → Offer to Matthew first
- Construction → Chris handles or loops in team

**Not mandatory** - just courteous to give right-of-first-refusal to the expert

### Client Billing & Accounting

**Option A: Rotating Banker** (Recommended initially)
- Designate one person per project to be "banker"
- They receive client payment
- They distribute to others within 5 business days
- Others invoice the banker for accounting records

**Option B: Shared Bank Account** (If we formalize later)
- Open shared AriseGroup account
- All payments go there
- Designated person manages distributions
- Requires formal entity (LLC)

**Tax Implications:**
- Each person reports their own income
- Each person responsible for own taxes
- No partnership tax return needed (we're independent contractors collaborating)

**Insurance:**
- Each person maintains their own business insurance
- Each person responsible for own liability
- Consider umbrella policy if projects get larger

### IP Ownership

**Client IP:**
- Client owns all deliverables (standard work-for-hire)
- We retain right to use as case study (with permission)

**Internal IP:**
- Processes, frameworks, systems we build → Shared ownership
- Can't take to a competitor or use to hurt the group
- If we formalize, this becomes company IP
- If we dissolve, everyone keeps their own contributions

**Code/Tech Assets:**
- Reusable code modules → Shared among the 4 of us
- Can't sell or license without group approval
- If someone leaves, they keep access but can't commercialize without others

### Confidentiality & Non-Compete

**During Collaboration:**
- Don't compete directly with AriseGroup projects
- Don't steal leads from each other
- Keep client information confidential
- Don't work with each other's clients behind their back

**If Someone Leaves:**
- 30-day notice preferred
- Finish current projects
- Clients brought by that person → They decide if they take or leave
- Shared clients → Negotiate case-by-case
- No formal non-compete (we're independent agencies)

**Basically: Don't be a jerk. Act in good faith.**

---

## SECTION 5: PROJECT SIZE & PRICING

### Current Project Range: $3,000 - $10,000

**Why this range:**
- Validates the model without huge risk
- Achievable in 2-4 week delivery timeline
- Room for profit after 4-way split
- Clients can afford without long procurement

**Pricing Formula:**

**Base Calculation:**
30-40% of client's Q2 monthly cost (from discovery call)

**Example:**
- Q2: "This costs us $15K/month in wasted time"
- Pricing: 30-40% = $4,500 - $6,000
- Round to: $5,000 project

**Prerequisites Adjustment:**
If significant prerequisites needed (data integration, system setup):
- Add $2K-$5K to base price
- Example: $5K base + $3K prerequisites = $8K total

**Complexity Multiplier:**
- Simple (mostly config, light code): 30% of Q2
- Medium (custom dev, integrations): 35% of Q2
- Complex (multi-system, robotics): 40% of Q2

### What's Included

**Standard Deliverables:**
- Initial discovery and scoping
- Systems architecture/design
- Development/implementation
- Testing and QA
- User training (2-4 hours)
- Documentation
- **30-day support period** (bug fixes, minor adjustments, questions)

**NOT Included (Additional Cost):**
- Ongoing support beyond 30 days
- Major feature additions
- Expansion to other departments
- Monthly retainer

**Opportunity:** Pitch ongoing support at end of 30 days
- Tier 1: $500-$1,500/month (maintenance)
- Tier 2: $1,500-$3,000/month (ongoing development)

### Payment Terms

**Standard:**
- 50% upfront (upon contract signing)
- 50% on delivery (before 30-day support period)

**For Larger Projects ($8K+):**
- 40% upfront
- 30% at mid-point milestone
- 30% on delivery

**For Smaller Projects ($3-5K):**
- Consider 100% upfront (reduces collection risk)
- Or standard 50/50

**Late Payment:**
- 30-day support doesn't start until final payment received
- Net 15 terms (payment due within 15 days of delivery)

---

## SECTION 6: TESTING PHASE METRICS

### What We're Measuring (First 90 Days)

**Project Metrics:**
| Metric | Target | Why It Matters |
|--------|--------|----------------|
| Projects closed | 6-12 | Validates demand |
| Average project size | $5K-$7K | Revenue sustainability |
| Delivery timeline | 2-4 weeks | Operational efficiency |
| Client satisfaction | 8+/10 | Referrals and reputation |
| Repeat/referral rate | 30%+ | Model is working |

**Revenue Metrics:**
| Metric | Target (90 days) | Per Person |
|--------|------------------|------------|
| Total revenue | $30K-$70K | $7.5K-$17.5K each |
| Revenue per project | $5K-$7K avg | Varies by split |
| Ongoing support revenue | $3K-$10K | Bonus opportunity |

**Collaboration Metrics:**
| Metric | Target | Why It Matters |
|--------|--------|----------------|
| Role conflicts | <2 | Smooth collaboration |
| Payment disputes | 0 | Trust and fairness |
| Communication quality | High | Team cohesion |
| All 4 partners involved? | Yes | Not just 2-3 people |

### Success Criteria (Decide to Formalize?)

**After 90 days, ask:**

✅ **Did we close 6+ projects together?**
- Yes → Demand validated
- No → Maybe not enough leads, or model doesn't work

✅ **Did we work well together?**
- Yes → Good partnership fit
- No → Maybe stay independent

✅ **Did everyone get fair revenue splits?**
- Yes → Role framework works
- No → Needs adjustment or rethinking

✅ **Did clients perceive us as one unified firm?**
- Yes → Brand is working
- No → Confusing positioning

✅ **Do we want to scale this?**
- Yes → Formalize into AriseGroup LLC
- No → Continue as independent collaborators (which is fine!)

**Decision Point:** Month 4 (End of 90-day test)
- Meeting: All 4 partners, 2-hour discussion
- Vote: Formalize into one company? Or stay independent?
- If formalize → Use equity/structure framework (separate discussion)
- If stay independent → Refine role framework and continue

---

## SECTION 7: FUTURE FORMALIZATION (IF WE DECIDE TO)

### What Formalization Would Look Like

**If after 90 days we vote to formalize:**

**Legal Entity:**
- Form AriseGroup LLC
- Operating agreement with equity split
- Shared bank account
- Unified accounting

**Equity Split Options:**

**Option A: Equal (25% each)**
- Simple, no politics
- Best if everyone contributes equally

**Option B: Weighted by Historical Revenue**
- Track 90-day revenue per person
- Award equity proportional to contribution
- Example: If Chris brought 40% of revenue → 40% equity

**Option C: Role-Based Equity**
- CEO/Sales: 30%
- COO/Systems: 25%
- CTO/Dev: 25%
- VP/Dev: 20%

**Recommendation:** Don't decide equity until we have 90 days of data

**Operating Model Changes:**
- From project splits → Salaries + bonuses
- From independent invoicing → Company payroll
- From ad-hoc → Formal structure

**This is a FUTURE decision. Not now.**

## SECTION 10: RISK MITIGATION

### Risk #1: Revenue Split Disputes

**Mitigation:**
- Agree on split BEFORE work starts
- Document in Notion/Slack
- If someone feels unfairly compensated → Discuss immediately
- Adjust for next project

### Risk #2: Unequal Workload

**Mitigation:**
- Track who's working on what
- If one person doing all the work → That person gets larger %
- Monthly check-in: Is workload balanced?
- Adjust role framework if needed

### Risk #3: Payment Delays

**Mitigation:**
- 50% upfront (de-risks non-payment)
- Net 15 terms (payment due quickly)
- Banker distributes within 5 days (no hoarding)
- Track in shared spreadsheet

### Risk #4: Client Confusion

**Mitigation:**
- Always present as "AriseGroup"
- One point of contact per client (usually sales person)
- Consistent branding
- Don't mention 4 separate companies to client

### Risk #5: Someone Leaves Early

**Mitigation:**
- Finish current projects
- Clients they brought → They decide
- Shared clients → Negotiate
- Part as friends (no non-compete)
