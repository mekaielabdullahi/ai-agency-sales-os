## Framework 1: Problem-Solution-Value (PSV)

**Best For**: Educational content, thought leadership, showcasing expertise

Mornings recovered. Clarity gained. Execution starts immediately.

## Framework 3: Story Arc

**Best For**: Personal stories, case studies, transformation narratives

**Structure**:
```
[Hook: Compelling opening]

THE BEFORE:
[Where you/client started]
[Specific struggles and pain]

THE SHIFT:
[What changed, what you discovered]
[The key insight or decision]

THE AFTER:
[Current state]
[Specific results]

THE LESSON:
[Universal insight others can apply]

[Optional CTA]
```

**Example**:
```
I used to bill 60-hour weeks but barely move my business forward.

THE BEFORE:
Busy every day. Exhausted every night.
Revenue? Stuck at the same ceiling for 8 months.

THE SHIFT:
Realized I had zero systems. Just daily reaction mode.
Built an AI-powered operations system to force strategic focus.

THE AFTER:
Same work hours. 40% more revenue.
Finally working ON the business, not just IN it.

THE LESSON:
You can't scale chaos. Systematize first, scale second.

Working on making this available to other business owners.
```

## Framework 4: Contrarian Take

**Best For**: Thought leadership, standing out, challenging norms

**Structure**:
```
[Bold contrarian statement]

Most people think [common belief].

But here's the truth:
[Your contrarian view]

Why everyone gets this wrong:
→ [Reason 1]
→ [Reason 2]
→ [Reason 3]

What actually works:
[Your alternative approach]

[Results/proof]

[Optional CTA]
```

**Example**:
```
Stop trying to be more productive.

Most productivity advice is garbage.

"Wake up at 5 AM"
"Hustle harder"
"Optimize every minute"

Wrong approach.

The real win?
→ Better systems, not more hours
→ Strategic focus, not busy work
→ Automation, not optimization

I work fewer hours than last year.
Revenue up 40%.

Systems beat hustle every time.
```

## Framework 6: Question Hook

**Best For**: Engagement, starting conversations, thought-provoking

**Structure**:
```
[Provocative question]

[2-3 sentences expanding on the question]

Here's what most people miss:
[Your insight]

[Supporting points or examples]

The real question is:
[Reframe or deeper question]

[Your perspective]

[Optional CTA]
```

**Example**:
```
Is your business running you, or are you running your business?

If you spend more time reacting than planning, you know the answer.

Here's what most people miss:
The problem isn't lack of effort. It's lack of systems.

You can't scale manual operations.
You can't grow reactive decision-making.
You can't maintain chaos.

The real question is:
What system do you need first?

For most organizations: planning, tracking, or alignment.

Which one's your bottleneck?
```

## Framework 7: Data/Statistics Hook

**Best For**: Authority building, credibility, surprising insights

**Structure**:
```
[Surprising statistic or data point]

[Context: why this matters]

Here's why this happens:
→ [Reason 1]
→ [Reason 2]
→ [Reason 3]

The solution:
[Your approach]

[Results or proof point]

[Optional CTA]
```

**Example**:
```
73% of founders and executives work 60+ hour weeks but can't explain where the time goes.

No time tracking. No productivity metrics. Just exhaustion.

Here's why this happens:
→ No visibility into actual time allocation
→ Confusing busy with productive
→ No system to identify time leaks

The solution:
Objective productivity tracking with daily scoring.

I went from "I think I had a good day" to "I know exactly what worked and what didn't."

Data beats feelings every time.
```
