## 2. Color Palette

The Arise color palette balances trust and warmth. Deep navy anchors credibility while warm amber provides the guiding "light" that represents clarity and transformation.

### Primary Colors

| Color | Hex | Use |
|-------|-----|-----|
| Deep Navy | TBD | Anchor color, credibility |
| Warm Amber | #E8914F | Guiding light, transformation |
| Gold | #F5C26B | Accent, highlights |
| Soft Teal | #2D7D8A | Secondary accent |

### Neutral Colors

| Color | Use |
|-------|-----|
| Warm White | Backgrounds |
| Soft Cream | Content backgrounds |

### The Arise Glow (Signature Gradient)

This gradient is the brand signature—it represents the transformation journey and the "arising" concept. Use it as accent elements, backgrounds for key visuals, and highlight treatments.

**Gradient**: Amber (#E8914F) → Gold (#F5C26B) → Soft Teal (#2D7D8A)

## 3. Typography

Typography balances authority with approachability. Modern sans-serif fonts communicate technical competence while remaining warm and readable.

### Font Families

| Type | Font | Weight |
|------|------|--------|
| Headlines | TBD | Bold |
| Body | TBD | Regular |
| Accent | TBD | Medium |

### Type Scale

TBD - See original document for specific sizes.

---

## 4. Illustration Style

The illustration style is **"Warm Tech"**—sophisticated technical detail rendered with human warmth. This differentiates Arise from cold, generic tech imagery while maintaining credibility with technical audiences.

### Core Principles

**Technical + Detailed**
- Isometric or subtle 3D perspectives
- Visible systems, flows, and connections
- Precise line work, intentional compositions
- Abstract representations of AI, data, and systems

**Warm + Human**
- Rendered in the warm brand color palette (not cold blues/grays)
- Soft shadows, not harsh
- Occasional human figures (stylized, not photorealistic)
- Organic curves mixed with geometric precision

### Illustration Categories

| Category | Visual Approach |
|----------|-----------------|
| AI Audits | Magnifying glass + system diagram |
| Chatbots | Conversation flows, friendly bot figure |
| Automation | Gears + flowing processes |
| Strategy | Roadmap, compass, horizon view |
| ROI | Ascending graphs with Arise gradient |

### Reference Inspiration

Draw inspiration from these brands, but execute in Arise's warm color palette:
- **Linear's** gradient spheres + precise aesthetic
- **Stripe's** detailed isometric illustrations
- **Notion's** warm, inviting feel
- But with MORE detail and technical sophistication

## 5. Content System

The content system enables infinite unique variations while maintaining brand consistency. Every piece should feel unmistakably "Arise" while being tailored to its specific topic and platform.

### 5.1 The Generative Formula

Every piece of content is built from four layers:

**Layer 1: Fixed Elements (Always Present)**
- Color palette (never deviate)
- Typography system
- Logo placement rules
- The "Arise Glow" gradient as accent

**Layer 2: Pillar Modifiers**
- Consulting visuals
- Development visuals
- Education visuals

**Layer 3: Topic Variables**

Each piece gets a unique focal illustration based on the topic:

| Topic | Visual Concept |
|-------|----------------|
| AI Audits | Magnifying glass + system diagram |
| Chatbots | Conversation flows, friendly bot figure |
| Automation | Gears + flowing processes |
| Strategy | Roadmap, compass, horizon view |
| ROI | Ascending graphs with the Arise gradient |

**Layer 4: Format Adaptation**
- Blog thumbnails
- LinkedIn posts
- Case studies
- Presentations

### 5.2 Content Templates

#### Blog Thumbnail Formula
- Warm white or soft cream background
- Detailed topic illustration, 60% of frame
- Bold headline in navy, max 6 words
- Subtle Arise Glow gradient accent
- Small logo or wordmark in corner

#### LinkedIn Post Formula
- Clean background with subtle texture or gradient
- Spot illustration or icon, centered or left-aligned
- Value-driven headline, large
- 1-2 line supporting text if needed
- Branded footer strip or logo

#### Case Study Formula
- **Hero**: Abstract or atmospheric illustration representing the transformation
- Metric callouts in accent colors
- Client logo (if permitted)
- Clear "before → after" visual narrative
