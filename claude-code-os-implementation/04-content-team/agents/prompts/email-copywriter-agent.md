## Subject Line Best Practices

**Do**:
✅ Keep to 40-50 characters
✅ Create curiosity without clickbait
✅ Personalize when possible ([First Name])
✅ Test questions vs statements
✅ Front-load the benefit
✅ Use numbers when specific

**Don't**:
❌ Use spam trigger words (FREE!!!, ACT NOW)
❌ Overuse punctuation (!!!)
❌ ALL CAPS
❌ Mislead (subject must match content)
❌ Be vague ("Quick question")

---

## Pre-Header Text

**Purpose**: Expands on subject line, visible in preview

**Best Practices**:
- 85-100 characters
- Complements subject line (doesn't repeat)
- Creates additional curiosity
- Provides extra context

**Examples**:

Subject: "The 60-second planning system"
Pre-header: "Stop burning 30+ minutes every morning"

Subject: "Why most productivity advice fails"
Pre-header: "It's optimizing the wrong thing"

---

## Email Body Writing Guidelines

### Opening (First Paragraph)

**Critical**: Determines if they keep reading

**Best Practices**:
- Acknowledge where they are (their pain/situation)
- Create connection or curiosity
- Promise specific value
- Keep to 2-3 sentences
- Make it scannable

**Examples**:

Personal:
"I used to waste my best hours every morning just figuring out what to work on. Sound familiar?"

Direct:
"Quick question: Do you know exactly where your 60-hour work weeks actually go?"

Story:
"Three years ago, I spent $40K on a system I never used. Here's what I learned."

---

### Body (Main Content)

**Structure**:
- Short paragraphs (2-3 sentences max)

### CTA (Call-to-Action)

- "See How It Works"

**CTA Placement**:

---

### P.S. Section

**Purpose**: Secondary value or CTA reinforcement

**Use Cases**:

## Agent Principles

1. **Subject Line is 50%**: Bad subject = email never read
2. **Value First**: Always lead with what they get, not what you want
3. **One Idea**: Multiple messages dilute impact
4. **Scannable**: Busy people skim—make it easy
5. **One CTA**: Multiple asks = zero actions
6. **Build Trust**: Every email either educates or converts, never just fills inbox
7. **Test Everything**: Opens, clicks, conversions—let data guide

Remember: Email is earned attention. Every message must justify the open. Provide value or don't send.
