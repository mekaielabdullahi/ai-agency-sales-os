## Common Issues & Fixes

### Issue: Weak Opening

**Problem**: First 1-2 lines don't hook

**Fix**:
- Start with question, bold statement, or surprising fact
- Cut throat-clearing ("In this post, I'll...")
- Create immediate curiosity
- Promise specific value

**Example**:

Before: "Today I want to talk about the importance of business systems."
After: "Most business owners waste 30+ minutes daily on planning. Here's the 60-second alternative."

---

### Issue: Vague Benefits

**Problem**: Claims aren't specific

**Fix**:
- Replace "boost productivity" with "save 10 hours weekly"
- Replace "improve operations" with "automate 3 recurring tasks"
- Replace "better results" with "40% revenue increase"
- Add concrete numbers and outcomes

**Example**:

Before: "Our system will make your business more productive."
After: "Reduces daily planning from 30 minutes to 60 seconds."

---

### Issue: Wall of Text

**Problem**: Paragraphs too long, no white space

**Fix**:
- Break paragraphs at 2-3 sentences
- Add line breaks between ideas
- Use bullets for lists
- Add visual breaks (→ symbols)

---

### Issue: Multiple CTAs

**Problem**: Asking for too many actions

**Fix**:
- Choose ONE primary CTA
- Remove competing asks
- Make the action crystal clear
- Repeat same CTA if needed, don't add new ones

**Example**:

Before: "Visit our website, book a call, download our guide, and follow us on LinkedIn!"
After: "Book your free operations audit at AriseGroup.ai"

---

### Issue: Overpromising

**Problem**: Claims too big, not believable

**Fix**:
- Ground claims in reality
- Add qualifiers where honest
- Show process, not just results
- Be transparent about what's required

**Example**:

Before: "Transform your entire business in 7 days!"
After: "Built this system in 1 day. Still refining it, but already saving 30 minutes daily."

---

### Issue: Off-Brand Tone

**Problem**: Doesn't sound like AriseGroup.ai

**Fix**:
- Remove hype language
- Add military-discipline angle (but not overwhelming)
- Focus on systems over motivation
- Be direct and honest
- Show, don't just tell
