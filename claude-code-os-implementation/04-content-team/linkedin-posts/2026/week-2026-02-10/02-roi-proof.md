## POST (Copy-paste ready):

$5,000 investment.

$73,900 in annual value created.

3.5 week payback.

Here's what we actually built:

THE CLIENT:
Service business. 3-person team. Owner in the field all day.

THE PROBLEM:
Every customer call required a chain of handoffs:
- Customer calls owner
- Owner texts office manager (often via screenshot)
- Office manager manually enters into CRM
- Details get lost
- Owner doesn't trust the system

Result: 4-6 phone calls per day just to sync information that should flow automatically.

THE BUILD:

30 days. $5,000. Four components:

1. AI phone system (Quo) capturing every call
2. Auto-sync to CRM (Jobber) - no manual entry
3. AI summaries so office manager can act without callbacks
4. Single business number replacing 5+ personal phones

THE RESULT:

| Before | After |
|--------|-------|
| 4-6 handoff calls/day | Auto-generated requests |
| Screenshot texting | Direct sync |
| "I don't trust the CRM" | Owner checks CRM first |
| 30-60 min/day coordination | 10 min/day |

ANNUAL VALUE BREAKDOWN:
- Owner time recovered (4 hrs/week × $300/hr): $62,400
- Office manager time recovered: $6,500
- Error reduction: $5,000
- Total: $73,900/year

ROI: 1,378%

THE LESSON:

Small business AI isn't about chatbots or fancy tools.

It's about removing the friction between where information enters and where it needs to live.

The boring stuff—phone calls syncing to CRM—is where the money hides.
