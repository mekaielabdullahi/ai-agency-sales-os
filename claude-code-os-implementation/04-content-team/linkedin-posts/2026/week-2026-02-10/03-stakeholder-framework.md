## POST (Copy-paste ready):

The owner said: "We need better phone handling."

The operations manager said: "I spend 5 hours a day on email."

The field tech said: "Training takes 120 hours of the owner's time."

Same company. Three different problems.

Only one was on the original project scope.

THE FRAMEWORK:

After running discovery for AI projects, I've learned: interview everyone who touches the work, not just the person paying.

Here's the process:

INTERVIEW 1: The Decision Maker
- What problem do you want solved?
- What does success look like?
- What have you tried before?

This gives you the "official" problem.

INTERVIEW 2: The Operations Person
- Walk me through your actual day
- Where do you lose the most time?
- What tools do you hate using?

This reveals the hidden time drains.

INTERVIEW 3: The Field/Frontline
- How do you get information?
- What slows you down?
- What do you wish the office knew?

This exposes the communication gaps.

WHAT CHANGES:

| Source | Problem Identified | Time Impact |
|--------|-------------------|-------------|
| Owner | Phone chaos | 5 hrs/week |
| Operations | Email overload | 20+ hrs/week |
| Field tech | Training burden | 120 hrs/new hire |

The "phone chaos" that started the project?
Fifth priority by actual time impact.

THE LESSON:

If you only interview the check-signer, you solve the problem they can articulate.

If you interview the team, you solve the problem that's actually costing money.

Discovery isn't a checkbox. It's where the ROI lives.

## ALTERNATE HOOKS:

**Hook A (Pattern):**
```
Owner: "Fix the phones."
Operations: "Fix the email."
Field tech: "Fix the training."

Same company. Three problems. Here's how to find the real one:
```

**Hook B (Contrarian):**
```
Stop interviewing decision makers.

Start interviewing the people doing the work.

Here's why:
```

**Hook C (Question):**
```
What if your client's problem isn't what they told you?

After 4 stakeholder interviews, we found the real issue:
