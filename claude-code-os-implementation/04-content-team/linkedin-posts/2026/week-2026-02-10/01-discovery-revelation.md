## POST (Copy-paste ready):

We thought we were solving a phone problem.

We were wrong.

Phase 1 for our client: Build an AI phone system to capture calls and auto-create service requests.

It worked. Calls flowing into their CRM. AI summaries. No more screenshot bombing between field and office.

Done. Next problem.

Except...

THE REAL DISCOVERY:

When we interviewed the operations manager for Phase 2 planning, she said something that stopped the conversation:

"Maybe about four or five hours a day on email."

50% of her week.

10 inboxes.

And we'd been focused on phones.

HERE'S WHAT I LEARNED:

The first discovery call reveals the problem they know about.

The fourth interview reveals the problem that's actually eating their margin.

Phase 1 fixed the squeaky wheel (phones, interruptions, handoff chaos).

Phase 2 now targets the silent killer: 20-25 hours/week buried in email management.

THE NUMBERS:
- Phase 1: $5K investment, $70K+ annual value created
- Phase 2: $10-15K investment, $67-83K annual value
- Combined: 30-40 hours/week recovered for the business

THE LESSON:

Your client's first problem isn't their biggest problem.

It's the one they have language for.

The real opportunity shows up when you interview the people doing the work—not just the owner signing the check.

Deploying AI without deep discovery is just expensive automation.

Discovery turns it into transformation.

Your client knows their problem.

They're usually wrong.

10 email inboxes.

We'd been solving the wrong problem.

What if the problem your client asks you to solve isn't their real problem?
