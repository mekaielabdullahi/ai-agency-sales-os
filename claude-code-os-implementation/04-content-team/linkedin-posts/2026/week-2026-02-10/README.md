## Week Theme

All three posts draw from the same client engagement (large format printing company, anonymized). They tell a connected story:

1. **Tuesday:** The discovery that changed everything (email, not phones)
2. **Thursday:** The ROI proof from Phase 1 ($5K → $70K)
3. **Friday:** The framework for finding hidden problems

This creates narrative continuity for followers while hitting all three pillars.
