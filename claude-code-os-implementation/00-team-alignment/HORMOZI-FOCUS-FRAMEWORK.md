# AriseGroup Focus Framework
## Based on Alex Hormozi's 2026 Millionaire Framework

> **THE RULE**: ONE avatar, ONE offer, ONE channel - don't change ANYTHING until $1M

---

## The Three ONEs

| Focus | Our Answer |
|-------|------------|
| **ONE Avatar** | Large Format Printer Companies (2-20 employees) |
| **ONE Offer** | $5K Operations Automation Phase 1 |
| **ONE Channel** | Cold Email |

---

## Level 1: The Foundation

### 1.1 Know Yourself
- **Knowledge**: AI transformation, operations automation, B2B service optimization
- **Skills**: Sales (5-Questions), n8n automation, AI integration
- **Environment**: 4 founders, remote, weekly syncs

### 1.2 Who We Sell To: The "Kelsey Profile"

Our avatar selection method: **Profession** (technical service businesses we understand)

| Attribute | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| Business | Large format printer company owner |
| Size | 2-20 employees, $500K-$5M revenue |
| Identity | Expert technician who built a business |
| Problem | Wearing every hat (sales, service, scheduling, admin, quoting) |
| Desire | Wants to grow but is the bottleneck |
| Reality | Every call, quote, dispatch goes through them |

### 1.3 What We Sell: Unique Expensive Sticky Air

| Element | Our Answer | Proof |
|---------|------------|-------|
| **Unique** | Operations automation with AI (not generic chatbots) | Competitors do lead gen, we do fulfillment |
| **Expensive** | $5K Phase 1, $15-42K Phase 2 | Priced at 30-50% of monthly problem cost |
| **Sticky** | Retainers for maintenance, optimization, expansion | 70% target conversion to recurring |
| **Air** | Reusable AriseCore modules across all printer clients | Build once, deploy many |

---

## Level 2: The Scale Process

### 2.1 Get Them to Buy - Cold Email Only

**Daily/Weekly Activities:**
- 60 leads scraped/week (Apollo, Apify)
- 15 domains warmed, 30 sends/inbox/day
- 4-touch sequence over 12 days
- Target: 3% reply rate → 6-12 calls/week

### 2.2 Get Them to Pay - The Progression

| Stage | Status |
|-------|--------|
| Helped Plotter Mechanix for reasonable rate | Done |
| Got results (time savings proven) | Done |
| Getting testimonials (Loom videos) | In Progress |
| Ask next people to pay full price | Next |

**Current Proof Point:**
- Plotter Mechanix saves **10-15 hours/week** on operations
- At owner's rate (~$150-200/hr) = **$6K-12K/month in recovered capacity**

### 2.3 Increase Customer Value - 8 Ways

| Method | Status | Details |
|--------|--------|---------|
| Raise prices | Active | Phase 2 = $15-42K |
| Upsell | Active | Phase 1 → Phase 2 |
| Retainers | Active | $2-5K/month maintenance |
| Cross-sell | Later | Additional automations |
| Referrals | Later | Ask every happy client |
| Case studies | Active | Turn wins into marketing |
| Extend lifetime | Later | Ongoing optimization |
| Backend offers | Later | Training, consulting |

### 2.4 Three Pillars Status

| Pillar | Focus Now | Later |
|--------|-----------|-------|
| **Acquisition** | Cold email only | Add warm/content at $1M |
| **Delivery** | Founders deliver | Hire specialists at $50K/mo |
| **Back Office** | Minimal | Formalize at $25K/mo |

---

## Level 3: Keep the Advantage

### 3.1 Current Leverage
**Expertise + Code**
- Expertise: Charge $5K for knowledge that took years to acquire
- Code: AriseCore modules work 24/7 once built

### 3.2 The Woman in Red - IGNORE THESE

| Distraction | Why It's Tempting | Why We Say No |
|-------------|-------------------|---------------|
| New vertical ideas | "But Homestead/Industrial could be huge!" | We haven't mastered Printing yet |
| New offer structures | "What if we did retainer-first?" | $5K Phase 1 is working |
| Content creation | "We should be on LinkedIn daily" | Only case study videos for proof |
| Paid ads | "Let's scale faster" | Not until cold email is maxed |
| Partnership deals | "They have leads ready" | We can't fulfill at scale yet |
| "Better" lead sources | "This new tool finds better leads" | Apollo/Apify is working |
| Shiny tools | "This would automate everything" | Focus on outreach, not tooling |

### 3.3 What We DO

- Cold email to printers
- $5K Phase 1 offer
- 5-Questions discovery
- Case study videos for proof
- Weekly metrics review

### 3.4 Weekly Improvement Loop

1. **Do lots**: Send 400+ emails/week
2. **Get feedback**: Track opens, replies, calls, closes
3. **Compare**: A/B test subject lines, offers, sequences
4. **Find winners**: What do closed deals have in common?
5. **Apply everywhere**: Update all sequences with winning patterns

### 3.5 The Sacrifice

> Outlier outcomes require outlier sacrifice.

| Give Up | In Exchange For |
|---------|-----------------|
| Variety | Mastery of ONE vertical |
| Comfort | Daily outreach discipline |
| Ego | Free audits to build proof |
| Perfection | Ship fast, iterate |

---

## Kill Criteria

If after 1,000 emails:

| Problem | Threshold | Fix |
|---------|-----------|-----|
| Low opens | <20% open rate | Fix subject lines |
| Low replies | <2% reply rate | Fix offer/copy |
| Low proposals | <10% call-to-proposal | Fix discovery |
| Low closes | <25% close rate | Fix proposal/pricing |

---

## The Closer Framework

For discovery calls:
1. **C**larify what they want
2. **L**abel their problem
3. **O**verview past experiences
4. **S**ell the vacation (outcome), not the plane ride (process)
5. **E**xplain away concerns
6. **R**einforce the decision

---

## Team Alignment Checklist

- [ ] All 4 founders can recite: ONE avatar (Printers), ONE offer ($5K Phase 1), ONE channel (Cold Email)
- [ ] Weekly metrics dashboard exists
- [ ] "Woman in Red" list posted visibly
- [ ] Weekly sync includes metrics review

---

## Quick Reference Card

```
WHEN YOU'RE TEMPTED TO DO SOMETHING NEW, ASK:

1. Is it cold email to printers? → If no, don't do it
2. Is it the $5K Phase 1 offer? → If no, don't do it
3. Does it improve our ONE channel? → If no, don't do it

THE ONLY EXCEPTIONS:
- Case study videos (they support cold email)
- Warm referrals (low effort, high close rate)
- Process improvements for current offer

EVERYTHING ELSE = WOMAN IN RED
```
