- Automatic continuity tracking

### 2. Operations Department ⚙️
**Purpose**: Productivity tracking and project management
- Daily productivity assessments (1-10 scale)
- Project status monitoring
- Pattern recognition in work habits
- Objective performance metrics

### 3. AI Growth Engine 🚀
**Purpose**: Strategic advisory and business alignment
- Business operating system definition
- Strategic positioning framework
- Unique value proposition tracking
- OBG (One Big Obsessional Goal) alignment

### 4. Content Team (Magnetic Content OS) ✍️
**Purpose**: AI-powered content creation with 14+ specialized agents
- Multi-channel content creation
- Script generation and refinement
- Content ideation and planning
- Output management system

### 5. HR Department (GPT Express OS) 👥
