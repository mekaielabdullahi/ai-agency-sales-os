## 🚨 Contingency Protocols

### If Morning Planning Fails
**Fallback:** Use yesterday's Tier 2 as today's Tier 1

### If THE ONE THING Blocked
**Protocol:**
1. Identify exact blocker
2. Can it be removed today? → Focus there
3. Cannot remove? → Move to next critical path item

### If Energy Crashes
**Recovery:**
1. 15-minute walk
2. Switch to Tier 3 tasks
3. Administrative work only
4. Permit early stop if score >6

### If Interrupted/Emergency
**Response:**
1. Assess: Real emergency or urgent non-important?
2. If real: Handle, then reassess day
3. If not: Add to tomorrow, return to plan
