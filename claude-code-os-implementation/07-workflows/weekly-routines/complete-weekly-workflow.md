```markdown
# Brutally Prioritized Week

## MUST DO (True Priorities)
1. Ship automation to production
2. Train team on new system
3. Ensure zero downtime

## SHOULD DO (If Capacity)
1. Performance optimization
2. Additional documentation
3. Team celebration

## KILL (Stop Immediately)
1. That new AI tool research
2. Redesigning the UI
3. Adding "nice to have" features
4. Attending optional meetings

## THE BRUTAL TRUTH
You have 40 productive hours. The automation takes 25. Training takes 8.
That leaves 7 hours for everything else. Stop pretending you'll do more.
Focus or fail.
