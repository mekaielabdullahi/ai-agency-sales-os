# Raw Notes Directory

**Purpose:** Store unprocessed Fathom exports from partner meetings.

---

## File Naming Convention

`YYYY-MM-DD-topic.md` → Before processing
`YYYY-MM-DD-topic-PROCESSED.md` → After processing

**Examples:**
- `2025-11-27-weekly-sync.md`
- `2025-11-27-deal-review-linh.md`
- `2025-11-27-pipeline-planning-PROCESSED.md`

---

## Workflow

1. **Immediately after meeting:**
   - Send Fathom link to partners
   - Export Fathom notes
   - Save here with date + topic name

2. **Within 24 hours:**
   - Process using PROCESSING-WORKFLOW.md
   - Extract action items, roadmap updates, decisions
   - Update relevant system files

3. **After processing:**
   - Rename file to add `-PROCESSED`
   - Update processing checklist in the file

## What Goes Here

✅ **Include:**
- Full Fathom summary
- Key topics discussed
- Fathom's action items list
- Full transcript (optional but recommended)

❌ **Don't include:**
- Client meeting notes (separate system)
- Coaching calls (use coaching-call-notes/)
- Personal notes without Fathom export

---

## Cleanup

**Monthly:** Archive processed files older than 90 days to an archive folder if storage becomes an issue.
