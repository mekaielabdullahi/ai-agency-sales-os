0:00 - Mekaiel Abdullahi
I can chill for a bit. I'll just post up in the car for a bit. Okay.

0:06 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
All right. I'm pretty sure Chris has the length. think he'll be over tuned. But yeah, what do we need? Oh, he's still in the huddle. What do we need? I guess he's probably getting set up too. Where are we going to start?

0:23 - Mekaiel Abdullahi
Uh, we need, uh, he needs to download VS code. If he does it, he needs to pull down the GitHub repo, uh, Cloud OS. then after those two basic things, pretty much just follow the installation guide on the OS, right? I'm not sure exactly what it says.

0:48 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Yeah.

0:49 - Chris Andrade
Oh, I don't know if I've got the speakers. I don't think I've used the speakers yet on this thing. Uh, We'll We'll see.

0:59 - Mekaiel Abdullahi
going.

1:01 - Chris Andrade
Oh, I got my speakers. Okay, cool.

1:05 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Sounds good to me. So, so Mikael's got to jump soon, but we're thinking it's best if he walks you through it at first. So he was just saying, we need you to, if you have, well, I'll let him go, let you go.

1:19 - Mekaiel Abdullahi
Well, so the first thing, so the goal, what we're trying to do right now is download cloud code OS, right? Using VS code, and then also auto cloud if we have time. But the first things you need to do to install on your computer are VS code and the GitHub repo of the cloud code OS. I think Matthew sent out the cloud code OS, like link somewhere. I believe it might. Okay. And then if you pull that, the directions on the installation of cloud code OS itself are right there. I'm not sure what they say.

1:54 - Chris Andrade
Yeah, get started, set up the installation guide. Here, I'll just, I'll share my screen.

2:02 - Mekaiel Abdullahi
That was good. I already got it.

2:11 - Chris Andrade
Yeah, Mekaiel, hit me up whenever you're ready. Whenever you're ready to go, just hit me up and then we'll go. Okay, perfect.

2:19 - Mekaiel Abdullahi
I'll be available.

2:21 - Chris Andrade
Either if I'm not on my computer, I can go on my computer, on my phone, like, whatever you're ready. Okay, easy.

2:29 - Mekaiel Abdullahi
Cool. Yeah. And check out the latest, I put, I processed the meeting notes and then I put it in SS Wulsheds.
ACTION ITEM: Schedule SS internal meeting w/ Mekaiel & Matthew - WATCH: https://fathom.video/share/xVRTiBEcFnNybDKikgKZL4tbmacC84Gx?timestamp=155.9999

2:37 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
So you guys can use that too. Perfect. Thank you, bro.

2:42 - Mekaiel Abdullahi
Yep. And then, yeah, I think maybe even, depending on how far we get, maybe set up a meeting for SS, another internal meeting later in the week. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

3:02 - Chris Andrade
The screen's kind of small, I'm not going to lie, I'm driving right now, so you got to go through the whole, so cloud code on, scroll down a bit.

3:17 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Yeah, sorry, don't watch this video yet. I should not put that in the first one. Just go back to the, where you were at before.

3:27 - Chris Andrade
So does it keep coming? Okay, so just scroll down, step by step.

3:35 - Mekaiel Abdullahi
Keep going down, keep going down. No, think you want to install VS Code first, right?

3:43 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
I already got that, I got that installed right here. Nice, okay.

3:50 - Mekaiel Abdullahi
Yeah, I was doing that when we were talking about that this morning.

3:54 - Chris Andrade
So now I was, now I need to go to Claude, right? And download Claude. Yeah, from the GitHub repo, or it should be right there, if you go back.
ACTION ITEM: Update Cloud Code OS setup guide: add CLI, Git Bash, VS Code PowerShell, GitHub auth, repo clone, mobile sync - WATCH: https://fathom.video/share/xVRTiBEcFnNybDKikgKZL4tbmacC84Gx?timestamp=247.9999

4:09 - Mekaiel Abdullahi
And where are we?

4:13 - Chris Andrade
Code Visual Studios.

4:16 - Mekaiel Abdullahi
So you got that?

4:18 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
We got to update these instructions, because it doesn't tell you how to install a cloud code in these instructions.

4:24 - Chris Andrade
Is it that the one that Trent put in on Notion?

4:31 - Mekaiel Abdullahi
Yeah, but I think he's redoing the Notion, so I don't know if those videos are still there. It is.

4:39 - Chris Andrade
I'm playing it right now. Okay. I'm playing it on my laptop. So, oh yeah, I need to install GitHub, right?

4:57 - Mekaiel Abdullahi
Yeah, you got to get home. I don't know if you do, Ted, and stuff.

5:02 - Chris Andrade
It's a part of do you have a GitHub account?

5:08 - Mekaiel Abdullahi
I think so. Yes, I do.

5:13 - Chris Andrade
Well, GitHub is just needed to, you don't need it.

5:20 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
I don't think you need it to install cloud code OS. You just need to, you need to set up an anthropic account if you don't have cloud already. Well, you do need GitHub to run it like on your phone. If you want to do it mobily, then yeah, you're going to need GitHub extension.

5:40 - Mekaiel Abdullahi
Yeah. And then, do you have a cloud account, Chris?

5:52 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Oh, you're on mute, buddy, Chris. Oh, sure.

5:55 - Mekaiel Abdullahi
Sorry, my wife was talking to me.

5:57 - Chris Andrade
Um. . . . . All right, so yeah, it looks like I already have all my GitHub, I think I've accepted to your repositories.

6:09 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Yep, yep. So now we need a cloud account.

6:14 - Chris Andrade
All right, so go to my cloud account, go to I do have... Yeah, I paid for the...

6:29 - Mekaiel Abdullahi
The one that connects to...

6:37 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Yeah, they just added in the browser, that's cool. But, so now just ask it, how can I install cloud code CLI?

6:48 - Chris Andrade
On my Windows computer.

6:50 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Thank you.

6:51 - Chris Andrade
Thank you. One, two, three. Yeah? you. Thank

7:00 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
No, it might be better to do this with a cloud desktop. You can install cloud desktop. That's what Trent uses.

7:07 - Chris Andrade
Where, uh, how do I get native windows installation?

7:15 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Because this is going to walk you through all this stuff. Ask it, how can I install cloud desktop?

7:24 - Chris Andrade
Whoops. Oh, I did it. Bro, this is like, kind of weird. Like, I'm, this is still new to me. Like, like, asking something to get installed on my computer, I can't still comprehend that quite yet.

7:46 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Yeah, once you get cloud code CLI going, you'll, it'll have a click.

7:53 - Mekaiel Abdullahi
I have to stop myself from doing it manually. Like, if I do it manually, I'm like, Matthew. doing it! Don't watch me and be like, bro, just tell it to tell it.

8:03 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Why are you typing, bro? Yeah, and then typing is a whole other thing and then that's another question. So what's this ARM64? Oh yeah, . I don't know. I never know. I think it's either 64 bit 32 bit, but...

8:19 - Mekaiel Abdullahi
I mean, that means the bit rate of your...

8:26 - Chris Andrade
And I think, shouldn't we be running off of 32? I would say 64.

8:32 - Mekaiel Abdullahi
I always do 64.

8:43 - Chris Andrade
Which one? Or this one? What do you think, Mikil?

8:52 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
ARM64?

8:54 - Mekaiel Abdullahi
Sorry, what was that? Yeah, I always do 64. Okay.

8:58 - Chris Andrade
I got this what you said. Let's And

9:02 - Mekaiel Abdullahi
Hey, guys, I'm going to have to help, but I'll be back as soon as I can be. All right. Thanks, Mekaiel. I'll link up with you guys in a bit. That sounds good. Thanks.

9:15 - Chris Andrade
Oops. I appreciate you walking me through this, Matt, because this definitely will help me. It will clear a lot of my mental fog. Yeah, for sure.

9:28 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Yeah, we've been behind on this, but we're finally doing it.

9:33 - Chris Andrade
Installation has failed while installing it.

9:38 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
I might be the wrong one, but can you open the setup log? Oh, yeah. See, I don't have a Windows, so there's going to be some Windows stuff that you know better than I do. Yeah, that's why you're... The image is invalid, but it's for machine type other than current machine. Okay, yeah, try to do the other one then, not the ARM64.

10:09 - Chris Andrade
Oh, gotcha. Okay.

10:14 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Okay, so the worst that happens if you pick the wrong one is it just tells you it didn't work at the installation. So I'm never going to look that up again. I'm just going to click real quick.

10:28 - Chris Andrade
I wasn't sure if was like, that's on the computer or like.

10:33 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
That's funny.

10:36 - Chris Andrade
Oh, yeah, that one, that one definitely initiated. Nice.

10:42 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Okay, so it gets too renewed. Yeah, so this thing will have like access to your desktop. So I think it should be able to just, you ask it to install Cloud Code CLI and then it'll just do it.

10:59 - Chris Andrade
That's So like this is legit a fresh computer like not the only thing I've got installed on here is um Adobe. Okay, I wanted to see how it was gonna interact with uh.

11:14 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Cool.

11:16 - Chris Andrade
Sure. Yeah, turn on shortcut. Yeah, leave that on there.

11:20 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Do you know how to use like voice to text on your windows? Is it all and the asterisk or like this? I don't know. do you do it? I don't know. Maybe ask. Oh, yes.

11:41 - Chris Andrade
Two. One. Two. Two. Two. Two. Two.

12:08 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
So it wants you to use the Claude one, but ask it, like, how can you use the built-in Windows one? That's so bad, don't think there even is a Claude built-in one.

12:36 - Chris Andrade
Windows, oh, let's see, Windows H, oh , that's cool, that's how you do it, alright, thank you, sir.

12:48 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Okay, so just, maybe just tell it, like, this is a brand new computer, can you help me install Claude Code CLI? Yeah, this is a brand new computer.

13:00 - Chris Andrade
Can you help me install Cloud Code UI? Yeah, CLI.

13:07 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Oh, CLI?

13:09 - Chris Andrade
Yeah.

13:11 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Dude, this is crazy.

13:14 - Chris Andrade
Turn on automatic punctuations and settings. Bro, this is going to change my life. Yeah, the voice to text thing is crazy.

13:27 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Like, I do that every time I go for a walk, I just talk and I just say all my stuff.

13:34 - Chris Andrade
So, you said Cloud CLI? Yeah, it gets it wrong every time.

13:39 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
It gets its own name. Well, no, that's the Windows. Yeah, Cloud is like C-L-A-U-D, Code C-L-I. Yeah. Honestly, even if you said Cloud Code, it would probably know what you're talking about. Okay. Typos kind of matter less, so my spelling is going to work, honestly.

14:03 - Chris Andrade
I love how Grok makes you like, when you talk to Grok, he calls you a dumbass pretty much.

14:13 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
I don't know where it's at, Milo.

14:15 - Chris Andrade
I don't know. I don't know.

14:30 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Can you ask it? Can you do it for me? I'm just curious.

14:38 - Chris Andrade
I don't know where you're at, Sam, either. And you don't need that right now. Okay, no. can't get reinstall and Peter don't have access to Windows. we have however we can walk through the window. so Windows are... Oh yeah, so I had to go in. This is where I had to install Bash, too, on the other computer. Copy and paste this command.

15:21 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Yeah.

15:28 - Chris Andrade
Both of the monitor mounts, or whatever that you want to return, do not need to be returned. They don't want to return them? They just give them to us? And they give us their money back? Yeah, so that two images, and then the... I don't know how Amazon makes money, bro. The TV mount. The TV mount? Yep. So, well, I've got me a pair of jeans that don't fit because I lost... So they're like, oh, no, here, keep the $100 pair of jeans, and we're going to give you a $50 gift to take a gift so you can get the $50 discount to get on your other pair of jeans for $50. And then I got two monitor mounts, and they're like, keep them, here's your money.

16:20 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Yeah, just think, like, so two things is, like, they have this AI recognition system that's just, like, these guys don't cheat ourselves. System, like, they, they, like, you know, they just return stuff every once in a while, so it's all good, pretty much. Because there's some people that will cheat the system, but then they don't give them free stuff, like.

16:42 - Chris Andrade
Oh, because of our, like, yeah, because we don't do it often, so they're like, oh, I see.

16:49 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Yeah, and then the lifetime value on that must be crazy for them to just give you, like, the gift card and stuff. Yeah, so.

16:59 - Chris Andrade
So. So I push enter, I can't see the left side, is it doing something? Oh, you can see, so you only see half my screen?

17:13 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
No, I can see the whole screen, but just the very left is cut off of that command prompt. Interesting.

17:19 - Chris Andrade
Okay, yeah, so I just got, oh yeah, so it's saying I need to get dash. So let me stop. Can you see, can you see that now? Yeah, but the left is still cut off a little bit.

17:41 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Really?

17:43 - Chris Andrade
Yeah, pull it to the right a little bit.

17:45 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Or, yeah, yeah, I can see it all now. You can go a little left.

17:53 - Chris Andrade
I why it's cutting it off like that. I don't know.

17:56 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Yeah, just the very left, like. Like. Can you see that right there? Yep. Yep. Okay.

18:03 - Chris Andrade
So Windows required Git Bash. So I click on this link, right? If installed. So it gives me a link to Git.

18:13 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
I would say, I would say copy and paste this whole thing and send it to Claude and see what it says, because it might be a faster way.

18:22 - Chris Andrade
I saw you when you were talking to Mikael when you sent me your Fathom. He said, click on here.

18:29 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Click here, hold, shift. Yep.

18:34 - Chris Andrade
And click there. Boom.

18:36 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Okay. Yeah.

18:38 - Chris Andrade
See how when you teach, bro, I listen.

18:42 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
I love it. Yeah. Yeah, that's key. Like I use that all the time now because it's just like, you know, I drag and lose it. Yeah.

18:54 - Chris Andrade
So go and get installer. should be detected or run installer. Beautiful. down двor. And Bye. Okay, so boom, open link, Arm 64, that's the one we just tried to get, right? Yeah.

19:20 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
what does it say?

19:31 - Chris Andrade
It looks like I got two, I got a standalone installer, a portable, oh, thumb drive. Okay, so I just want to use the standalone 64 x64 setup.

19:43 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Yeah, I think so. Yeah.

19:49 - Chris Andrade
Should I copy this and so we can update the instructions to that one GitHub that we have?

20:04 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Yeah, put the link in this Google Meet, and then I'll use this Fathom recording to update the instructions.

20:14 - Chris Andrade
Oh, gotcha. Okay. Yeah, we got to get that.

20:22 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Yeah, I think it would be helpful for that.

20:25 - Chris Andrade
And then, so now let's go. There's nothing special. I just want to just follow the prompt, right? Just keep like I don't need to do it.

20:51 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Yeah, pretty much. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Can you go back to one more and then do the override default name? I like main better than friggin Oh, gosh. Okay. Yeah. All right.

21:35 - Chris Andrade
Okay. Okay. That's fine. That's fine. Okay. And bundle open SSJs or external?

21:50 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Yeah, for whatever the default is. Yeah.

21:55 - Chris Andrade
Use native window. Yes.

21:59 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Yeah, I'll just...

22:02 - Chris Andrade
Okay, yes. Fast forward, yes, yes. All right, so some catching. All right. So this is what Git, Bash?

22:17 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Yeah, this is Bash.

22:19 - Chris Andrade
So I had my modem, bro, for like three years, and I've reset it, and it's like my son, like, apparently, like, modems don't last more than two or three years? Is that? I don't know.

22:35 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
haven't had to change. Do too much about hardware like that?

22:39 - Chris Andrade
I don't know the hardware that much, yeah. Okay, so, okay, so it looks like I got my Bash running, so now let's come back. After Bash install, new prompt, important, close the old, and open. Oh, so close this prompt.

23:13 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
So you open the command prompt by going to the search in the windows and then typing CMD? Yep. And do you need to run that as administrator or no?

23:26 - Chris Andrade
I'm already logged in as admin. Yeah.

23:30 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
So I'm already logged in as admin.

23:32 - Chris Andrade
And then, so now I come here, let's hit copy, paste.

23:42 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
So copying the curl command from that Claude gives you. I'm just saying. That's true. Yeah. No, that makes sense. I like it.

23:55 - Chris Andrade
Again, these are these visual, not only visual cues. Now we need to add the. I they've Audio queues in our everyday text, you know? Yeah, yeah. So then my plan here, Matt, is if I can get this office to do these recordings so I can automatically get these transcriptions and then, like, obviously through Fireflies is one aspect. I mean, how do you feel, what would be the best way to successfully install? So this happened before, so installation complete. Okay, yeah. So then now, do we? Can you just type and see if that works?

24:56 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Okay, so now copy and paste this whole thing and and. So you And send and give that to Claude and be like, I just, yeah, you don't even have to really prompt it. just kind of copy and paste it. So just from here down? Yeah, whatever you just did, the whole thing is fine. Okay. The whole thing. Okay. They don't filter out the noise. So pretty good. So.

25:28 - Chris Andrade
Do you have anything? By the trash bin. Because it's not, let's fix it. I have to do this last time. That's weird. Yeah, think, I think you do got to do this.

25:54 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
I've done this before recently. Okay, so I go, I need to tell you. I'm just going to say for the transcript, but so cloud code installed successfully, but windows can't find it yet because the installation folder isn't in your path. So we're going to fix that by adding cloud code to your path. So open system properties by pressing the windows key plus R, is it? Yes.

26:26 - Chris Andrade
Okay. And then we're going to type in S Y S D M period C P L. Where do you do that?

26:36 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
I'll get that part. Uh, what's that?

26:39 - Chris Andrade
Where do you do that?

26:41 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Oh, you already did that? Yeah.

26:43 - Chris Andrade
So that's where I typed this S Y S. Oh, okay. So, and then it brings up the systems and then systems properties and then advance click environment. Advance performance. performance. Thanks. In the top section, user variables, find path, top section, find the select path, why is it on OneDrive? Oh, path, okay, wait, and, is this, I'm confused, yeah, I think that's right, and then you click edit, find the path, click edit, click new, yeah, and this, for you Now, we getting pick one one, two. Now, how look process. Wow, it does. needs to be enforced. you. you. Where did you say something?

28:07 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
I think now you've got to click new again. There you go.

28:10 - Chris Andrade
Okay. Yeah, I like, I thought I clicked it. Okay. Click okay on all windows. Okay. Okay. Okay. Restart command prompt. Oh, I'm going to go. Oh, it's not. getting good. Okay. So now.

28:44 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
This is a new one, right? You didn't? Yeah. Okay, cool.

28:48 - Chris Andrade
So now we opened up a new. Woo. There we go.

28:56 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Dude, that was fast. Let's go. Good . Good stuff. So now we want to go into VS Code, right?

29:06 - Chris Andrade
Yeah.

29:08 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Yep. And then you see those top things up at the right that say like the right one? Yeah, close the right one and then open the bottom one. So close this one? Yeah. And then open the bottom one. Yeah. And now type Claude and let's see if that works. I don't know if it will. Yeah, freaking PowerShell, dude. I don't know this. So you see on the on the right? It says PowerShell. There's like so many different shells that you can use. We could ask it. Let's just do this right now if you're okay with that. Do you have time to get up?

29:57 - Chris Andrade
Oh, yeah, dude. This is like, this is what That's I need to get done today, so yeah.

30:02 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Okay. Let's just, can you copy and paste this output into cloud desktop and just, or actually, actually go back to the command prompt that you had open and let's connect it. So just hit enter for dark mode, unless you want something different. And then cloud account with subscription, yeah, just hit enter. So now it'll authorize through here. And then back to the command prompt. And then hit enter again. So close this window, you can't close this window.

30:52 - Chris Andrade
And go back to command? Yeah, just go back to the command prompt, yep.

30:58 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Yep. Yep. Yep. Enter. Enter again. Okay, so now you're on, you got cloud code running, and you're on Opus, no, you're on Sonnet 4.5, which is fine. So now just pay, actually, no, tell it, I opened VS Code, and I opened the default power, default terminal PowerShell, and I saw this error when I'm trying to run a lot of code.

31:30 - Chris Andrade
Okay, so, I, oh, been, oh, shoot, I did not put your sign outside. I'm sorry, sure, sure, I got it right here. You want me to go, hang it, where do you want me to put it up outside? I got the tape, though, I can go put it outside. Okay. morellers. later. you Jon. Bye. Bye. Thank you. Well, can I finish this and then I'll go over there? I opened VS Code and tried to run quad. This is... Put it in PowerShell also.

32:25 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Oh, quad in PowerShell?

32:27 - Chris Andrade
Yeah. Is that one word? And this is the error code that I got.

32:49 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Yep. All right. Let's let it run. I'll come to figure it out, bro.

33:00 - Chris Andrade
Do you want to proceed? I would do yes and don't ask again.

33:07 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Yes and don't ask again. So now, yeah, yes and don't ask again again. So now it'll know. Go ahead, do your thing. You got it?

33:26 - Chris Andrade
Okay. You already stole those. Oh, I've had this. Okay, so let me close VS Code. Let me close this down. How do I get it? Close the upper right one, I guess.

33:45 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
And just restart VS Code all entirely. I think this literally happened last time too, bro.

33:51 - Chris Andrade
If I'm correct.

33:53 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Okay, yeah. And then...

33:56 - Chris Andrade
you.

34:07 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Let's go, there you go. Okay. So now you got Cloud Code installed. It's running in the PowerShell on VS Code. We can start doing the Cloud Code OS installation now. What is this? Yeah.

34:22 - Chris Andrade
Do you allow public-private network? I think you want to allow, yeah. Okay. So now we got this good. Now we got it. I can close my terminal, right? Yep.

34:39 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Okay.

34:39 - Chris Andrade
And then we already got, this is our bash. Yeah, but just leave the Google Meet open.

34:48 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Okay. So the Google Meet on this one. So let's see, we're going to walk through the... This cloud code OS, what we're going to need next, I think Chris will be back on soon, so ping the link, what what up, what My bad, wrong button, I put it wrong button.

35:37 - Chris Andrade
All right, so let's go back here. So you saw that link? Yeah, so I was like, okay, this is the link that we were working on, right? And I was like, oh wait, I don't see Matthew anymore.

35:52 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Yeah, so just go past now, you can go past the cloud code CLI launch.

35:59 - Chris Andrade
very much. Thank

36:01 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Yeah, see, need to update the instructions to say, pull in, once you install the CLI, we need to pull in the, it's telling it how to set it, yeah, I need to adjust the instructions. What do you want to do, actually?

36:15 - Chris Andrade
just talk it out, and then we'll use this transcript in this meeting, and then we can use it, update the instructions from our transcript. Okay, yeah.

36:25 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
So right now, the setup and installation markdown file says to launch Cloud Code CLI and then generate your system structure using the transcript from the YouTube video, but we've already generated the, the Cloud Code OS GitHub repository has already generated itself, so we don't need to generate it from the transcript. What we actually need to do is copy and paste the GitHub link to Cloud Code OS. So... So... Chris, can do that just by click the link up top, and then just copy the whole thing. It's fine, actually. And then take that over to VS Code. And let's just, let's see, make sure the cloud code thing is, I, yeah, I wouldn't use this one. Oh, yeah. might, maybe you, you can try it out later. Maybe you can use it, but I like the terminal one. Hey man, I want to learn your method, bro.

37:37 - Chris Andrade
Okay.

37:38 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Cause the terminal one, you can, you can create like multiple and then you can like move it around and stuff. But if you have that thing, you, I don't know. It's kind of annoying for me. Personal preference thing though. But yeah, at the bottom right here where you have cloud code, what does it say? Yeah. think you're just going to hit enter. Yeah. So now paste what you just copied, and then we're going to delete the end of it. So just delete the end of it all the way through Blob, like delete Blob also. Oh, so keep the OS.

38:16 - Chris Andrade
Yeah.

38:16 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
So now we have the GitHub link to Cloud Code OS. Now hit space, and then tell it, like, let's create a new project in a workspace folder using this GitHub repository. Yep, and then hit under.

38:55 - Chris Andrade
Oh, repository.

38:58 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
It'll figure it out, but yeah. I wanted to have like a new workspace folder and then so you can have a workspace folder that has all your repositories in it. It said documents or just workspace at the root. I would actually do under current directory, under Chris, under your user home directory. Go ahead.

39:31 - Chris Andrade
And that's another thing that I'm kind of trying to figure out is how to, like, I want to make sure that I know where is at. So where would that be?

39:47 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Go to this PC. It would be under Chris actually. see, yeah, local disc C.

39:54 - Chris Andrade
Go ahead. Go ahead. Go ahead. Go ahead. ahead.

40:11 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
I would also move this window that you're clicking around to the left side, so you can do both at the same time.

40:19 - Chris Andrade
So you want to proceed? Oh, yeah. So, so whenever it says like, do you want to proceed?

40:26 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
And then it says yes, or yes, don't ask again. Like, if it's something that's not destructive, I'll just say yes and don't ask again. If it's something destructive or something that's going to like push to the GitHub repo, like git push, I don't want to say don't ask again. Because I don't want to just be pushing, you know, with reckless abandon or destroying, like removing files.

40:54 - Chris Andrade
And this is because this is like on my OS, right? Like I'm messing around with. to get repo. Thank The operating system. So I, for me, it's like a, I'm a little timid. So there's some fail safes in place.

41:08 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Like when you start Claude, it'll have access to your current directory, but it will always ask you if it needs to do something outside of that directory.

41:19 - Chris Andrade
So that kind of keeps things safe. Would you like to open a setup guide on any specific parts of this project?

41:28 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Let me read it. it's saying, well, first, do you know where this is now? On the left side, you have your local to see, yeah, it should be in there. There it is.

41:43 - Chris Andrade
Okay. So I'm going, yeah. So if I want to pin this, so I know where it's at. So now, okay, cool. Awesome. Nice. Cool. Yeah.

41:56 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Okay. Now I know where that's at.

41:59 - Chris Andrade
Awesome. Awesome. Now, so every time I am, like, when I, my workspace, what is this workspace? What is this? So can you click it and open it?

42:14 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
So yeah, so this is like the bare, this is the bare bones. So now you've installed the Cloud Code OS, bare bones, just like the operating system setup. So it's got instructions how to build out your, your company operating system. The framework is set up for like an AI agency. So it's good for your use case. I think for other businesses, we're probably going to need to adopt it a little bit to their business before building it out. So like, cause right now there's like a folder structure. If you go inside Cloud Code OS implementation. adopt you of does Then continue Ida, That's There's executive office, operations, AI growth engine, which is stuff that probably all businesses could use, right, just at a high level. But then there's also content team, which I don't know if everybody's going to need a content team. Nowadays, a lot probably will.

43:17 - Chris Andrade
Yeah, I mean, we will get, just think of quantum mechanics, right? Joe's is content team, right? For SMS, we'll ship. Alex is their content cream. Dink, Matthew does too. Yeah, yeah.

43:32 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
And then, so there's HR department, knowledge base, workflows, open workflows real quick. So this is like, yeah, this is like the, so this is the productivity side of the Cloud Code OS. So it's like, it's like, it's, these are sort of like slash commands you can run within, OS like.

43:59 - Chris Andrade
Yeah.

44:00 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
That will walk you through a daily assessment. So how did I do today? Like, imagine you're talking with this OS every day and you're like, I did this. Like you go for a walk and you're like, I've done this today. Help me plan out the next part of the day. This is what I do all the time. This is how I use it. And, and then like at the end of the day, this is what I need.

44:25 - Chris Andrade
Yep. It's, it just gets you all organized and then how do I, you know, so what's, so do you, do I want to open that file from that deal or, yeah, you don't have to look at this right now.

44:39 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Um, so this is, yeah, now let's set, let's set it up. Cause we got to set it up first. Okay. Would you like me to open set up better? Help, just say like, help me set it up for my use case. And then remember to use the voice to text thing, because that'll just speed everything up.

45:08 - Chris Andrade
Oh, so I can use that in here? Yep. Man, what was that command? I think it was H, something H. When was it? Look at you guys, you're good! All right, how can I... I don't want this guy to go away. Can... Where do you... I want them to stay right here. Where's my widget? All right. So improve daily... So now it's walking you through setting it up.

45:45 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
So it's asking, what's your primary goal with Cloud Code OS? Oh, wow.

45:51 - Chris Andrade
Holy . This is like... Uh, improve daily productivity and planning. That's what I definitely need work.

46:00 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Software Development, Content, Business, Entrepreneurship, dude okay how is this walk me through this bro like seriously like so you created this right no this is something that Darren uh from the community from the AAA community created um so all I did was I uh I extracted the transcript from that YouTube video where he talks about it right he walks it through walks you through it and um and then I pulled I asked Claude CLI to like give you like give me a um oh what's it called just give me a repository with the stuff and I guess it like it pulled enough information where it created this so now it's just yeah it's just gotta set up guys just walk me through it uh But he created the one with some initially.

47:03 - Chris Andrade
And then, so number five, where it says type something, that's like something like you could enter your own personal thing in?

47:11 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Yeah, like if you didn't think these were good ideas or something, you could type an alternative, basically. That's usually how it works.

47:20 - Chris Andrade
So how do I get, so... You hit enter? Submit answers. Dude, this is... So listen, Matt, while this is going, like, this be something that we can charge clients for. And then that's like an added feature. Once they understand why we need this, then we can charge them to manage it. Yeah. Right?

47:50 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
We could, we could. We could even set it up for them and just have them. Like once they see the value, they're going to... Put all their stuff in there and then that gives us the process map of the business so like that gives us once they start using it we're going to understand their business so much from all the context that they feed it is there we can even offer it for free if they want to use it like you know interact great I'm assuming now we're setting this thing up so I can interact with my OS right like for my daily journals and my tracking and so on so forth yeah can I interact with this on my mobile yeah yeah so there's another workflow we're going to need to connect your Claude online account to your github account so we can do that now while it's working actually okay Where do I go so there's Google Claude.ai, and in the upper left, do you see the code one? So yeah, can open sidebar, and there's code, click that, and that's what you're going to do on mobile also, but what does it say? Yeah, I want to continue.

49:28 - Chris Andrade
Do you want to create my OBGMD? All edits during the session? Yeah.

49:37 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Can you scroll up and see, just look at what it's creating. So this is my one big obsessional goal.
ACTION ITEM: Define OBG for Arise Group OS; update OBGMD - WATCH: https://fathom.video/share/xVRTiBEcFnNybDKikgKZL4tbmacC84Gx?timestamp=2983.9999 So this is like the strategic foundation. So like...

49:54 - Chris Andrade
Oh, so this is something that I got to put some thought into. you? No, no. Yeah? Yeah. So...

50:00 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
I think now might be a good time to do that, or you can just let it create the files structure right now, and then you can add it in later, like you can think about it, can write down the files, you know, that's fine.

50:13 - Chris Andrade
Yeah, I think I would like that, because once I, let me get the OS installed, and then if we can walk through how to interact with it, can we do that during that interactions session to get back to here?

50:28 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I got time, we gotta speed you up, this is what I'm doing right now. One, I would do allow all edits.

50:41 - Chris Andrade
Okay, just let it build it out, and then we come back to it? Yeah. All right, so now I'm back over to my cloud code.

50:51 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
So do start cloud code web.

50:55 - Chris Andrade
Okay. Okay. Okay. you. I would try. continue? Okay. Yeah, connect to get home. Oh, thank you, love. Hey, come say hi to Matthew. Come say hi. Say hi, Matthew. Hi. Hi. How are you? Hello.

51:15 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Good to meet you.

51:18 - Chris Andrade
Hey, Matthew, say, have a good day. Okay, you're crazy. Yeah, I smell it. Okay. You got me something? I got it right here. Thank you so much. I'll keep it forever. Okay, bye. See you later. The false name.

51:56 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Default is fine. I have network access. Let's do trusted Trusted?

52:03 - Chris Andrade
Name it trusted? No, no. You can just leave it as default, I think.

52:07 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Oh, okay.

52:07 - Chris Andrade
Click untrusted. Yep. Yep. Yep. Whoa. Is this a whiteboard?

52:18 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
So now this is cloud code in the web. So like it's connected to your GitHub. So you can now, well, yeah. So click select repository right there on the, on the left.

52:32 - Chris Andrade
Okay.

52:34 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
So now you can, you can like work with my OS cause you have access to my OS. I gave you access to my, there's like an architectural plans builder that I've been, uh, one of my friends had the idea and I started building something out. Um, plotter mechanics is right there. I just pushed the recent updates so you can try this. So go to hit plotter mechanics. So in order for the cloud one to access your recent updates, you need to push it to the cloud. So like once we're like you're what you're setting up right now in cloud code OS is not pushed to the cloud yet. So gotcha.

53:17 - Chris Andrade
Yeah.

53:18 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
So that's why it doesn't show up there as a repository, but the plotter mechanics one, I pushed it to the cloud. So now, you know, the discovery call unknowns, there's like a checklist and questions. So just ask it, like, what are the current unknowns and checklist for discovery? I need to ask Kelsey next.

53:46 - Chris Andrade
And type it in here. Yeah. in here. Okay. Yeah. Oh, . What happened? Oh, wrong button. Windows 8. What are the current. And what are the checklist items that are left to be completed?

54:19 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
So I would erase the extra stuff that I did.

54:41 - Chris Andrade
My wife, my sister got drum sets. Oh, yeah.

54:46 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Nice.

54:58 - Chris Andrade
Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. So what are the checklist items that are left to be completed? Anything else?

55:06 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Yeah, I would ask it, I'll be a little more specific and just ask it like, what do we need to ask Kelsey, Nikki, and like the team this week? Like... Oh, I see.

55:21 - Chris Andrade
Yeah, based on like the discovery... ...interview to help us understand everyone's daily routine. Oops. Sure.

55:47 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Let's see what it comes back with, but so now this has access to that repository.
ACTION ITEM: Install Claude mobile app; connect to Arise Group OS repo - WATCH: https://fathom.video/share/xVRTiBEcFnNybDKikgKZL4tbmacC84Gx?timestamp=3357.9999

55:54 - Chris Andrade
Whoa! So I can reference what you've been working on? go. Okay. you. Yeah.

56:02 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Yeah, exactly. Like, whatever I push, right, once it's pushed, then it's available. And also, you can pull this up on your phone now. So now, if you install Claude mobile app on your phone, and just log in, you'll have access to the same thing on your phone.

56:22 - Chris Andrade
And I interact with the repositories through this feature. So, okay. So what is this, the same, what is this one? What's this development OS? What's that?

56:40 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
That's the one that I use. So I called my Cloud Code OS AI Agency Development OS, because it's like, I'm focused on the development side. So, actually, I'm going to recommend that you rename Cloud Code OS to something that you want to focus on, like, whatever, whenever you decide.

56:58 - Chris Andrade
Like, my date. Yeah.

57:11 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
And you can change the name later. So whatever, if you want to change the name in the future, you can. But like, it does that stuff as part of like a bigger goal. So it's like the AI agency operating system, right? Or like, so just think of whatever name you want. you can, you can do whatever you want, really. But so I think it's completed.

57:36 - Chris Andrade
Dude, this is cool. This is so cool. Oh, man, I'm like nerding out right now, bro. This is okay. Help me define my what was OBG? What does it stand for? One big obsessional goal.

57:55 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
So what they say in the network is like 50,000 revenue per month. For the AI agency is like a good first milestone to hit. So that's what mine is going to do right now. Okay. Hold on.

58:08 - Chris Andrade
got, uh, hey. Yes. Dart passed away last night. Who? Dart. You're kidding me. Uh, no. When I tell you about custody. Sorry. Dart passed away. Yesterday. Right. Oh, man. Uh, what? It's full of cancer, and that's exactly what Scott Passmore has. Wait, Scott Passmore has cancer now, too? Yes. I know. I didn't know that. that. I I I I know You Well, yeah, okay. That said, well, do you know, you don't know any of his family or anybody though, right? No, I know that the sign opened up a lot in between Williams and, what is that? Polbrook? Polbrook. Somewhere over there. Okay. All right. I'll call you back. Love you. Love you. Wow. That's the biggest dealer. We were number two. He was number one. He just passed away. That's crazy.

59:49 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
That was really sad.

59:51 - Chris Andrade
Yeah, he was a, he was a, he rubbed the people, a lot of people the wrong way though. Like it's like, he got. same. I don't understand this mentality of like working against each other not with each other. It just doesn't make sense to me. So you're saying that in the group we have are a big obsessional goal that everybody's like kind of committed to? Yeah.

1:00:28 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
And I mean, you can define their own. Like, I think for us now, I might even update mine to be like 1 million revenue by the end of 2026, right? Or, you know, we don't need to save by a certain time, I think. Just like, what's the big goal? I think a number helps.

1:00:55 - Chris Andrade
But it can be whatever you want.

1:00:57 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Like you can, you can make one now. No. No. No. And modify it later. The thing is, when you make whatever you make it to be, and then we start building out more stuff, it'll like reference that. But like over time, it'll get like everything else will get adjusted.

1:01:18 - Chris Andrade
So it looks like this has been installed on my computer now.

1:01:26 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Yeah. So it's, it's got a bunch of stuff built out. I didn't even see everything that it's, it has built up, but we'll be, we'll, we need to build out more stuff, uh, still right now, if you have time.

1:01:36 - Chris Andrade
Okay. Um, so let me, uh, Thank you. I think we can do it.

1:02:15 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
I think so, too. Alright.

1:02:22 - Chris Andrade
Whoops. Oh, yeah. You have to actually syntax this .

1:02:33 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Yeah, sometimes it helps. Sometimes it doesn't matter. Nowadays.

1:02:39 - Chris Andrade
So now it looks like this completed my deal. And so is when you guys make your fancy slideshows, are you taking what this spits out and pushing it to gamma or something to that? I'm sorry. Yeah, usually it's like that.

1:03:03 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
But what we do is what like what we need to do, what we need to make sure that we do, because it all sounds really good, right? But what we need to make sure that we always do is review as many details as possible of the output, because it'll get things a little bit wrong, like here and there, and that will affect the later output. Like, for example, right here, it says phase one blockers, job or plan level, need to check with Alyssa. But it's like, no, we already know that it's the connected plan. So there's just like little things like that, where we can just tell it with a prompt very easily, as long as we do the review step, like review it, tell it like this needs to be corrected, that needs to be corrected. And then it comes out better. And then sometimes it takes a few steps. couple iterations of it. Yeah. Same thing with coding. doing. Thank By the way, and then, and then like, yeah, and then but eventually it does get to a thing where it's like, okay, every line in this is like, really good. Let's now put it to a presentation and get them up.

1:04:14 - Chris Andrade
Mike, look at these questions that asking for Alyssa. Yeah, like, these are perfect, dude. Where's Mickey? Let me see Mickey's mic. Who's we might doesn't even need to be in here. Mickey's not in here. . So it's looking like it's referring Mike as an employee, which we gotta turn that Mike is just Mike, any Mike is a customer, you know what I'm Oh, okay.

1:04:54 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Because this is the Mike who we set that that we did the plot.

1:04:59 - Chris Andrade
I those. love those. the he went over and set up that printer for it okay it was like during the in the transcript yeah yeah okay i thought i wasn't actually sure myself i thought that was uh an employee so i got that wrong yeah so uh let me just go ahead and i will update my let me actually put this update mike update mike to be then like how would you say that uh update i would just say like i would just talk to it like you can even you should use the voice to text thing and just say like you know mike is whatever and then just go okay damn Update Mike to be only referenced as a customer not it's not good I think I it up with the settings okay I think I get it and then uh why try it again maybe it'll work now just update Mike to be only

1:07:11 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
And you can do multiple updates at one time, and it'll understand. So like, you can say like, we know that they're on the Java Connect plan, for example.

1:07:27 - Chris Andrade
Oh, I see what you're saying. Like, add multiple things to fix in one. Gotcha. I see. So then, Mike needs to be erased from the plotter mechanics jobs or responsibility list. Thank you. you. you. Thank you. you. Thank you. It's so weird, like, to think about how or what to say. I don't know. So let's just see what that comes from. So it took a while to process all this. And so I'm assuming it won't have to go too far into it again.

1:08:24 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Yeah, this should definitely be way quicker. then, you know, anything you can think of from reading, like sometimes the first kind of like output, I just do I just say like a few things to review, and then it'll correct a bunch of stuff. And then the next time we'll need to do less. But sometimes the first time if it's getting a lot of stuff wrong, I'll just say a bunch of feedback, and then it'll go in and fix everything up. Okay. I think the goal is like less iteration. So I always think the more detail that I can provide as a review. I see.

1:09:04 - Chris Andrade
Well, this is cool. Okay, so now I'm up to speed on being able to touch what you were working on or like how to see or interact. So that's cool. Now, looks like my OS accept edits, what it looks like, welcome to building the Arise group tool and let's make it happen, generate my, so now what's, so now how.

1:09:29 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Now, want you to, I want you to push this to a new GitHub repository so that later you can, you can access it from your phone and work on it from your phone, right?

1:09:38 - Chris Andrade
Cool. So, and then, so I go back to GitHub?

1:09:41 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
No, no, no. Leave that cloud code open and then go to the, on the right NVS code, just tell it, create a new GitHub repository and let's work through that because that's going to take some time. In this? In this?

1:09:55 - Chris Andrade
In Okay. as you think.

1:09:57 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
So like push this project. To a new GitHub repository, and make it private.

1:10:18 - Chris Andrade
Bro, like... I can't... We're going kind of fast.

1:10:31 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
So...

1:10:34 - Chris Andrade
One of my communities with the PCI DSS background, the cybersecurity, a big thing for these guys was... Check if GitHub CLI is installed. Yes. A big air code bash... So I'll get home, and then we're going to to... It's great. Bye. While it's working, the big deal, GitHub and Create Automatically, a big deal with these guys. building a brand is very important to these types of people because of the fact that they have to sell themselves as a cyber security expert, right? Yeah, okay. And a part of how they do that is they will use a GitHub repository to show their builds or their methodologies and be able to say, hey, we'll review my GitHub account. Yeah, that makes sense. And so the people who actually built the GitHub repository were very successful. That's The ones who didn't do it, there was a lot of user error, and so they never did it. And I feel like this would be so helpful to so many people. Yeah, just getting them set up.

1:12:23 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
I don't know why it's, I don't know what git add my workspace does, but let's just see where those, it probably is doing all right. Yeah, I think that's right. So it's going to create it with, yeah, it's going to have to authenticate, so it'll walk you through that. And then it should give you a link. Yeah, I mean. Yeah.

1:12:59 - Chris Andrade
Yeah. Yeah. Oh, how should it, how, what email should I use for the git commits? My, my main email, right? Yeah, think your GitHub account, yeah, yeah, yeah, what should it mean, Chris, right, dude, this is, like, this is just so crazy to me, I mean, your actual address, Okay, so now I'm going to type something, go down to that one, I think you need to use the keyboard to go down to it.

1:13:58 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Yeah, I used to do that too. to do it. need to have my GitHub looking good for, like, software work. Yeah.

1:14:07 - Chris Andrade
I mean, it looks like, like, I mean, it's just, this is why I want to kind of start doing this is because I feel like once we get our comfortable and we can start pushing, like, I can start reaching out to my community. Yep. I don't know what possibilities are there, but in order for me to be able to reach out, I need to have a brand to cater to, you know, and the Polymath Guild serves at least a platform. But the Arise group is where I need to point to. And we still have a bunch of social present work that we need to do on that front as well. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

1:15:00 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
100%. And I think Mekaiel has a good hold on that. He's been thinking about that for a while. So I think it's best if you guys work together on that for now. I really want to work on it too. But I need to focus on delivering the solutions for now, at least.

1:15:20 - Chris Andrade
That's why it's why we work so well together. just, uh, alternatively, you have created a repository. If yes, provide the repository. It's in the URL to your code. Wait, what did it say?

1:15:36 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Your changes are committed now. Let me create a private and push your code since automatic installation needs interaction. Let me download CLI directly. Let me take a simpler approach. Guide you through creating. Just ask it like, no, no, ask it, uh, so it went off the rails a little bit there. Uh, can you just ask it? Like, can you please install. we got all... hope Or can you please set up the GitHub repository for me? What went wrong? like, yeah. Sometimes it just will give up. But we gotta like, tell it... Could you hear that phone ringing, by the way, on my side?

1:16:20 - Chris Andrade
Yeah. Yeah.

1:16:24 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Tell it, like, can you please... What did I say? Can you please create the GitHub repository for me? Let me know if there's any issues. Let me know if there's any issues and we'll work through them. But I want you to do it. Yeah. Yeah.

1:16:57 - Chris Andrade
Love it. So just talking about Fathom, Matthew Kerns, Chris Andrade, Abdullahi, 12kernsmatthew.

1:17:31 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Matthew Andrade, Mekaiel Abdullahi, 12kernsmatthew, Matthew Kerns, Andrade, Mekaiel 12kernsmatthew.

1:18:00 - Chris Andrade
Okay, control Y. Maybe Windows button click. Yeah, I got it. And then continue. Yep.

1:18:17 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Shoot. So go back, pull this to the left side so you can still see it and then go click on VS code and do. Oh, there's the code right there. See it? I think you can copy and paste that one.

1:18:32 - Chris Andrade
yeah, yeah, yeah. Oh, yeah, I got it right here. D3353D8D.

1:18:48 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Yep. And then scroll down and just, there's one more button you need to click. This one? Authorize?

1:18:54 - Chris Andrade
Yep. Yep.

1:18:56 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
There you go. See, now it's found out. Now your GitHub CLI is connected and authenticated.

1:19:06 - Chris Andrade
Yup. So now I can interact with my Arise group deal through my phone as well.

1:19:21 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Let's set up your phone first and then you'd be able to, yeah. Can you pull on your phone, just install Claude? I think I already have that installed.

1:19:34 - Chris Andrade
Oh, cool.

1:19:35 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
And it's connected on your account, the same account and everything?

1:19:38 - Chris Andrade
Yeah. Maybe not. I guess it kind of renamed it.

1:19:57 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
It put Cloud Code OS Arise group. Yeah, I did. Okay, I think you have to do this, yeah. Once you do this, it'll be pushed.

1:20:16 - Chris Andrade
It says Claude has memory. Now Claude makes relevant connections across your chats. It says use memory or don't use memory on my phone. Definitely use memory. Okay, it looks like I am set up on. Yes, look. You guys are leaving? Yeah. Wait, where's Cameron? Oh, you're just going to do your turn. Okay. All right, sweetie. I love you. Can say to mom? Okay, so mama. What? Do you need a mic? Do Okay. Do you know where they're at? Okay. Be very careful. Okay, go to my account or settings.

1:21:14 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
You're in your app. Can you see how we did chats and then code on the desktop?

1:21:22 - Chris Andrade
Yeah, it says installing cloud. You guys are reading? Yeah. Okay, let me. Installing cloud code on my windows. That chat, like the recent chats. Yeah, so on your app, what do you see?

1:21:34 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Just recent.

1:21:36 - Chris Andrade
It just says, let me see. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1:21:42 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
So click on code. Click on the code one. Okay.

1:21:46 - Chris Andrade
And then... Okay. And then the existing environments default?

1:21:54 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
I think so, yeah. Or trust network device. I would do the default, I think. I don't know. What does it say? Yeah, that's the one you set up, so just hit continue. Okay. That was the cloud environment you set up on your computer.

1:22:16 - Chris Andrade
Oh, yeah. So now I see Plotter Mechanics' code is in here. Nice.

1:22:24 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
So that's the chat I think you have open on your desktop with Plotter Mechanics. So then now I want you to do a new session. Can you do a new session on the cloud?

1:22:36 - Chris Andrade
select repository. Yeah, and see if the Arise Group OS is on there.

1:22:42 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
No, not yet. All I see is Matthew still.

1:22:45 - Chris Andrade
It's still mauling. Really? Yeah, it's push code to private entry, but push is still running. It's running. Right now. Insane. What is happening?

1:23:04 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Can you go down? Hit the down arrow?

1:23:16 - Chris Andrade
Yeah, click there and then hit the down arrow and then enter. Click. Hit enter to review task. Yeah, hit enter again.

1:23:37 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Okay, hit escape. I mean, yeah, that should not take two minutes, so it's thinking right now. Oh, there it goes.

1:23:48 - Chris Andrade
Yeah, uh, tell me to stay. Stay. Okay, so. Now Github's asking me to sign in, sign in with my browser, right? Yeah.

1:24:10 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Okay. Yeah. Go ahead.

1:24:16 - Chris Andrade
What's this ego system? Authentication succeeded. Perfect. Okay. Okay.

1:24:27 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
said it worked. So, so now check again on your phone and let's see if it's there now. I think it's there.

1:24:38 - Chris Andrade
Let me close out. Maybe. New session. No. Not yet. I don't know there yet. said he exited. Yeah. me close it up. So, new chat, no, you go to code, new chat, select repository. Still not there. Because it would just show up, right?

1:25:35 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Yep. Let's see.

1:25:39 - Chris Andrade
You exited the app, and then it's still not showing?

1:25:42 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
That's so weird. Okay.

1:25:49 - Chris Andrade
Let's see. Wait, can I go to, should I go to GitHub? Should it be in here now?

1:25:55 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Uh, scroll down to, no, it should be in there, yeah.

1:25:59 - Chris Andrade
Oh, yeah. There it is.

1:26:00 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Okay, so go down your app, in your app, scroll, when it says choose, when you're in the choose repository screen, scroll down to the bottom. And then does it, does it say connect more repositories? Yeah, well, it says install cloud on GitHub.

1:26:17 - Chris Andrade
And then it does say select repositories, choose repositories from your cloud session on the top. So then I hit that, and then let's see, let's just type, I should be able to just to type arise group, right?

1:26:36 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Yeah, I see one that says connect more repositories, and then I click it and it says connect repositories, there's a button. Okay, let me sign it.

1:26:48 - Chris Andrade
I think that's what I have to do, actually. So I'm doing that right now. Okay.

1:26:55 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Link account.

1:27:02 - Chris Andrade
Yep, there it is.

1:27:05 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Sweet.

1:27:09 - Chris Andrade
So now, I'm in my code where I can talk about, hey, I need to, because I need to call the AZ event group lady right now and then ask for an update. Yeah. So I'm like, okay, I just talked with Amy with AZ events. She scheduled a meeting for Tuesday next week. I can talk to that in the here now?

1:27:37 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
I think so, but I want to check first in the VS code if all that's set up, because there might be some more stuff that needs to be set up, but I think it will work right now. And you can try it. I don't know.

1:27:52 - Chris Andrade
You want me to go find her? Give me one second, Matt. All right. Yeah, go for it. second.

1:27:59 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Yeah. Go. Go. Go. Go. Go. Go.

1:28:01 - Chris Andrade
She got a little better than I was doing. Okay. you. Love you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Okay, you there? Oh, I'm going to the cuff. Thank you.

1:30:51 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Okay, Matt, sorry, I got some coffee.

1:30:54 - Chris Andrade
I'm back.

1:30:55 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
All good. All good. Sounds good. Thanks.

1:30:59 - Chris Andrade
Thanks. Yeah, because if I can start figuring out if I can go to something like this, and if I can just talk to one certain thing about all the customers that are in the pipeline, our pipeline, and then ultimately, yeah, that would make my life so much easier.

1:31:20 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Can you actually, on your phone, just tell it that right now, and let's see, just see what it says. So just, you got to be connected to the repository in the code thing. Yep, I'm there.

1:31:34 - Chris Andrade
Okay, so. And can you do voice to text on your phone too?

1:31:38 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Yep, so I'm going to talk to you right now.

1:31:40 - Chris Andrade
Okay. I would like to set this up in a way that I can create a dialogue on this channel and reference a particular client that I am. Wanting to create a note or an idea to expand on, then to keep track of. How do we set this environment up to cater for that type of workflow? Oh, do I hit enter? No, that's bringing me down. Oh, okay. So when I hit enter, it just like drops another bar down. So how do I hit go? I don't know.

1:32:59 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
don't know.

1:33:00 - Chris Andrade
But see how I have it typed out, and then I push enter, and it just drops it down.

1:33:07 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Yeah, so copy what you just put in there, like highlight it all and hit copy, so you have a copy of it, so you can paste it anywhere. I, sometimes it bugs out, so I like to do this sometimes when I think it might be bugging out, and then, so you don't have to restate it, you know.

1:33:26 - Chris Andrade
Yep, yep, yep, smart, get copy, and then, what is, select, okay. So I'm just going to come back. Yep, okay, interesting, okay, so it looked like there is. Is it working? Yeah, oh wait, no, this is Kelsey's. Why did it go to Kelsey's? Okay, this is for planning. Okay, so. Lil Lil Lil Lil New session, water, apology, select, okay. Describe what I want to build, okay. So yeah, like I'm hitting enter, right? Like I'm going to hit enter?

1:34:16 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Yeah. On mine, I don't hit that enter button. It's weird because on mine it's like an arrow that's like, Hey, tell me my daily schedule for today, December 29th. So if I say something like that, like you can see there's this orange arrow and I hit that button. I don't have that. I don't see that in yours.

1:34:46 - Chris Andrade
Yeah.

1:34:47 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Are you, can I see your screen? New session. What is, what is that button on the right? This one. don't know about

1:35:01 - Chris Andrade
Yeah, what is that?

1:35:05 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Okay, now click code.

1:35:10 - Chris Andrade
So, yeah, so it brings, so it's going to bring it back to the new session. So I'm going to click new session. Okay. And then it shows the poly, the poly, right? What the heck?

1:35:22 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Okay. Yeah. Yeah. Select. And then what, what does it do? Yeah.

1:35:27 - Chris Andrade
then, so it brings me back to the same, so I'm going to paste what I just said. Okay. Right. So I pasted it and then I'm going hit enter and it just literally just hits return on the menu, which is weird. I've never had that happen before. Usually I have to hit.

1:35:49 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
That's super annoying. And this is an Android phone? Yeah. Maybe try just exiting the app and opening it again. Okay. Maybe it's just a button. Like, can you kill the session or something? Yeah.

1:36:04 - Chris Andrade
Let me, uh, okay. Killed. I mean, this is all cool for us that we're recording this because, I mean, we're gonna have to walk this through clients too, you know? Yep. So I'm gonna go back now. I'll re-open Claude. I'm gonna go back to Claude and check on code, new session. I see the polymath guild here on the bottom. It looks the same. I don't see another button here. So I'm gonna set paste. Okay.

1:36:51 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Yeah, it is the same.

1:36:53 - Chris Andrade
It's the same thing. It's so weird. Well, that's annoying. I'm the only one on the Android. I got it. An iPhone, let me see.

1:37:02 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
We can, oh, okay. Yeah, I mean, I know my iPhone one works, but I was gonna say, on the Android, we could check for updates. Like, maybe there's an app update you could do.

1:37:12 - Chris Andrade
I mean, yeah, let's check that. I mean, that'd be crazy. But you just installed it, right?

1:37:18 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
I mean, not today, it was like last week.

1:37:21 - Chris Andrade
Okay, well, they might have fixed it.

1:37:24 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
I don't know.
ACTION ITEM: Document Android Claude mobile send/submit workaround - WATCH: https://fathom.video/share/xVRTiBEcFnNybDKikgKZL4tbmacC84Gx?timestamp=5850.9999

1:37:25 - Chris Andrade
Oh, that was, that's it. Yeah, there's no update. Okay.

1:37:37 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
I don't know.

1:37:38 - Chris Andrade
It's so weird.

1:37:41 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
A workaround might be, like, you can go to your web browser.

1:37:47 - Chris Andrade
Yeah. Okay, let's try. And that honestly might be the way we just reference it down the road. the ground. to work Yeah, don't Yeah. Okay, Thank Thank Yeah, the workaround from the app. Oh, yeah, Android. Okay, yeah, we might have to go this route. Yeah.

1:38:13 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Okay, so now I'm going into code.

1:38:17 - Chris Andrade
Okay, I see repository and select. So, oh, there it is, all the to the bottom. Cool. Then I'm going to hit paste. Yeah, it's working there. Sweet. Let's go.

1:38:43 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Workarounds for the win. Or the win.

1:38:48 - Chris Andrade
Okay, so it's, let's say, well, it's pulling it up on, like, I should be able to pull it on here, right? Or how would that work? How, how do I interact? I'm going to turn

1:39:01 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
So, okay, so I wanted you to do it on your phone so that we can we can go through that right now how they stay synced up, right?

1:39:10 - Chris Andrade
So is there a way that I can join this meeting from my phone to screen share?

1:39:18 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Yeah, you can, but I think we need the computer still just because both.

1:39:26 - Chris Andrade
Oh, maybe.

1:39:27 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
My computer.

1:39:28 - Chris Andrade
I don't know. It might make you choose one, but you can try. Yeah, let me, while it's doing this, let me come back into Slack. That's for Ops. Dude, we got like, we got all angles playing right now. Ops, general. Okay. I'm going to sign in with a diff. to with Yeah. Thank So, okay, so I wanted you to do it on your phone so that we can we can go through that right now how they stay synced up, right?

1:40:10 - Chris
So is there a way that I can join this meeting from my phone to screen share? Yeah, you can, but I think we need the computer still just because both.

1:40:26 - Chris Andrade
Oh, maybe. My computer.

1:40:28 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
I don't know. It might make you choose one, but you can try.

1:40:34 - Chris Andrade
Yeah, let me, while it's doing this, let me come back into Slack.

1:40:40 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
That's for Ops.

1:40:45 - Chris Andrade
Dude, we got like, we got all angles playing right now. Ops, general. Okay. I'm going to sign in with a diff. to with Yeah. Thank Frank. Okay.

1:41:06 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Okay. I request you.

1:41:14 - Chris Andrade
Alright.

1:41:18 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
I don't know why it's still echoing. How about now? No, you're good now. Yeah. Frank. got two Chris's in here. Frank. Oh, I know why it's doing that. headsets. Frank. Can you hear me good? Can you hear me good? Frank. Yeah, but it echoed. I know it. Frank. Frank. How about now? That's good. Okay. It's a little strange. I think Google Meet only allows one person to share at a time, but let's see how the phone handles it. Okay.

1:42:33 - Chris Andrade
Cool.

1:42:34 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
So yeah, what is it saying? I'll help you set up a workflow for tracking client, dialogues, notes, and ideas.

1:42:44 - Chris Andrade
Let me first understand the current code-based structure to understand what we're working with.

1:42:47 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Sounds good. So it's got business strategy, content, knowledge base. Perfect. I can see you have a well-structured workspace.

1:42:56 - Chris Andrade
Let me create a client management system. Okay. Okay. Okay, a little early for that, but let's see. I'll create a dedicated section. Where is it creating it? A client registry, Arise Group, Client Management.

1:43:12 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Where is that path, I wonder? It says user CloudCodeOS Arise Group. Can you scroll down maybe a little more? Actually, can you click that green? Oh, my work. Okay. CloudCodeOS My Workspace 06 Client Management. I'm pulling it up right now. Yeah, can you pull up in VS Code? Oh, . It might have done something weird before pushing, so we might have to fix that. Okay, fine. So you see the screen share? Let me see what happens when I try to bring my code. Yeah, it just switches it out. So can you open the file explorer? So if you go NVSCode. Oh, NVSCode? Okay. Yeah. So you know where it is? It's up on the upper left of the VS Code. A little more left, then file, and then down. That first one. Yep. That's the explorer. What the heck? Oh, oh. Do, yeah, do open folder. And then let's go to workspace and just open that one. Yeah. So actually go back and then just hit select folder at the bottom there now that it's selected. So this will open. So from the top and then trust. Yes, I trust the author. So now open up the bottom thing and close the right one like we did before. Yeah. And then type in Claude. So now we have like a new session. So it's saying there it can access everything in this one. So now we kind of need to reset. We need to tell it a bit of the context. So. I'm kind of curious. Just ask it like. Ask it. Tell it like I pushed this project to GitHub. Can you tell me how much of this project is in GitHub? at home? Thank Bye. And then hit enter, and then let's, can you click over to the left under the My Workspace one, NVSCode, the Explorer NVSCode. So there's a, there's like, like if you go, if you see it, I'm trying to look at the files in VSCode. And where do I, the My Workspace one. click My Workspace, where it says like, actually, so you're scrolling on the left in the browser, but I want you to look at the right side with VSCode. So on the left side of that, yeah, then there's, oh, got it. So, okay, so it's done something a little weird, which is it's put all this stuff into My Workspace instead of using Cloud Code OS. That's where it says number six, but we don't see number six.

1:47:07 - Chris Andrade
Yeah.

1:47:08 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
So now it says, so let's look at what Claude said in VS Code because we're going to want to reorganize some stuff and yeah, we're going to reorganize some stuff. So let's go, let's scroll to the top a little bit, or based on my analysis, all your project content is in GitHub. Here's the breakdown, core documentation, complete implementation, your personalized workspace, set up documentation, what's not in GitHub, Claude. Okay. Okay, cool. So just tell, this should be quick, but actually, can you open Claude?

1:48:00 - Chris Andrade
CodeOS implementation real quick. And let's see that. Let's see what's in there.

1:48:03 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
What was this one? No, in VS Code. So the top one. Yeah. Yeah. So now click under, click any of them, actually. And let's just see. It should just have like, mark down. Go to go to the top one, actually, executive office. And then. Open up those folders, just open up all of them. Okay. It looks like it didn't do anything inside here yet. So let's just tell it actually.

1:48:47 - Chris Andrade
So click on the cloud one and just do slash slash model. So on the terminal in VS Code. And then do slash model.

1:49:01 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Yeah.

1:49:04 - Chris Andrade
And then enter.

1:49:07 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
So yeah, go to Opus, because this is going to be a more, slightly more complex ask. So I want to switch to Opus. Enter. Yep. And then tell it, like, I don't want any, I don't want a separate My Workspace.

1:49:27 - Chris Andrade
I want all the stuff that we've done to be inside the folders in Cloud Code OS implementation. Make sure to use the existing structure in Cloud Code OS implementation. I want all the, I want all the work that I have done to be used in.

1:49:56 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Yeah, to be, you want to, we want it to be like. So, let me tell you the idea, and then we can figure out what to type. Okay. So, it's put all this stuff in, like, new folders under My Workspace, Daily Planning, Productivity, whatever. So, but what we want is we want it to be a part of the Cloud Code OS implementation, like, inside the executive office. So, the directory that we, we want to keep the directory to point it to the, we want to call it inside, yeah, not local.

1:50:38 - Chris Andrade
Wait, say that again? We don't, we want to point everything that we're working on to the GitHub repository, not my local.

1:50:48 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Not exactly.

1:50:49 - Chris Andrade
So, so we asked it to sort of, like, start creating, start building out the, the whole structure, right? And it. did that, but it just did it outside of the existing structure. So it thought that was going to be simpler, probably. So we just have to redirect it to be like, hey, like all the stuff we put in my workspace, we actually don't want it to be a separate folder in this project.

1:51:20 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
We want, I want all the stuff that we worked on to be part of the existing structure in CloudCodeOS implementation.

1:51:43 - Chris Andrade
I would say CloudCodeOS implementation because that's the name of the folder.

1:51:48 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Okay, same, oops, it's the same, oops, the same. . Thank

1:52:10 - Chris Andrade
And then before you hit enter, yeah, OS implementation, and then before you hit enter, let's tell it, tell me your plan before you do anything. It's pretty smart. Yeah.

1:52:39 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
mark. Yeah. Sure.

1:52:43 - Chris Andrade
All right. Okay. Yeah. So yeah, Opus is like better at these bigger tasks, like complex stuff.

1:52:53 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
And it uses tokens for that too. And what is Opus? Opus. I

1:53:00 - Chris Andrade
Opus is the more complex thinking model from Anthropik. Gotcha. It's more optimized for complexity, complex tasks, and then Sonnet is like for everyday use, and then Haiku is for like simple. Cool. So it says, I understand, I want everything consolidated into a unified cloud code OS implementation structure, not split across two folders.

1:53:31 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Let me outline my plan, current state, and other sections. Okay. My workspace is going to propose to merge my workspace content merged into... Yeah, I think it sounds decent. Uh, what are the questions? Does this matter? Absolutely. After merge, delete the My Workspace folder entirely. All your personalized work lives inside the main OS One Unified Systems. Questions before I proceed. Does this mapping make sense to you? Should I productively track go under OS Executive Office since it's your personal tracking?

1:54:25 - Chris Andrade
Yeah, that was my question also.

1:54:29 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Can you open up the Executive Office? Oh, you already opened it up, right? So it has Daily Planner Agent. It has, let's see, Productivity Tracking. Tell it. So, can you open up actually 07 Workflows so you can see what I'm thinking? Yeah. So in there, there's like Daily Routines. So... ... ... ... Complete daily workflow.

1:55:02 - Chris Andrade
Tell it to look at the 07 workflows and make sure that's accounted for also with the productivity tracking stuff.

1:55:27 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Make sure that is what? That's accounted for for the productivity tracking stuff.

1:55:51 - Chris Andrade
And then, yeah, now you're good.

1:55:57 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
You can also just type like the rest. No, actually, never mind. Just let it, let it go. So is this what we're seeing here? Is this thinking locally on my computer? Um, yes.

1:56:21 - Chris Andrade
Yeah, because if you're disconnected from the internet, um, it'll run and the, I believe it'll, I believe it'll run.

1:56:29 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
And then anytime it needs to communicate with the internet, like a web search or something that will fail.

1:56:36 - Chris Andrade
Yeah. Cause I've, I've run into that before.

1:56:39 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
So is, is, is this where the computing power is coming into play where like, I have like the beefed up RAM and so on and so forth. Does that come into play for this type of stuff or no? Um, so like, Okay. If I'm sorry. Okay. Yeah. One thing that I've ran into with VS Code and using multiple CloudCode OS, like CloudCode CLI terminals, so you can open, so one thing we haven't talked about yet is you can open up multiple terminals in VS Code and run multiple instances.

1:57:19 - Chris Andrade
Gotcha, gotcha, gotcha. So I can be doing this while working on another one, while tackling another one, and they're all working simultaneously. Yeah, think that's where your extra souped up stuff will help. I see. So when you're running multiple things, iterations at once, that's where it comes into play. I think so, yeah. That makes sense, that makes sense, okay. I think, but I might be wrong because, like on my Mac, I run into that issue with VS Code, where it just crashes at some point. But then when I use AutoClawed, like VS Code crashes. to of Owen, Audio is like

1:58:00 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
So it might be a VS Code limitation, because if you want to run Autocloud, I can run way more at a time, but Autocloud's kind of built for that. Gotcha. Okay. That makes sense. Interesting. Yeah. What is it doing, bro? I don't know why. It's a lot.

1:58:19 - Chris Andrade
It's deciphering. Anthropic is down? Are you serious? So I, dude, I think this is where, I feel like I'm having modem issues, man.

1:58:32 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Oh.

1:58:34 - Chris Andrade
There it goes.

1:58:39 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
So my son, he monitors the network, and we've been having a lot of spikes, like a ping spike.

1:58:46 - Chris Andrade
Okay. And we reset the modem and the router. It's, I mean, I spent $300 on this thing, but I was like, two years ago.

1:58:59 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
So... Hello. So now I think it's got the right context to wear it up. So I'll just tell it, like, yeah, the whole merge plan sounds good, so that we're bringing it back to the whole context. It might already know that, but I'd just like to be... Yeah, yes. Okay, so this way Work7 becomes complete productivity system with both processes and definitions. That makes, okay, yes, do the merge now, right? Yeah, do the whole, do the whole merge now. Yes. According to your plan.

1:59:48 - Chris Andrade
And then after this, do I need to delete? What did it say to delete? I think it'll do it. I think it should do it. It might, it might ask you if it... to see Yeah, Yeah. Looks good now. And then can I delete it? So that's probably what's gonna happen, I think. And then, so now, like, we're, you've, you've worked on something on your phone, right? And you've worked on something on your computer. So these two things are like diverging. They're like, they started from the same place.

2:00:26 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
And then one of them went this way, one of them went that way.

2:00:29 - Chris Andrade
So, we're, we're gonna use your computer to merge them together.

2:00:34 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Because your phone, your phone doesn't, I don't think it can access. I don't know, actually, but honestly, we can we don't, I'll keep figuring this out from my computer, then we'll, I mean, we'll, I'll keep bugging out the phone. Because eventually, we're going to need a figure. Because if Kelsey can iterate with his phone to this event, like it would be night and day, you know, and I know that's just the first iteration of it. So it looks like effectively effective office planning.

2:01:19 - Chris Andrade
So it looks like it's, yeah, it wants to move it over.

2:01:25 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Yeah, it's moving stuff.

2:01:26 - Chris Andrade
I would do yes and don't ask again. Okay. So, just so you know, whenever you say that, go up to the top of the file explorer, you see the .clawed folder, if you can open that one. The, which one? The one you just moused over, it was .clawed.

2:01:50 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Okay. It says like a dot in front, one down. Oh, yeah, got it.

2:01:55 - Chris Andrade
So then open settings. Yeah, open that one.

2:01:58 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
So everything, like the one you just .

2:02:00 - Chris Andrade
So yes and don't ask again, it stores it in this file and it's like, it will reference this.

2:02:06 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
It'll just be like, oh, it's a gitmv command. Like, I'll just do it instead of asking for that one. Interesting. So it looks like, yes. Yeah. Merging business strategies. So when I want to interact with my.

2:02:35 - Chris Andrade
Oh, that's right now. So I guess I'm still a little confused on. We're still building that out.

2:02:43 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
still we're still not at the point of me interacting yet. Right. Yeah. But maybe Mikel, because I know you probably need to go. No, no, I don't go. I think let's get this right first. Brown. Davis. Mike. Cool. I would say if you do need to go, I can just put a pause if you need. Okay. Yeah. Now, I just thought of something that I think we need to tell it. You don't have to stop it, but just tell it, look at the implementation plan markdown file in each folder. So you can hit yes. Yes again, just let it do it. And make sure we're following the implementation plans. And then tell it like we might've veered off course. Yeah. Yeah. I'm bit, but let's make sure that we're building out the operating system. Make sure we're following the implementation plan. We are following the implementation plan. Look at the implementation plan in each folder. There's a markdown and make sure we're following the implementation plan. We may have veered off course a little bit so far. Oh wait, it interrupted you. Do yes and allow all edits. So we may have veered off course a little bit, or however you want to say that. But let's make... Make sure in the, oh, it interrupted you again. Maybe just do, do yes and don't ask again.

2:05:12 - Chris Andrade
And then after you do that, then hit escape, hit the escape key.

2:05:20 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Hit the escape key? want to highlight this to copy it? No, just, just type, hit the escape key on your keyboard real quick. Okay. Okay. And then now it won't interrupt you. So. Oh, okay. Cool. So anytime, like if it's running and you have more instructions for it, you can just hit the escape key. That's a pause button? Yeah. It's like a, it's like a pause button. And then I heard that as a really good tactic, actually, to just get it to know your updated instructions as soon as possible. Okay. We went off course a little bit. So then, yeah, just say like, let's make sure that. Let's In the end, we've followed the implementation plans in each folder to properly build out the operating system.

2:06:29 - Chris Andrade
And then I want to also say, then I want to also say another sentence that's just like, Do I need to put a piece of period?

2:06:45 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Yeah.

2:06:48 - Chris Andrade
So then say like, this is super important for the rest of the time that I work in this project, because we need the operating system. let's get started. Um,

2:07:00 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
to be built out appropriately according to the plans. So this is super important for the rest of the time we work in this project, we need to ensure that the folder the operating system is built out appropriately according to the implementation guide and according to the the original plans for the great general plans. Yeah, think that's good. I hit enter. We have to get it back on track, bro. Yeah, basically. That's cool. Again, I appreciate you sharing. Like, that's very helpful for me. Yeah, because that happens a lot. Like, it will go off track. I'll think it's doing a good job, you know, and I'll just be like, yes, yes, yes. But then really what happened is if we, we don't have to do this now, but if, because also it's, we lost some of the history when we switched folders. But if we were to go back, it told us somewhere that it was going to do this and this and this. And we must have skimmed over it and like, not noticed kind of what it was doing.

2:08:48 - Chris Andrade
Also, it's my fault because I should have said from the beginning, like, we need to just build out the implementation plans.

2:08:56 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Like if you go to the cloud code OS and the. And in your internet browser, there's another one, there's the other tab, or like just the setup and instructions file, I think you have it in another tab. Yeah.

2:09:21 - Chris Andrade
So if you go down past the generate system structure, or actually no, I think it is the generate system structure one. So go back up to the just above. Yeah. So let's see what it says here. It says for each high level folder, create an implementation plan file. Okay, so that's for creating those implementation plan files. So that's what I did to create the implementation plan files. Do you want to change that at all? Yeah, we're going to change it. What would you change it to just for the note taking sake? So we're going to change it to... So include all the setup steps. And then instead of telling people to generate their own system structure, that stuff is already there when they download the repository. So we're just going to go from the build your system step right below number seven right now.

2:10:24 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
I got a response back over here. So it says we have the blueprints, workflows, basic templates in our strategy. It's missing actual folders, structures per plans. Most agent prompts the workers, the templates for daily, weekly, monthly operations.

2:10:44 - Chris Andrade
And then do you want me to build out the complete folder structure and files accordingly into the implementation plan? Yes. I can automatically create everything. Yes? Yeah, I would just say yes. I think it's got it. So So if I If I tab, is it? Oh, yeah, sweet. So if hit tab, it automatically gives me that answer.

2:11:06 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
That's a new one. That's recent. Oh, this is why I love my standing desk, bro. I can't, like, once we get in an office, it's going to be mandatory. Everyone has a standing desk and a treadmill. Yeah, bro. Yeah, that's why the phone, Cloud Code OS, I really want to get you, like, working, using that as soon as possible, because that just unlocks, dude, it literally unlocks creativity. Like, you can walk and think and do this stuff in the sunlight, like, it's crazy. Because, dude, like, I get up at 5.30, 6.00, I'm already out for my hour walk, and, like, I'm just sitting there thinking. I'm like, man, if only I can use my phone to get my to record. Like, started bringing my microphone, but then it's like, I still got to record and upload, and it's just such a pain in. So, yeah. Yes. Yes. Yeah, get it going. It's going to take a little bit. So let's make sure that it stays unblocked there. Because we still got to do one more thing before you're pretty unlocked to work on your phone. So but I can explain it a little bit right now. And then we can do it. Yeah.

2:12:22 - Chris Andrade
So basically, like, your computer has its version. There's a local version on your computer. And whenever, whenever you do stuff on your computer, whenever what I do, like, when I want to go for a walk is I'll tell it, commit all the local changes and push.

2:12:47 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
And like, that's all you have to say, you can all you have to say really is commit and push. But you do want to make sure like all the changes are taken into account. Sometimes if you just say commit, it'll just do the recent stuff. So I like to say commit all recent changes and push, and then once it pushes to the remote repository, then now on your phone, when you open up a new session, it'll have the latest, right? Yeah. And then, so that's key for that direction, but going the other way. So when you, okay, so now I pushed from the local to the cloud to get my phone to reach to it, right? Yeah. Now, when I am working off my phone, how do I push, is it the same, you have to push it from your phone to the repository to get back down to the computer? So, sort of. So they've installed like fail safes. They don't want people to be able to update it as easily from the phone. So what they've done is I'm about plan about the computer beginning Anything that you do on your phone, it goes to a feature branch, so it'll go to, like, a separate branch, and, like, the whole session, it'll work within that branch, so what you have to do is, like, and now the session that you started on your phone, for example, right, is, like, it started from the earlier version of the operating system.

2:14:30 - Chris Andrade
Does that make sense? Yes. So, like, now, that session, we're going to have to merge, it might be a little complicated, so we're going to have to merge that, we can walk through it right now, but basically, like, what I'll do in my workflow is, like, usually try and start a new session, because that will just, Pull from the latest like on your on your phone, just start a new session.

2:15:05 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
And then once you've worked, so the final step of this is like, once you've done something on your phone, it's created a new branch. So then what you tell your computer, once you get back to your computer, that's the only the computer is the only way to merge it all in together. I see. Yeah. And so while you're on your phone, it's there building that branch, building that branch, building that branch. And then when you get back to office, then you go to your desktop top to pull that branch down to the main repository. Yep, exactly.

2:15:45 - Chris Andrade
So that's like a failsafe for auto implementation from the device. It just stores it in its own little separate segregated system for you to actually.

2:16:03 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Yeah, exactly. It'll create its own separate thing so that it doesn't collide, sort of. Got it. That could really cause issues, right? So it's a good thing, I think. And then, yeah, so on a computer, I'll tell you the simplest thing. You just say, like, fetch all the latest branches and let's merge them into main. So that's basically it. And then it'll find all the branches.

2:16:37 - Chris Andrade
So you can work in multiple branches on your phone. Like, if you have multiple different topics, it's a good idea to keep them separate. I guess I'll just have to learn how to switch branches, right? Just to make sure I know what branch is where or what branch I'm on, right? Yeah. Like, if you're going to kind of of Cloud code will help with a lot of that stuff. So if you have questions, just ask the coding agent too. But like, say you're working on like, one topic on your walk, and you're going deep into like, okay, I'm planning my day, for example. And then you're like, Oh, I want to I want to really think about plotter mechanics right now. I might what I would do is probably I would open a new session in that same repository, and then just talk about plotter mechanics. Matt session. Just so it all like, stays kind of organized. So what I'm realizing what we're doing, Matthew here is we're right now, this past two hours that we spent together, we are effectively building out our own version of our tutorial, right, that will be used to save future time. And I think what what you're doing right now is identifying a here my think Thank Another strategy that needs to be documented to bring back to this main one to incorporate what you just said, how to get the phone, like maybe we run a little screen recording session from your phone to attach to this on that particular subject that we're referencing right now is how to pull from branch to branch in our device.

2:18:25 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Yeah, eventually our clients are going to need to understand, like, what we're doing is we're on the client, and you're walking me through this implementation of our to get into my understand my business better. Right. So we're kind of doing like a mock up trial of how this would look at the same time. Yeah, what we're finding is that we may need to introduce a video recording session screen of my phone. To Iterate some of that in this recording, you know what I mean? Yeah. It looks like it's completed. Looks like it has this. Yeah, it did the executive office one. Now it's moving to operations. So let it work. Let's do it. Go ahead. Cool. Yeah. And then this is also Trent's point.

2:19:29 - Chris Andrade
Like Trent has been trying to make this point, too, that like we like using CloudCodeOS, like Mekaiel picked it up, and I think you're going to pick it up, but like clients, the reason a lot of them are hiring us is because they don't like using this technical stuff. I mean, that might shift. But like AI is kind of bringing us all closer to the technology and making it so much easier. Right. Like you can just talk to it and it does stuff, but we still have to teach them this technical step of like, you have to manage this branch and that branch. And it's like, we might be able to design a more user friendly version that, you know, we sell as a SaaS or just another easier way that's not even our custom made product, but it's just whatever works for people. Right. So this is like what's so invigorating about our company, my friend, is that we're not just building tools. We're also analyzing the capacity that that company is able to handle those tools. And then if they're not, they're like, cool, no worries. We'll get you there. And then we'll build that for them. And then when we get them, they're like, OK, now we got you here. Now let's start executing the plan to manage it. Now we're teaching them how to manage it. Right. And then now we. We somebody managing it, now we're like, you know, things are happening, and now we're starting to see the faults of that, and then now we're fixing that, and then we're like, we ultimately, this is what my consulting, when I paid for that, the cybersecurity, is as a consultant, it's very easy to work yourself out of a job. As a consultant, because you're there just to fix problems, solve problems, but if you can solve problems, to not create more problems, but to create opportunities that you can work yourself into a job versus out of a job, that's how you make a successful agency, is like, you just don't try to solve problems, you ultimately try And I think that's what we're trying, that's what we're starting to realize here is that, yes, everybody wants AI. You can most people handle it. No. Are there other options? Yes. What do those look like? Well, the variables are too many to count right now. We're just still trying to understand which one fits you. And that just goes through a process of what we're systematically doing with their onboarding. And then like Kelsey's iteration was cost him $5,000 to understand. Then he's going to say like, damn, well, if I pay 10,000, like look at what I'm going to be getting. Oh, you know what I mean? Yeah. And then once we keep showing them how, what our plan is like, our plan eventually Kelsey is to completely give you your own version of water mechanics digitally, not physically, digitally. Because that's how you repeat success, that's how you can scale, that's how you can grow, right, so I think what we're doing, though, is anticipating that in just in these environments with what you're talking about with Trent, what we're talking about right now, like what we're doing right now, I don't think this is wasted time, because we're going to take this video, we're going to take this transcript, and then we're going to be like, this is this is our tutorial, bro, like now we have a full blown tutorial on what it takes to get the cloud system.

2:23:37 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
And honestly, what other things are we not thinking of that we can push me through to understand other user errors that we're going to have to accommodate. And let's get in front of those. And then let's work out those kings. So maybe that's something we for us internally to think about, okay, cool, we just discovered a So of just by implementing Claude into Chris's computer. And now we're like, what other things are we going to need to kind of do at the same time?

2:24:09 - Chris Andrade
So when the client wants that, I'm like, oh, well, our other client, we had to do the same thing. And luckily, we created this tutorial. And we got this, like, you know what I mean? Yeah, yeah. This is something that me and Mekaiel were just talking about yesterday a little bit, too, is like, it's like, we just need to document everything. Like, we just need to, that's why I had us hop over to Google Meet, because that's what me and Mekaiel were talking about is like, Slack doesn't record the video. So like, for us to be able to send Mekaiel's friend, the video editor, you know, you video content to make the trainings, because he's ultimately going to be the one who's creating the final training video for us, at least Like, for now, but maybe always, because I don't think we want to be doing video editing with our time, right? Well, I eventually, well, this is what I was talking about, Kale, about, like, video editing and video production in general is, like, that's my passion, right? But if you want to do it, yeah. Well, at the same time, if we have enough time, right? Eventually, I eventually would like, like, I want to have our own media production team next door, where I, like, if I want to be able to have a creative video done, I want that internally. I don't want to outsource that, right? Because at the end of the day, dude, that's money in the bank for us, not just for us, but what we can offer our clients. Like, no, no, we have our own media team. I'll schedule that next week, they'll come in, it's an extra $7,000, but look at, look at what we get, you know what I mean?

2:26:00 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
And then we just send a media team to go do what we need to do. And it only cost us three grand, but we're able to charge them eight, seven, you know what I mean?

2:26:10 - Chris Andrade
Because the value of it is so high. And we're all perky solution in it. It's like, it makes no sense. And I love it. And I guess to mess around with the, the, I think like that's, I, and I wanted to, and when I saw that white label and how much it costed us to generate those shorts, that's when I'm like, man. Right? Like same thing.

2:26:39 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
And so I think what you're saying right now using him, because I don't have the capacity to generate these tutorials, like you're saying, I think that's a perfect plan right now to, when, to, we could actually afford a option B, you know? Chris Andrade But I love that long term vision. Andrade Because that's, it's an attention economy. Like that might end up being a huge, one of the biggest parts of the business.

2:27:07 - Chris Andrade
Like we don't know. Right. Well, we'll be like, look at what we did with Quadrant Mechanics. Like had I not had the video recorder, had I not have my mic, had I not have like simple, like my 3D camera or whatever, we like, we would have never known it existed. But because that's how I think, and that's how honestly is what got us in the door, if I'm being honest, was the cameras, the videos, the drone, right? That's what honestly got our street cred, right? Dude, yeah. I think, I don't want to interrupt you, but I think that is so effective and so good that like, as soon as like, maybe even now, but as soon as we have it, like to the level that we want it to be at, I think you should take it to Liam. And be like, dude, like, this is how we're collecting contacts. Like, that's what meant to me to you guys, right? In my first meeting, the very first networking meeting, what made me different? And it was how I came about the deliverables and how I introduced myself to complete strangers. And because of me using my camera to get inside people's businesses, I'm automatically injecting myself into their natural workflow environment. And then with my mic and my mind, I'm able to create our opportunity matrix without having a discovery phone call. And then in our opportunity matrix, we're also giving them some bad- pictures, some bad- videos, and some bad- shots to push on their media channels. And they didn't have to pay nothing. All they had to do was just listen to us.

2:28:57 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Thank you. And then we're like, damn. They did all this, and the discovery call, and it's only going cost me 10. Like, it just makes it easier for them to pallet that deal so we can sell and close it right away. And that's where I think our niche is, is because of what we're doing with the media.

2:29:19 - Chris Andrade
And I really, truly feel like the media is going to be a whole other beast of revenue that can bring to the agency, let alone. Like, that's what I'm trying to think of. The agency is one part, but it can also be other things. It can be a media company. can be a consultation, whatever, implementation, hardware. You need cameras, all this stuff to communicate to your systems. Yeah, we got cameras. We can hardwire your network.

2:29:52 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
You know what I mean? Like, literally, in the age of AI, bro, like. Like, context gathering is everything.

2:30:04 - Chris Andrade
Like, wiring up that context is the next step, but, like, gathering that context and capturing it all, if you've got that figured out with, like, your media, the media company and all the cameras and mics, like, that's the best way, right? That's the best way you can see right now. And I got all that, bro. I already have it ready to go. We just really need to finish this onboarding, which we're pretty getting good at, right? Once we get the onboarding and how it looks in, like, website, pits, all of our communication, like, dude, it's really unload at that point, right, straight up. So real quick, I'm over here. It says that bash command and just keep proceeding. It looks like everything's going right. Yep. So now it's going to build out the content team. So this is what Mikhail is using to generate All right, LinkedIn posts. And Oh, cool. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. So this is where Mekaiel is saying that I needed to work with you to get me to him. And then he said that after we get to this part, he can help me level that up to me where he is. So then now me and Mekaiel would be operating on the same plateau, right? Yeah. So I'm glad that you were talking about this at the meantime, even though we're going to have to do a little bit of editing. But at the same time, maybe we can pull out our growth strategies. Let's just reference the past session that we talked about as our growth strategies. And how does that look for the future as we evolve? Because yes, I want to use Mekaiel's editing guide. And ultimately, I think it's wise for us to have our own editing guides down the road.

2:31:55 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
That's all I'm trying to make aware of.

2:31:57 - Chris Andrade
And the reason is because

2:32:00 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
I think our media component is our niche to make us different from the guys next door because we just are offering a whole other level of services that I don't think they're being talked about.

2:32:21 - Chris Andrade
And that's why I think you're right. Once we get how that looks, how does that play, how does that offer, how does that close help, then we can be like, yeah, Liam, this is what we discovered with using this methodology of our approach. And that's maybe what makes us different because right now we're batting 100. Actually, we're not because Concrete CEO still has not replied back to me, which is kind of weird, by the way.

2:32:48 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
But it gives us the opportunity, it gives us the opportunity.

2:32:56 - Chris Andrade
So it's, it looks like that went good. And then now it's wanting. H.R. Department.

2:33:02 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
This is where I keep my contacts. So whenever I talk with people, I like to store people information in the H.R. So that's a really good reference to tie back into our operating system as a point of what goes where.
ACTION ITEM: Create Loom walkthrough of Arise Group OS folder structure - WATCH: https://fathom.video/share/xVRTiBEcFnNybDKikgKZL4tbmacC84Gx?timestamp=9201.9999 And maybe that's another iteration that we might have another discussion on of like, OK, now we got it moved. Now we got to implement it. Let's actually spend a couple of minutes and go through the folders and say maybe we create a little Loom video on just that. Yeah. And maybe we do that a little bit of that right now, too. I just wanted to rewind a little bit and go to the we're talking about. While you're talking while you're thinking, can I go use the restroom real quick? Yeah, for sure. Yeah, just talk it out, and I'll be right back. Okay, sounds good. So what I'm thinking is like, we need to basically build a case study for plotter mechanics and be like, okay, this is what it looked like before. And this is what it looked like after once we did our whole like media stuff. And then once we, once we can demonstrate, you know, what we did for a client or for multiple clients, then at that point, we take it to Liam and we're like, hey, you know, this is what we've been doing. Or like, even if we just post about it in the community as we go, as we do each one, like, and if whoever's interested in doing that, we're going to get business from whoever. I don't know, maybe I'm getting a little excited by saying, let's go to Liam, because we can just take it more naturally or but I mean, we could just tag him and be like, hey, like, are you doing anything like this? Or or what? Like, if we haven't seen it in his content, you know, we can be the judge of when we, if we decide to reach out to him.

2:35:17 - Chris Andrade
Yeah, I think the important thing is just making sure that we have a solid case study presentation. Because if we get, if can just show like, hey, Plotter Mechanics beforehand looked like this, you know, this was their website, this was their YouTube content and stuff, this was their social media presence, and then after, like, this is what we did in our discovery process, this is what their business looked like before, and this is what we did, and then this is what it looked like after. Then that's a solid, like, case study. We just post about it in the community. You know, people will reply on it. At some point, whatever we think we're ready, we can tag Liam in one of the posts or like something. And I think it would be cool to also have maybe some sort of analytic board on our website to reference how much money we've saved our clients so far. Yes, right. And I think that seeing that ticker live on our website would be a really cool thing to represent, like, at the end of the day, that's why our agency exists, right. And if we can quantify that, or on our onboarding, right, and help me understand if I'm getting this wrong. Um, because this is something that may need to be cleared up on is that our initial discovery call will allow us to provide, not an audit, but a systems analyzation of your current status to even adopt AI. Right? And that's where we paid, Kelsey paid $5,000, right? And during that assessment, we are giving him a very quick win, right? And then in the process of the quick win and the assessment, which is what we just identified by having those interviews with Nikki, with Alyssa and Joe, now we're assessing the workflow of fodder mechanics, right? And then we're tying in these stakeholders to the company to see how they work with the company. Now, Now we have an idea of all the inputs of two plotter mechanics, right? And the employees and how they work and all that. Now we have a pretty good understanding of the operational side of plotter mechanics. Then during the assessment to understand that operational side, I think this is where I need to be cleared up on is how do we get the information in that assessment period that can also be used to build out that ROI calculator. So when like we go for our second contract to implement and from what it looks like they were wanting to tackle the inventory, right? Well, with our second. We now have a good idea of the operational side. How do we get the operational cost equated to build out an ROI estimator at the same time to give them an idea of what just by using this method to solve your inventory problem, right? Now, with our assessment that we took in the first phase or initial phase, now we have a general idea of what the cost association is to not be able to track your inventory, right? And now we can confidently say that you're honestly losing, and in my opinion, not being able to keep track of inventory and parts and things that are coming up that they can't Because they don't have a system to manage all these parts. I know we can kind of get a better idea of what that number looks like. Although it's not 100% accurate. And let's say it's 75%, 60%. Ultimately, they have an idea, and then they know what is to that value, that percentage value.

2:40:27 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
And then they'll be like, well, yeah, this is this is saying that it's, you know, $8,000 that we're losing every month, because we're not able to box up all these extra parts and stuff that are coming. I honestly think that numbers like 2000 and then like 2000. What's that number look like? You know what I mean? So we're, we're able to take the factors to give them to that overall number. And then like, yeah, I mean, here's the factors that we're are cool. We're accounting for to get to that number.

2:41:02 - Chris Andrade
If you don't think it's this number, well, then you think you mess around with it. You say this number is that, you know, and then either it's going to go up or down. Either way, they are now giving their idea of what the cost is. We are just once giving them the capital. And it could just be a simple Excel spreadsheet. Yeah. Yeah. think that would justify any cost that we're asking for. Right. If there's ROI and we thought about the ROI, we've discussed it with them. They've, we are on the same page. We're aligned on like, this is what the business needs the most after our assessment. This is what it needs next. Like these are the numbers and this is why then it's like, okay, yeah, we fully believe we're going to make a hundred thousand dollars. We'll gladly pay you $30,000. Yeah. Like, it just makes sense. And all we're doing is during the assessment, which they already paid for, now we want to know what the business operational guidelines are. Now we can honestly create what I call as my daily operating cost. Yeah. Every day, what are my costs every day, right? Right.

2:42:25 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
So if we take that and ultimately give that kind of idea of what is it going to cost to build this proposal out, and then at the end of the day, we're giving them a spreadsheet of the factors to the ROI.

2:42:43 - Chris Andrade
We're transparent. We're not guessing here. If we go off, we want to know. And then it takes all that out of the – like, where are you getting your numbers from? Where are you getting your numbers from? Well, it takes that out of the equation. Yeah. is what we calculated for this project, this deliverable. Now we did an assessment on your business, so now we have a pretty good idea of where they're coming from, and then ultimately it's going to make them even hone in that number, so eventually we went from a 60% to 70% accuracy, then the next proposal we're like 90, next one we're like 95, now we're at 100, now we know that whatever we're putting into this thing, we're making back in two weeks, six weeks, three weeks, you know what I mean? Yeah, we just get more refined as we go, because we've done it before, but with the experience, we'll be able to refine that stuff and be more and more accurate every time. So Mr.

2:43:42 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
NoteTaker, we're going to have to just make sure that we're separating the conversations out, now we went from having like our growth strategy, now we're talking about our, how we're gathering the information necessary for how office.

2:44:00 - Chris Andrade
OI calculator, which is honestly, I think, is probably one of the most important topics to focus up on, because it should be, I think we have our onboarding pretty good. Now we just need to really focus up on how do we get the information that we need to get somewhat of a calculator built. Right. And then, maybe we incorporate that to when I meet with Nikki. I'm like, hey, Nikki, so this is our plan. We are wanting to incorporate our ROI calculator, because this is how we operate. This is how we justify if we're doing our job, right? This is how we find out exactly how we do our job, how we find out what your business needs the most.
ACTION ITEM: Draft ROI calculator spreadsheet; share w/ Nikki & Alyssa; collect baseline metrics - WATCH: https://fathom.video/share/xVRTiBEcFnNybDKikgKZL4tbmacC84Gx?timestamp=9893.9999 We need numbers. We can't, like, go off of feelings. At some day, at some point, we need numbers. And we don't need access to your financials.

2:45:04 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
I'm not asking for any of that.

2:45:05 - Chris Andrade
I just need you to fill out this spreadsheet that's connected to our drive. So when she fills out this spreadsheet, now we get an idea of her rent, all their costs associated to run that business. Because at the end of the day, they need to know their numbers too. And if they don't know their numbers, then we're doing them a disservice, right? Because for us to do our jobs, they need to know where their money is, how many subscriptions they got. Are they spending, do they have multiple Cox Cable accounts, like internet accounts? Like, you know what mean? Like, we've got to identify because that again, well, we are analyzing or assessing the company in the first two weeks or three weeks, whatever it is, right? Yeah. And we're giving. Giving them a quick win. Right? Yeah. Well, during that process, if we make it understand, like, hey, in order to get to the second stage, that's why we need this information to be filled out, because these numbers are used to generate what we expect on the next iteration. Yes. And then we give them, we turn the tables to them and make them answer their numbers and hold them accountable to really, at the end of the day, the accuracy of the numbers. But what the best part about that is, is that if they're not 100% right, right, at first, and then once they start realizing how powerful our ROI calculator is, they're like, . Well, maybe I should go back in. Let me see how many more subscriptions I got, because I only got like a very few, right? Let me add my Netflix, my YouTube, and all this other , let me actually get down to the nuts and bolts, right? Now we're giving them the power to really understand their business at a whole other level that they never really understood. And like, it's been very aware to me that Kelsey is one of those guys, and my parents are another one of those guys. At the end of the day, they don't have somebody to tell them, you need to know XYZ at the end of the day. And maybe that's where we come into play. Honestly, I need to do that to my mom. Otherwise, again, I'm not, I'm doing her a disservice. I'm not, I'm not just, I don't want to just take money and give them . I want to take money and give them to make them more money to get more , you know? And if we don't do anything other than that. And then we're kind of being what we're not different from the guys, the contractors, the shady ones down the street. And that's why I think if we approach the ROI and that transparency and make them and not only give us the information, once they get the information, they can manipulate the information to what they actually think, not for us to tell them, it's for them. And then they can see, like, I think they're off on this. Let me change this. This number can go up. This number can go down. Damn, with all my, like, I'm really, and they're saying I could get $7,000 back in three weeks, and I only had to give them 10? Interesting. And then it gives them the ability to make decisions. And we're like, so when we ask for that 20, because they need, like, they want to have, maybe that's a component that we're going to need To account for the ROI is the time factor.

2:48:57 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
How fast are they wanting it?

2:48:59 - Chris Andrade
Because that's It's going to go into the effect of how much budget needs to happen for that time, right? For sure. So, like, again, so pointed out, let's call out the factors. So we have the time of the project, right?

2:49:15 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Like, how fast does the customer want it? Okay? If the customer waits, how much is it costing them to wait? Right? Right. Like, all those factors we really need to think of. And that's why I'm so curious that why Liam hasn't really given us the equations to the calculator to build out.

2:49:39 - Chris Andrade
Because I'd be really curious to see what other factors that we can try to account for that were to make that calculator a beast. Yeah. So I don't I don't know how much he's given. I need to look more into that. You guys, honestly. You Dude, like if we really like at the end of the day, that ROI calculator really needs to be our Bible because that's what that's what's going to that's what's going to show them why they need to pay us. Yeah. And that's something you're saying we can also give to them as like, hey, like take this spreadsheet and like, you know, use it. You don't have to share it with us even, but just this is what we use to calculate where to invest our time in businesses and play around with it. And if you love it, like you can share it with us if you think like whatever, however we phrase it. I think honestly, just like make it so easy. Like, listen, you have your portfolio here that's on our Google Drive. Right. That's how until we get slack or whatever notion set up. Right. Whatever it looks like, it's all the same thing is pointed to a fillable document. Well, however, that looks like. Right now, let's just say spreadsheet. In this spreadsheet, we have all the lines associated to the cost and the cost alone to run that business. So then now we have a spreadsheet that's identifying my rent, my utilities, the insurance, how much it costs for my truck, what is my liability cost, what is the insurance on my building, how many employees I got, what are they, how much do they make per year. Yep, software costs. Just the stupid questions that almost every business, they should know, but do they know is the question and we don't want to make them look like idiots, but let's just take that out of the equation and say, this is a part of your portfolio. And for us to do our jobs, we need at least this. We're not asking for personal financial information. We just need the information of the business. We don't need to know how much money you got. I don't need to know get access to your bank accounts. I just need you to answer these simple, basic operational costs for us to gauge what your daily office And if we keep referring, like once I keep referring to my daily operating costs with other people just outside of this construction alone, once I started using that term, it made me stand out to other contractors because if you break down, because sometimes jobs go into the days, not weeks. So that's when I started switching my costs.

2:53:07 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
So cost to do this job is going to cost me $16,300, whatever, right? Real fast. And then it gives me the ability to make decisions on the fly. So if our business or our clients don't have that ability, that clarity, then what other decision making processes are inhibited because they don't have clarity, right? And at the end of the day, our job is to provide that clarity.

2:53:40 - Chris Andrade
Yeah. So if we make them, force them to fill out our required operational, standard operational cost , right? Now we have a reference to point to that ROI calculator that we need so much. much. Yeah, I think like, that can be also part of the discovery is like, hey, like, it can just be a quick question in the discovery, like, Oh, what's your like, what's your daily operating costs, right? If they don't know it, we take them on that path. And if they do know it, we ask for their, their documents as part of our input to our process. And we're like, Oh, cool, we can move faster with you because this is already done. You've already done this work, right? Most of our clients aren't like this. Most of our clients, we, the first step is we got got to walk them through this to explain to them, like, this is how we do our job. But you're actually very advanced because great job. You've done this. Like once we see, they have the level of detail. So it's a, and you're on it right there, buddy. And so the breakout and that'll happen in, it broke out so beautifully. So a, it allows us to gain what kind of client we're talking to be. And then I don't even say either give us a yes or a no. Yes, that's an awesome client. Then in our sales script, we should be able to go this way with our conversation or this way. No other immune. Right? Because now we know, okay, well, he's this kind of client. So he needs this conversation. Right? Oh, no. So he knows it's done. Okay, he needs this kind of conversation. And if we start the conversation with that kind of like, we'll wait if they get to that question first. Right?

2:55:31 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
And then now we have an idea of which conversation to kind of have with the client will put us as a better opportunity to close because now we're able to identify our client even further with our first iteration of a conversation.
ACTION ITEM: Draft sales call script incl. 'daily operating cost' qualifier - WATCH: https://fathom.video/share/xVRTiBEcFnNybDKikgKZL4tbmacC84Gx?timestamp=10535.9999 Right? Now we can go okay. Because I was thinking about it this morning on my walk is like, I want to create a script for me to follow every single time. Right? That I am trying to pitch the horizon. Because then I can take that script and then I can listen to my recording. And then if I deviated from the script, then I could understand what happened. Why did I do that? Why did the call turn good? Why did the call turn bad? Like break it down, right?

2:56:16 - Chris Andrade
But if I don't have that guideline, then I don't have that ability to do it.

2:56:20 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
So that's why I want this. Oh, by the way. So pause on what we're talking about with the ROI calculator. Let's end that topic and let's put that in a book.

2:56:34 - Chris Andrade
One more thing before we do that is, so there's two things that I think, I'm not sure if you've watched the operations.

2:56:44 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
So I posted two links just now in the Google Meet chat.

2:56:47 - Chris Andrade
The first one is to Liam walking through part of the operations, the onboarding operations, where part of it is we're collecting the baseline metrics. So that's a five-minute video. Super important, I think, for your conversations this week when you're meeting with each stakeholder. Let's try and get as many of the baseline metrics as we can from those conversations.

2:57:15 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Two links here.

2:57:17 - Chris Andrade
The first one that's going to be foundational to the ROI calculator, I think, is getting some sort of metrics on this stuff, like what we're going to improve. need a baseline, right? Yeah. So, see. Yeah, so I will... That didn't go to the right link, by the way. I know. I had to log in. Let me pull up this. Where did that go? Hmm. Boop. Okay. You Yep, one, data collecting, got it. Okay, and then you have this one. Yep, yep. Yeah, this is the one we talked about with the guy. It's more detailed copy. No, this is the, oh yeah, premium. Okay, this is it. This is the one that we've been needing to make sure it referenced. Yeah, so 100%. And, but going back to the original point of this discussion is why we need to build this ROI calculator is so important because that's how we're going to close these deals a lot faster at the end of the day. So we can structure our onboarding process to also gather the information needed for the calculator. And I think by identifying. 100%. And from the very beginning of what kind of customer are you? And giving them by a simple question of, hey, quick question. Do you know what your daily operating cost is, Mr. Customer? Well, yes, Chris, I appreciate you asking that. My cost is about $832 a day. I'm like, yeah, okay. Or no, I honestly have no clue. If I was to guess, like, $300, right? And so then for us, then we know which direction to go to, and then they can initiate plan A, plan B, plan C, and ultimately give us that playbook to follow for that kind of client.

2:59:43 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
And then later, when we have our reps coming in, when we can hire people to make those phone calls, they already know how these conversations work because we already had them recorded. We already have the scripts.

2:59:56 - Chris Andrade
They're just getting the better iteration version.

3:00:00 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
And so, but yeah, very important. So going back to our plan here, it's like, it looks like rate limit options.

3:00:14 - Chris Andrade
You've hit your limit, reset 1pm, American Phoenix, stop and wait for limit to reset, switch to extra usage. Oh, so it's saying I used my limit for credits for today. So it says till 1pm. I'm curious about, so option one is stop and wait till 1pm basically.

3:00:43 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Upgrade your plan is one option. How much are paying per month for the Claude?

3:00:48 - Chris Andrade 20. Oh, that's nothing. So that might be an option to upgrade to the 100.

3:00:52 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
But what is option number two? What is that? to extra usage. That might just be another. So your plan thing, but can you click that?

3:01:03 - Chris Andrade
What?

3:01:04 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Let's try selecting that. I think so. Yeah, let's try it. See what happens. I did number two.

3:01:13 - Chris Andrade
What is this?

3:01:18 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
We'll turn on extra usage by using Claude. Instead of being blocked based on pricing standard API rates, interruption, enabling extra usage to enable usage. So is that saying they're going to charge per sort of? It looks like it said per API. So they're going to charge you.

3:01:53 - Chris Andrade
So you pay 20 bucks a month, but if you enable extra usage as you use it, they'll charge you like five bucks. Yes. It looks like you could actually put a cap. Yeah. Might be an option. So it looks like extra usage pricing.

3:02:16 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
You could try it out, but I kind of think that it's going to be more cost effective to use to start with the $100 a month plan now. Like right now, instead of doing the pay per usage, or if you want, you could wait until 1pm and then start again.

3:02:37 - Chris Andrade
But like, I think the ROI on this is pretty good. Like I've, I've got, you know, my financial situation. I've got, I've got the max plan because I just can't be blocked by waiting. Like when I need to work, I need to work. So, um, my question is, is like, Hey, uh, I'm wondering if I I'm wondering if we're using so much because we're initializing it and setting it up because the session's been so long, but not every session is going to be so active.

3:03:13 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
think so. And also we're using Opus, which uses things faster. Yeah, so it actually breaks it down right here.

3:03:23 - Chris Andrade
Yeah, maybe for you, because you're not coding stuff. Like maybe the 20 a month would be fine. Yeah, because if I'm just using it just to reference my ideas and transcript, you know what mean? I would be curious. I mean, if it comes to it, then yeah. If I would like to let me wait till one and let me wait till this refreshes and then we'll go from there. would be nice to take a little break anyways. Okay, perfect. Sounds good. Awesome. Well, then we will go ahead and end that note.
ACTION ITEM: Process Fathom recording; extract ROI calculator & growth strategies; share w/ Mekaiel - WATCH: https://fathom.video/share/xVRTiBEcFnNybDKikgKZL4tbmacC84Gx?timestamp=11037.9999 And then, yeah, we'll hop back on, I'll hop back on here at one and see where you're at. Okay. So just to do a quick little recap, what should we do with the Fathom notes here? Like, so we're going to, we have the recording. We're going to get a picture of how much that was discussed and the quality of what we were discussed.

We have multiple, honestly, we have multiple things that we discussed, right? Obviously, we want the video for the training for this. Then we have the discussions about the ROI calculator, which are hugely important. And then the growth strategies that we referenced, right, about what our ideas are. I don't know if there's a way that we can just put that through the transcript and then pull out those components. And then reference them, just reference the two, the growth strategy and the ROI calculator topics, and then the guys on those alone, and then just use the reference, the rest as just, because now we can just take the video and cut that and trim that however we need. Yeah.

So, like, the Fathom, in my Fathom now, I'll have this recorded. I think you have your Fireflies, maybe? Oh, . I did not turn that on. Okay. So, well, I should have it. I'm pretty sure my Fathom worked this time. I'm gonna be so heartbroken if it's not. Oh, I know. This happened yesterday, and we almost lost something that me and Mekaiel worked on, but we got it. We got it back. Okay. Okay. I forgot the redundant.

got Okay. You don't know, got We'll let it end this because it's been quite a while and then, um, yeah, I was thinking like, so I'm, I'm going to process the meeting summary and transcript.

It would be cool if you can do that too. Like, I know that your anthropic limit is hit, but you can, you can take it over to chat GPT. So once I send the link, you can do something with it if you want, we don't have, no, I, I, I like that. Send me the link and then I'll run it through my, cause I still have Gemini. Yeah. And then I'll run it through Gemini and, and, and, um, and then I would, I can pull off some of my points, I think from yours too, from the ROI and our growth strategy. And then let's reference that to the team and then let's put that in our Slack channels and, and say, Hey, me and Chris spent the past three hours strategizing and building. This is kind of what we came up with. One of your guys' thoughts. Yeah. Sounds good. All right, bro. All right, bro. See you later. All right, see you in a bit. Bye.
