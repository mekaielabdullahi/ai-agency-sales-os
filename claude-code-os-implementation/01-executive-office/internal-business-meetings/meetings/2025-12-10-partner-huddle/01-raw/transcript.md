# 2025-12-10 Partner Huddle - Transcript

@Trent [10:03]: Yeah

@Chris Andrade [10:03]: Yeah Coming up, I'm gonna go get some coffee real quick if that's cool.

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [10:09]: And our

@Trent [10:09]: No, it's not. What would you do if we said no.

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [10:15]: Can still probably go get it.

@Trent [10:16]: Yeah, he's still go get the coffee.

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [10:20]: There he is What up, Matthew

@Matthew Kerns [10:26]: Hey guys, good morning. Hey.

@Trent [10:28]: Hey Good morning. You get the crusties knocked out of your eyes?

@Matthew Kerns [10:34]: Yeah.

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [10:37]: The West I suppose

@Trent [10:37]: You know it's only for you, but you've been getting up early, so.

@Matthew Kerns [10:41]: Yeah, it's not too bad anymore.

@Trent [10:48]: I was trying to have Clawed Like recreate some of those visuals that are in the The Word document or the the doc that we got from And we're still waiting on Chris. He's getting some coffee, but I was just

@Trent [11:08]: Making small, small talk, but But how's Matthew this morning? We were talking about ourselves, so

@Matthew Kerns [11:15]: I'm doing good Yeah, I did the, I didn't work too much on this stuff after we got off, but I did

@Trent [11:17]: Yeah

@Matthew Kerns [11:26]: Do the, the update with the general summary document, to the audit stuff that I had.

@Trent [11:33]: Yeah

@Matthew Kerns [11:33]: In the development of and then I just updated the dashboard, I was just taking a look over it now. But

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [11:49]: Where did I put the links? What channel did I put that in yesterday?

@Matthew Kerns [11:49]: Yeah

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [11:54]: Client onboarding Or no

@Chris Andrade [11:59]: Yeah, sorry about that, fellas.

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [12:03]: No worries

@Trent [12:03]: Oh good, all good.

@Matthew Kerns [12:04]: Students

@Chris Andrade [12:05]: So that 3-step framework to start off with that real quick, dude. Like this is gonna have to be an iteration, and I'm gonna really have to memorize like every single step. But

@Trent [12:18]: Yeah.

@Chris Andrade [12:19]: It's nice to have a playbook to like go off, but I'm more or less would like to learn and download like just more or less the verbiage and the methodology, right? It's really

@Matthew Kerns [12:28]: Yeah, yup.

@Chris Andrade [12:31]: Just hone in on that aspect because, I mean, this is a step by step playbook, like straight up.

@Trent [12:37]: Yeah, pretty much. It has like, it fills in the gaps for us. I think we had some gaps when we were discussing, you know, what do we do, what does it look like? What are the steps look like? What are the deliverables, meaning like what are we going to present to the client for trying to convince them that this is worth, worth doing, and it pretty much spells that out. Now, I don't know if you guys got a chance to see my messages, but, the free downloadable off YouTube is not the same as one that they recently put in the

@Chris Andrade [12:43]: Right

@Trent [13:07]: Community, Eric Bledsoe told me it's not in the community, but then I went to look to see if maybe some of the materials like the The PowerPoint slides or like the diagrams or anything was in the resources area in the community, and I found the same one that we already had, but it, it says premium on the, on the, here, I'll just share my screen so we can look at it together.

@Trent [13:37]: So it It says premium on the file name Where was that? Gosh darn it. Do do do do do do do. Well,

@Matthew Kerns [13:56]: He's the link to the message that you sent.

@Trent [14:00]: Yeah Yeah, so here in the community, OK, under the resources, like you go on the left-hand side, there's resources, you got resources, and then you can find it, the three-step AI audit framework, and this says this is a premium exclusive version for the, you know, from the free YouTube resource. So there are inside of here

@Trent [14:21]: There are some things that are like this is all the same. This is all the same This though, the ones that say TripleA exclusive insight, it gives some more content or detail about

@Chris Andrade [14:34]: OK. Yeah, that's the one I was going reading through last night then.

@Trent [14:36]: OK Yes, the ones that have this, like there's a couple sections that have this exclusive stuff, that's

@Chris Andrade [14:42]: Right And the ROI calculator.

@Trent [14:48]: Yep, yep, and down here, yeah, and I was going to go ahead and put this in Claude and say, hey, can you recreate this for us so that we

@Chris Andrade [14:48]: Right there, yep I, I was confused by what was like, what was that trying to, or what is that going through? It was kind of hard

@Trent [15:00]: OK, so Let's, let's just kinda just take just a brief look. We're just gonna do a like a, I don't know, 10,000 ft view, not 30,000, kind of already did the 3000 and it maybe came down a little bit, but let's look like a 10,000 ft view here. So if I'm scrolling down through here, you know, this is the framework. We don't, I'm not looking at that right now. it breaks down the framework and it gives us

@Chris Andrade [15:10]: Yeah

@Trent [15:24]: So it's given us templates for the stakeholder interview. And if you look at what Mikel created, like he merged what we already had before with this, and it, it broke it down for us, even more specifically for what we're trying to do.

@Chris Andrade [15:35]: Yep Yep

@Trent [15:42]: So anyway, stakeholder interview, so it gives us a template on the questions to ask, the, the areas to cover when we have the interview with them, the end user interview, so this would be people that are using, you know, applying the day to day Right? So, so it gives us those templates of the questions to ask.

@Chris Andrade [16:00]: Mhm.

@Trent [16:00]: Then here looking at the readiness survey, what this was, was basically a way to broadly ask and survey a larger body of people that you

@Chris Andrade [16:11]: Oh I like the workers, right?

@Trent [16:14]: Yeah, like maybe, you know, instead of having an individual interview with individual people, you could send this out in masse to mimic.

@Chris Andrade [16:18]: Mhm. Oh yeah, yeah

@Trent [16:24]: To many people to just get a little bit of the lay of the land. And I, and I love how the very bottom, where the survey actually says that it was that the the

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [16:26]: Like one session, right?

@Chris Andrade [16:36]: Culture in the environment was already Like geared to adopt the recommendations.

@Trent [16:42]: Yeah. Exactly Yeah, like right here it says most employees, some things that we learn. Most employees have low confidence, but they were highly curious, right? And they also found out that several teams were already experimenting with AI outside of their official workflows. They also leadership realized that adoption won't be a push, because that's one thing that they worry about is change management, right? And now, when they understand what everybody's perception is or where they stand on AI

@Chris Andrade [16:47]: Oh yeah Right Yeah

@Trent [17:15]: Now it's a little bit easier to be able to push new tools, right?

@Chris Andrade [17:17]: And that's that's what I loved about this part about it is like it this gave the voice to all the people that got hurt it and then realized that management's like damn, we're already in the motions of adopted, we just didn't know it.

@Trent [17:34]: Yeah, like under their, you know, under the radar, people are curious about it and exploring it, and they didn't even realize it, and they were thinking that they only do what we tell them, right? That's not reality. but anyway, so this year is a readiness survey that you can send out to like your entire body of the business and see what they say or you can do it, you know, certain departments or whatever, you can divide it up however you see fit, but it's a, it's a way in bulk to measure the sentiment and where you're at with your AI

@Chris Andrade [17:38]: But Right, right

@Trent [18:04]: Readiness and a larger body, but you're just not going to get as much detail, right? So this is where you map the process to find the opportunities. So what we haven't done using plotter mechanics as a as an example here because I think this is the the biggest thing right in front of us right now to use as an example

@Trent [18:27]: We haven't mapped out any processes. Now, we also have limited knowledge into their process. So, I think it would be a good experiment And actually a good Thing to present to plotter mechanics, to Kelsey, that if we can just take what we have now and just see what we can put on a process diagram, OK? and just in case we needed it,

@Trent [18:57]: In case we needed it, I have process mapping If we need to use this or want to use this, or we want to use stigma, it's fine, or we wanna use whatever, but I just dumped in an image into cloud code and said, hey, can you recreate this for me?

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [19:12]: Evaluate before we pull it out.

@Chris Andrade [19:14]: And they gave you that Damn, God, I really got, yeah, that's so cool.

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [19:17]: But your schedule for The more

@Trent [19:21]: Yeah, so they created this diagram formally.

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [19:22]: I Because my last name. Sorry about that, yeah. I, I knew that too. I apologize.

@Chris Andrade [19:24]: OK.

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [19:28]: No, no problem. I just asked this

@Chris Andrade [19:30]: Interesting

@Trent [19:31]: Yeah, so anyway, it gave me this, and if I were to see if I can zoom out a little bit better.

@Chris Andrade [19:36]: Yeah, so I, I was reading through this last night, and I'm like, well, I mean, at least we started off on the right foot, right? Then't know what we were doing with plotter mechanics, like legit, we were following it, to a T until like

@Trent [19:44]: Yeah. You, you You did this

@Chris Andrade [19:54]: Right.

@Trent [19:55]: You did, you may not have followed this framework, but you did it, right? You did it at his place. You just went and you just did what you know how to do, but you did the stakeholder interview.

@Chris Andrade [19:57]: Right Yeah Yeah.

@Trent [20:06]: But this deal is a template that we can use going forward to continue, like improving what we're we're doing.

@Chris Andrade [20:10]: That's just it was just cool to me. It was like, oh, well, at least we were already on the right path, you know, and I think it would be wise, once we have our assessment with him next week and be like

@Trent [20:16]: Yup. Yup, yup

@Chris Andrade [20:29]: Kind of see you fill him out, you know, and see where he wants to go with it and like, I would like to redo this because ultimately, I only got to hear him. I didn't get to hear his wife. Who is a major stakeholder

@Trent [20:39]: Yeah Yup

@Chris Andrade [20:41]: I didn't really get to have a chance to interview Ashley. Who is the main the another part, you know, so there were some gaps that we would need to get done, but it just ultimately shows us that, so.

@Trent [20:46]: Yeah. Yeah

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [20:55]: There's a

@Trent [20:57]: So I think that what we should do is that like, I'm just starting with this right now, but I think what we should do is try to map out whatever we can, and then what it's going to do is we're going to have some boxes or we're going to have a big question mark here and a big question mark there, but it helps us identify the things we know, the things we don't know, so that we can say, hey, look, here's the reasons, here's where we're at, and here's the reasons that we need to ask you some more questions, right, to try to fill in some of these gaps and try to get some more detail.

@Chris Andrade [21:15]: In

@Matthew Kerns [21:23]: Yeah

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [21:25]: Yes There's a, there's a business mapping, there's a business function mapping agent that I worked on, Matthew are gonna take the information that we have available from the other mechanics and try to run it through that, and then maybe send that information that it spits out into dry IO to kinda maybe map something out like this.

@Trent [21:32]: Yep Yep Yup Yup Yeah Yeah, we'll see if we can get it to do.

@Chris Andrade [21:48]: One quick question, so as I was rolling through this last night, I wrote a couple of questions for the time scenes and the quality risk, right? On the, yeah, how it

@Trent [21:58]: Get in here. Yeah.

@Chris Andrade [21:58]: How were those, are those determined by us, by them, or the agent? Like, where does that

@Matthew Kerns [22:08]: Well, I think it has to come from the actual company, processes, and they, they've already indicated some of the things,

@Chris Andrade [22:16]: Going through the questions on like repetitive, which one's repetitive, which one, you know,

@Matthew Kerns [22:17]: So we just, just in Yeah, like I think there was.

@Chris Andrade [22:27]: It was really hard to read the diagram too, you know, like you can't really eat.

@Trent [22:30]: Yeah, I was Yeah, that's why I went to look in the resources to see if I could find it, so that I could see the detail, but

@Chris Andrade [22:35]: Right Yeah, so, but that's, I mean, those key markers, like that's, that's our bread and butter, right? Those, the more those are in there, the more opportunities for us.

@Trent [22:48]: So the bubbles, so the bubbles that are pointing to the like This down here

@Chris Andrade [22:55]: Uh-huh

@Trent [22:57]: You just let me draw? Yeah, well, so these bubbles down here like this.

@Chris Andrade [23:02]: Right

@Trent [23:03]: That one's a red one, so that's a critical process, and then the

@Chris Andrade [23:07]: Oh, I see

@Trent [23:09]: Let's see, what else, like there's white ones here. But to these white ones, it looks like there might be color next to the Like overheating

@Chris Andrade [23:20]: Yeah, like that little mhm.

@Trent [23:21]: Right there, there's like color to the left of the text in there. So I don't know if that's the markers. Or if it's this,

@Chris Andrade [23:31]: Right. Was, and was this all off of that metal? Fabricator or that steel fabricator that OK.

@Trent [23:38]: Yeah. I think so, yeah, I think so. So it says company XX, so they took the company off the thing.

@Chris Andrade [23:40]: OK. Right Right.

@Trent [23:46]: But so anyway, I think that I think that It's whoever can decipher it. so, so down coming down here, it says

@Chris Andrade [23:54]: Right.

@Trent [23:59]: The most important part is to identify the friction, so things that are slowing things down, use a simple legend to tag things. So time sinks are highly manual, repetitive, and consume lots of employee time. I think that We won't know that for sure. We can make assumptions.

@Chris Andrade [24:17]: Right

@Trent [24:17]: But we have to listen to the process.

@Chris Andrade [24:19]: Exactly

@Trent [24:20]: And then once we listen to the process, either the, the client can say, oh my gosh, it takes Fred a really long time to do all these tasks, right? That's an indication that it's a time sank. but for us, we can just observe and say, look, it takes you 5 hours a week to do this one task. We can trim it down to, you know, 3 or 2 or 1 or whatever it is to quantify it, right?

@Chris Andrade [24:28]: Right Right Right And then, and then that's where the opportunity matrix come into play, right?

@Trent [24:48]: Yep, yep. And then there's quality risks thing, you know, what we were talking about for The sheds, right? So the, the quality goes down based on a process, we can identify whether or not the the quality of work, the quality of the product, whatever that is, because work work or service calls are still the product, right? So.

@Chris Andrade [24:59]: Right. And I think they associated this problem with the CRM, which was their in their opportunity matrix for a quick friend to just record because the guys were

@Chris Andrade [25:20]: I think having to dictate all of the notes about each customer, and they would do it. In one clump of time. And they have 55 customers to update the CRM on, so the quality of the data wasn't good, and then

@Chris Andrade [25:39]: They used that this AI recorder animated CRM update. On their quick wins And that was

@Trent [25:46]: Yeah

@Chris Andrade [25:48]: Like the ROI that they were able to prove on that.

@Trent [25:52]: Yeah.

@Chris Andrade [25:52]: And how they calculated that? So cool.

@Trent [25:54]: Mhm

@Chris Andrade [25:56]: Like,

@Trent [25:56]: And

@Chris Andrade [25:57]: So cool

@Trent [25:59]: So, so continuing through the document, the journey, right, of the things that we can do with potter mechanics, so if we can just try to do whatever we can to, to, to do this, the sequence, the processes that we know of, anything. It might just be two blocks, and the big question mark in the middle, but if we can at least just have something to show him that look, this is the type of work that we're trying to, you know, do for you. We're trying to analyze your process so that we can identify the, the key points that need

@Chris Andrade [26:15]: Right

@Trent [26:29]: To inject. Anyway I think after that, it would be a good thing for us to do exactly this, like, we have ideas of what we want to give him. He has already requested some things like inventory management. We should place them on this

@Trent [26:46]: On this diagram, this opportunity matrix here. Now, right now, I don't know if we have like a way to measure, like a quantifiable like 1234, like a scoring. Right now we don't have scoring, and there's no recommendation in here, I don't think for doing scoring. So this is going to be more of like a subjective place it where you think it is.

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [27:07]: How can we create like an opportunity matrix like that. If we do like trial or

@Trent [27:10]: OK Well, I mean, you can draw it on on any number of different platforms if you just want to draw it out and then just drop the blocks like these, you know, these blocks are just like our ideas of opportunities of systems or tools or, you know, AI things that we want to build, and then what one, what Eric Bledsoe, what he was highlighting to me was that this bottom right corner is what he targets first, because these are the, these are the high business

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [27:17]: Schedule to learn about

@Trent [27:42]: Impact, low effort to implement. Right? So, he said these are the ones you wanna do because you want to do these higher

@Chris Andrade [27:46]: Yeah

@Trent [27:51]: You know, these effort to implement

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [27:55]: And that's where the time comes in, where they need more time.

@Trent [27:55]: Big things, right? Yeah. Yeah, the quick wins is what you want to do first, but it takes longer to do big swings, and you might have potentially higher impact in the big swings, but you need time and money to do that, so you can owns the feed in.

@Chris Andrade [28:05]: Right Proof of concepts

@Trent [28:11]: Well, yeah, maybe proof of concepts or maybe they're just small tool sets that you put in place to get some benefit, you save time or you save money or you make more money, and then you have the money to reinvest in the bigger swings, right? That's the, that's the idea there. But I think that what we should do is we should try to take the, anything that he's requested and looked through the notes that we have, and

@Chris Andrade [28:15]: Right Hm.

@Trent [28:34]: And identify the things that we could do. So, I know Matthew has brought up, how can we save him more time because Kelsey basically, and that's what Claude Code keeps pushing out, no matter how many iterations we push in it, it pushes out the Kelsey's time is valuable because when he's not doing anything, the business stands still. Like no one can do anything without him. So

@Chris Andrade [28:57]: And, and I think the easiest way to make him Palette that is again by throwing those dollar matrix. To it, right in, and the return on investment calculator is are I I forgot how he labeled it, but that's like, that's our, you keep scrolling down, like

@Trent [29:09]: Yep.

@Chris Andrade [29:22]: What is it?

@Trent [29:23]: And and just so you just so you guys know, I already had Claude Code recreate the Matrix. So we can Create it here OK? So, I just gave it an image and said, hey, can you recreate this in a template form and draw IO and it, it did for me, so.

@Chris Andrade [29:41]: Oh

@Trent [29:42]: Yeah. Now there are other tools that are fancier, like I've worked with like Miro and Figma and all these other tools and yeah, they kind of have their own little AI spin that they put in them, but being able to take what we have, like what we're doing right now, and put it in Cloud code and it automatically generate this stuff for us is a huge unlock, and I really don't think that, you know, if we can't do that,

@Chris Andrade [29:42]: Boom

@Matthew Kerns [30:01]: Yeah

@Trent [30:07]: I don't know why we should look at other like a tool that can't do that, right? And unless it has the same capability built into it somehow.

@Chris Andrade [30:10]: Right, right

@Trent [30:15]: So anyway, anyway, it's right here. We can, we can use this to build out our, our opportunity matrix for Kelsey, OK.

@Chris Andrade [30:25]: That's awesome

@Trent [30:25]: And I can share this as a file. It's it's just a file in my directory here, it's just a draw to IO file.

@Chris Andrade [30:32]: Oh, OK

@Trent [30:34]: So I can put it in GitHub, I can send it to you guys in this chat if you want. I mean, I can send it however you want. and you don't have to open it up in Visual Studio code. There's a, you can open it up online, you can open it up in the desktop app, and it's all free.

@Chris Andrade [30:48]: Who

@Trent [30:49]: Yeah, so anyway, that's what I love. Yeah, that's what I love about it. So anyway, enough about that. Moving forward into the next thing that you were talking about. Here's the details about the Matrix when we actually do it, we need to understand what we're doing. So that's that. And then validate your solutions. So

@Chris Andrade [30:50]: Cool. That's awesome dude. Yeah. Mhm

@Trent [31:08]: It, it hits on a good point here is that we're going to have ideas That we're gonna put on that chart. We're also gonna hear him and he's going to have ideas that we're going to put on the opportunity matrix. But what we really need to do is show him, and we need to come from a perspective of, listen, we're experts at implementing the technology, but we're not experts at your business. So does this look right to you? Does this look like this is a good opportunity to you, right? So that's what this section is about

@Chris Andrade [31:12]: Yeah Right

@Chris Andrade [31:30]: Mhm

@Trent [31:37]: Then it talks about building out a roadmap. So once we have opportunities, can we build out a roadmap now with what the information is that we have now. Do we think we can? Now, a roadmap like looking like this.

@Chris Andrade [31:49]: I mean, I like you were talking about, man, I, that's where I think we would need to get like another

@Trent [31:57]: Passed.

@Chris Andrade [31:58]: Wave of interview

@Trent [31:59]: Yeah Me too. I, I

@Chris Andrade [32:00]: You know

@Trent [32:01]: I think that we could have a template.

@Chris Andrade [32:04]: Right

@Trent [32:04]: That we can show him, hey, look, once we know the opportunities that we want to identify and apply for you or recommend to you, we, we can give you a timeline, but right now we don't have enough information to give you a time.

@Chris Andrade [32:19]: Right Right

@Trent [32:20]: So, That's the way I feel about it

@Matthew Kerns [32:23]: We're gonna have a bunch of questions like, OK, why and where exactly is Kelsey in the process of these other business processes that once we free up his time, now it unlocks these processes to flow more streamlined,

@Trent [32:39]: Yeah Yes, precisely, I think that

@Matthew Kerns [32:42]: And then that That, that allows us to figure out what is the actual ROI and hone in that 130,000 number or whatever it was.

@Trent [32:51]: Yeah. And I, I think that, you know, using, going back to the stakeholder interview template that's at the top of the questions. I think if we go back to Kelsey and, you know, show him where we're at, because I think I need to, we, we need to create something that has a visual representation of where we are at with what we're trying to do for him.

@Chris Andrade [33:00]: Yeah. Yup

@Matthew Kerns [33:09]: Yeah.

@Trent [33:12]: And then we ask him those questions to try to fill in gaps and get more detail I think that at that point, We will have enough info that we can at least get started on the first potential opportunities to map them out on a timeline, to map them out on the the Matrix, and then

@Chris Andrade [33:26]: Yeah

@Trent [33:31]: Down here is where the money slide comes in that you were talking about. That money slide, So they're talking about 5 key slides you must include. So We'll have to

@Chris Andrade [33:44]: And that's another thing is like, it says full 10 to 5 so I, but I only see that these slides where it was.

@Trent [33:50]: It's the, yeah, it's this one here, it's scope and objectives and then a opportunity the Patriots.

@Chris Andrade [33:54]: Right. OK, OK, so that's where these flashlights came in.

@Trent [33:58]: Yeah. Opportunity matrix, the roadmap summary, so, so actually You know, some of the things that we looked at above this section, like the opportunity Matrix, for example, is right here. It's like in a different format, like the same thing in a different format. So now what they're doing is they're showing us, look, here's what your slide deck should look like.

@Chris Andrade [34:07]: Hm Mhm Right Mhm

@Trent [34:22]: Your slide deck should have this. The opportunity matrix The roadmap summary. So the roadmap summary looks like to me it's not necessarily Like

@Trent [34:38]: Laying out exactly how long everything is gonna be. Like it doesn't chart, OK?

@Chris Andrade [34:41]: Right

@Trent [34:46]: Then he's showing opportunity deep dive. So, each of your top 1 to 3 quick win recommendations, breaking them down. It's like this is an example of Automated CRM updates. So this was like one of the opportunities we identified that we are recommending that he apply. And then we break we break it down in the slide to explain to him why.

@Chris Andrade [35:06]: Yeah

@Trent [35:10]: Right The next one is actually it looks like these are

@Matthew Kerns [35:18]: Yeah. That was good.

@Trent [35:22]: There's one of your CRM update time. This one right here is, oh, he's got a little bread crumb kind of thing at the top, right?

@Chris Andrade [35:29]: Oh yeah, OK.

@Trent [35:30]: So these are actually the same. OK, so these are for the same opportunity But two slides. So they're representing it in two slides. And then here is the money slide. So this one right here is the ROI summary. I, once we identify opportunities,

@Trent [35:48]: Once we have a better idea how long things take him, then we can give him an estimated ROI on things. Right? But that comes back to us You know, asking him more questions.

@Chris Andrade [36:00]: You get to get these types of in order to really, I mean, like that right there that they put the formula and for that out so relieved to see that.

@Trent [36:08]: Yes. Yeah, so this slide, this slide because it might be coming back to the question you asked Chris. the, the Excel spreadsheet that we were looking at in the beginning of what we started here.

@Trent [36:26]: It's the calculations and the numbers that makes up this sheet. This sheet, this slide that we're showing right now is the summary effectively. It's the Way that we want to rep represent it to him, but what they're trying to highlight in this document is that it's important to have some meat behind the numbers. Here down here's the meat.

@Chris Andrade [36:45]: Yeah

@Trent [36:48]: This is

@Chris Andrade [36:48]: OK

@Trent [36:50]: This is the detail of, this is where we actually start. Like when we're creating our calculations, when we create this slide, Here,

@Chris Andrade [36:59]: Mhm

@Trent [37:00]: The back end of that, like our creation of these numbers is going to be calculated based on this. So it's gonna be the summary

@Chris Andrade [37:10]: I was having a hard time reading those line items.

@Trent [37:13]: Yeah, they are kind of hard to read. I was trying to zoom in further too and, and.

@Chris Andrade [37:15]: You know Yeah, so like, it seems like I don't know why, but yeah, a number of inquiries per month percentage of required

@Trent [37:24]: Total hours spent on basic is 75.

@Chris Andrade [37:27]: OK Interesting

@Trent [37:30]: The ROI is, or it says total cost saved per year is 36,000. The ROI Is 144%.

@Chris Andrade [37:42]: Hm

@Trent [37:43]: So the ROI, the way they come up with the ROI is it's, it costs him $36,000 per year to do nothing. Well, wait a minute That's what, sorry, that's what it costs him now, or that's what he's going to save. Sorry. He's going to save 36,000 in a year, and it costs 25,000 to implement.

@Chris Andrade [38:03]: I, yeah

@Trent [38:04]: Yeah.

@Chris Andrade [38:05]: And that's, that's my friends, like, that is the hardest part in it and it literally will sell its steal.

@Trent [38:11]: Yup Yeah.

@Chris Andrade [38:16]: If we can convey it the right way, right?

@Trent [38:20]: Yep, yup.

@Chris Andrade [38:21]: And so I think we got Enough of a runway for an a good Next follow up with Kelsey and his wife, which I'm gonna initiate, you know, sometime next week. To sit down with them to go over the results from what we found with what they paid for, and they give them a little status update, and then execute on a plan to get to this level, right? I think we can do that. I, I mean, I could probably even get it in by Monday if you guys want it, you know, for times I've happened.

@Trent [38:47]: Mhm I really Yeah, we need more time, I think. So I think that mid mid to late next week would be a good good part.

@Chris Andrade [38:58]: Yeah OK, so,

@Trent [39:02]: OK

@Chris Andrade [39:06]: Are, are, is there anything else anybody wants to kind of just throw in before I kind of let you guys know what happened last night.

@Trent [39:14]: Yeah, I've, I've kind of dominated the conversation too, so I'll shut up.

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [39:18]: No, no worries, we needed that because at the end of the day, that's our funnel, right?

@Chris Andrade [39:21]: Yeah, 100%

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [39:22]: I feel like the sooner we figure that piece out, we're almost there. I feel like if we push a sprint to get that done and really push out that matrix using plotter mechanics, information we have in order we can collect. I think we should be in good, in a good place.

@Trent [39:38]: Yeah.

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [39:38]: Do you think me realistically, McAveli, that would be like

@Chris Andrade [39:44]: Doable.

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [39:46]: I would, to be honest, me personally, from my end, I know I finished the business processing, agent. I wanna like take the information that Matthew was working on, and he already kind of started, but just put that through the business processing map. I tried to get Dra IO in my photos. I don't think I was successful last night, but then get it to pop out like an image like it did for the opportunity Matrix because I was going to ask you guys yesterday when we were talking about the audit stuff. I do remember pulling the three step framework,

@Trent [40:16]: Yeah

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [40:16]: The framework from the AAA and putting it into my OS and then I put it in there yesterday, and it, and I put like, I posted like the gap analysis. It wasn't too much missing. There's a few pieces to tie it together, but that's done now, and I wanna kind of update the business processing agent and then have that agent like, take me through, like, ask questions about latter mechanic, feed that information over and then see if we can get that mapped out on like, like the map that you showed me, and then maybe even the opportunity

@Trent [40:44]: Yeah.

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [40:46]: Matrix as well. And then like, we we could pass it off to Trent, we can all look over it. And then come up with like a presentation to give them next week.

@Trent [40:54]: Yeah Yeah, I think that, you know, let's get all the, like, let's get all the

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [40:59]: Technical stuff together

@Trent [40:59]: The the materials, the information, the technical pieces put together and then we can make it pretty, right? So I think that's kind of where we're headed with this is that.

@Chris Andrade [41:07]: And we, we have everything in order to do that. We don't need anything else.

@Trent [41:13]: Well, I think we have a lot of question marks to be able to execute on plotter mechanics, but I think for us to at least get started on this workflow like this three-step framework. I think that the assets that it's I think we at least have to make some effort, even though we know that it will be incomplete.

@Chris Andrade [41:32]: Right

@Trent [41:32]: To, to show to Kelsey that look,

@Chris Andrade [41:34]: I agree

@Trent [41:35]: You haven't paid us a dime, right? We haven't even committed anything right now, and we are, we are committed to trying to help you by going through our process.

@Chris Andrade [41:37]: Right. Yeah. Right

@Trent [41:45]: Yeah.

@Chris Andrade [41:46]: Yeah, and.

@Matthew Kerns [41:47]: And each of us, each of us takes a look through, you know, this is, this document that you just went over Trent is our roadmap for until we get it done, right? And I think if each of us, I think we could decide how to split up the work, but I think

@Matthew Kerns [42:04]: Like, I think I I know I need to go through this document and just understand it. and probably the, the video The YouTube video as well, but I think, yeah, we go through this and each of us Needs to break it down and really think about it for plotter mechanics, process it, and then come up with like, I think one way we could do it is all three of us do do this process separately, and we come up with our own questions where it's like, OK, we've mapped out, each of us has mapped out the process,

@Matthew Kerns [42:43]: Then we are like, OK, well, to get, like, what are the unknowns related to these numbers that are, that are gonna help us build the presentation. So like what, what questions do we need to attack this with like our current information set, what questions do we need to ask that

@Matthew Kerns [43:04]: Will help us refine these numbers, so that, you know, we have, we increase our confidence in the numbers, and, and we're gonna identify context gaps where it's like, OK, this, we need to know from the business like we need to ask whoever knows best that the company and hopefully we can identify who that is based on what we know now. Like, I don't know, his wife had maybe knows certain but.

@Trent [43:26]: Yup

@Chris Andrade [43:28]: I will be able to, we, we, I mean, we have to, right? Otherwise, what I mean what's the point? But yeah, we will be able to hone into exactly what we need, you know.

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [43:39]: Question what that meant, I'm sorry, are you done, Matthew?

@Matthew Kerns [43:43]: Yeah, yeah, go for it.

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [43:44]: I was gonna say that when we do talk to them on next week, is it more like, well, I know we're gonna propose all this stuff to them. is it with the goal of just getting them to sign on with this? Is, are we gonna like propose like, hey, like work with this for X amount of time. Like if you found this valuable or like like my question is should we have like an offer or a proposal ready for them if they do want to go on the train.

@Chris Andrade [44:03]: I, I, I think we should, I think we really should because I think we have kind of gone a little above and beyond in what I thought initially we were gonna hand him, because now we are actually breaking down the

@Chris Andrade [44:21]: Actual money that's being lost, and I think to give a sense of urgency, and let's see how serious he is, you know what I'm saying? And we just see

@Trent [44:31]: Yep, no check.

@Chris Andrade [44:33]: How that conversation goes. We don't, I don't know how much money this dude has. I know how much money he's losing, but if we're telling them, hey, like we are your plug to this sieve, but your money, your're being lost, and we're trying to actually quantify every single dollar.

@Chris Andrade [44:53]: Like Glen is healthy, but, but, and we're giving you a discount, my friend, cause this guy

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [44:55]: Yeah. I think we should have, I think when we do talk to him next week at the end of the spiel, it should tie into like an offer and be like, hey, we can get you where you need to be. It's gonna take X amount of time and it's gonna cost this much. And it's just like, go take, and then that way he can either take action or, you know,

@Chris Andrade [45:07]: Yep And that's why I wanted, that's why I want his wife in there because ultimately I know that she's gonna be this stake the stakeholder at the end of the day.

@Trent [45:23]: So, so let me just try to wrap my head around what we just talked about, what the goal is for the next meeting, primarily. Is the next meeting, I believe Is to show them where we are and what the questions and where the gaps are in our knowledge about their business, but to also show them that we are trying to work out

@Trent [45:49]: Where we can save them, the biggest money, right? The biggest opportunities, the biggest wins that we have a process that we're going through. That's what we're, we're going to show him that we're going through a process, but we're going to show him that it's incomplete and we need to work on it more.

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [46:05]: I think, sorry, even to interrupt, I think what we should do is just have everything we have just based off what Chris gave us and be like, this is what we're able to collect with with with no information. We'd love to like sit you down, take you down formally through this whole process, see if we can get all the right numbers, and then, so I just really like we did this on our own. We're gonna need you to come in and go help us, like, help you go through, take you through this process, and then we'll get an actual map out, and that's gonna take X amount of time, plus this much, and I feel like that would be, you know,

@Trent [46:14]: Yeah

@Chris Andrade [46:18]: Right

@Trent [46:25]: Yeah Yeah Yeah, yeah, yeah. So I, I was going the long-winded way of saying, Mikel said.

@Chris Andrade [46:38]: The car

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [46:40]: OK

@Trent [46:40]: Yeah, yeah, yeah, exactly, that's, that's what I was thinking is that this next meeting is not to get the questions answered. It is to show him that we do have a process that we are going to help them identify issues where you can save money and save time, right? And that's why he needs to invest in us, and that investment is what we need to have crafted. We need to have the, we need to have the the, the visual pieces.

@Chris Andrade [46:50]: Yep

@Trent [47:09]: That are deliverables, OK, to show him that we're working on it.

@Chris Andrade [47:13]: Right

@Trent [47:14]: And where we're at, and we need to have our offer crafted somehow, but hey, listen, we want to audit your business so we can show you the opportunities. So to do that, we need, we normally charge $10,000 and we're going to charge you $5 or we normally do 5 and we're going to charge you 3 or whatever we come up with, but I think that we should price anchor or value anchor somehow to show him, look, we are giving you a discount because we expect this to be at least $10,000 at some point for us to do this process.

@Chris Andrade [47:15]: Right Yep

@Chris Andrade [47:37]: Yep Right Right

@Trent [47:44]: But right now, because we're getting started and you're helping us. We're helping you, you're helping us We're, we need like some money. So I think I'll do that.

@Chris Andrade [47:52]: And, and, and, and, and I don't, I don't bat an eye with the value that we propositions this to, to, to ultimately facilitate that. I don't see him batting an eye, because he's not just buying a product, he's buying a partner. He's not just one, he's buying 4, you know.

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [48:11]: Alright.

@Trent [48:14]: Yeah. And

@Chris Andrade [48:16]: And I think that's how it needs to be sold.

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [48:18]: Also, also just really quickly, I just kinda wanna frame up the, the engagement for this audit. I feel like it should be just that, it should be a time engagement to get some type of audit done and then move on to implementation for a longer time period, if he wants to. But our personal engage it should just to be like, hey, let's, let's do this audit. We'll get you squared. Implementation's easy, but we need to, in order to even get to implementation, we need to do this. But yeah, that first engagement should be X amount of time for this marching will completely audit your business. I feel like that's a good deliverable, even

@Trent [48:33]: We get Yeah Yeah. But Yes

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [48:48]: For us, but

@Trent [48:49]: Yes, we need to tee up the next step.

@Matthew Kerns [48:50]: Yeah, and then implementation will also take time.

@Trent [48:53]: Sorry, Matthews

@Matthew Kerns [48:53]: Cause you can't do implementation without an audit, right? And then I think we all understand that now.

@Chris Andrade [48:55]: Right. OK. Right.

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [48:58]: You can't, like, we shouldn't

@Chris Andrade [48:58]: Right. Cause we don't want to build something for him that he doesn't need, so we need to

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [49:01]: We should never Just even as a company, right? We don't want to like go into people, like they're at stage 7 and we come in, we build Gen AI on top of a bad, like, system or processes or infrastructure, and then it breaks, and then we're held responsible for like, the they they're crappy, you know what I mean?

@Matthew Kerns [49:04]: Form.

@Chris Andrade [49:16]: Yeah, exactly.

@Trent [49:18]: Right, yeah, we're held responsible for the results. He'll have a bad perception because he got bad value out of something that we put in place even if it was good like what we did or executed on was good. He didn't get the value he expected. Therefore, it's a bad bad outcome.

@Matthew Kerns [49:20]: Yeah.

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [49:25]: Exactly Yeah, but if we were to go into that same company and say, hey, yeah, we could do that, but you come through our audit and then we find, hey, X, we don't suggest this because in order to build our systems or whatever, like, you know, it's gonna, we don't suggest it and they would have to go back and do that work, or like, you know, that way it just protects us.

@Matthew Kerns [49:35]: Patients

@Trent [49:47]: Hospital OK Are we open to just doing what he says? Like he says, hey, I don't want any of that right now. I just want you to build me an inventory management system. My feature.

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [50:02]: We can be like, we don't, we don't suggest that, but we could

@Chris Andrade [50:06]: Yeah, sure.

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [50:06]: I don't see why not. You know, at this point, but at the end of the day, it's like, we're we're, we're offering, we're the experts in our field, you're the experts in your field. We're offering you a roadmap to get there, but if you don't want that, that's, but he got ripped off by some guy. Like he got ripped off for 70 by some guy, and he got a whole bunch of just documents. So, it's like, bro, do it our way, you'll do it right.

@Trent [50:16]: And if we're

@Matthew Kerns [50:17]: Like, why not? Yeah I mean Like sudden expectation.

@Chris Andrade [50:29]: That's why I do at work. Go ahead, man, sorry, go ahead.

@Matthew Kerns [50:33]: Sorry, yeah, setting the expectation I think is important, like implementation, it's gonna take longer It's gonna take a while, to get things just right to where it's a functional system that he can actually use. So I think in in addition to setting the expectation for the audit's going to take time. We need to also set the expectation for implementation will also take time, and that's why it costs money, right? and so that's also why it's important that we refine and figure out, OK, like,

@Trent [50:47]: Yep

@Matthew Kerns [51:07]: Yes, you want an inventory management system, but, and we can start building that, but we also need to really like take a look at your entire business so that we can prioritize along the way because once we get to a certain stage with the inventory management system, maybe there's a higher ROI thing that we can work on.

@Trent [51:25]: Something else Yeah

@Matthew Kerns [51:30]: So

@Trent [51:30]: Yup

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [51:32]: Or it might not be useful in other parts of your business are broken, you know.

@Matthew Kerns [51:32]: We do really need

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [51:36]: That that

@Matthew Kerns [51:36]: Yeah

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [51:37]: So yeah, we can frame it that way And it makes sense. It's not, you know.

@Matthew Kerns [51:41]: Cause, cause like for business owner, like him, where he has, he's being bombarded and he like, it's his time that's that's the issue like Today the inventory management system is the problem, is the major problem, but next week it could be something else that he's like, holy shit, I didn't even realize like now this that's in my awareness, but we can take an objective look at everything, and we can we can really figure out the roadmap.

@Trent [51:56]: Os Yeah, because when he's

@Matthew Kerns [52:08]: From our parts

@Trent [52:10]: When he's in the middle of the business. He's kind of got a little bit of, he, he, he's got blinders on in a way, right? You, when you're in the middle of it, it's hard to see everything, so us taking an objective view of what he's doing, what, so like.

@Matthew Kerns [52:10]: Point of view.

@Chris Andrade [52:26]: Keep forgetting it. So, he's working there in the business, he ain't working on the business. Straight up.

@Trent [52:34]: Yup

@Chris Andrade [52:34]: And you can't, you can't make your business grow if you're in it. You can, the only way to make it grow and actually be profitable is by working on.

@Trent [52:40]: Yup You put, you put systems or you put people or you put systems and people in place so that you can move further away from the business so that you can work on the business, not in the business, like you said.

@Chris Andrade [52:54]: So what I was, what I wanted to say as I was going through this last night, I wrote down a couple notes

@Trent [52:59]: Mhm.

@Chris Andrade [53:00]: So in one of the things, I, I forget where it said, but Liam is ultimately redefined his process, and I think he said like they have become inefficiency detectives.

@Trent [53:12]: Yeah, yep.

@Chris Andrade [53:12]: Right? That's they they they the classify themselves as inefficiency detectives, and they are just going through the systems and finding those inefficiencies and not and, yeah, there you go. And Mikael, when you said, like, do not suggest anything. And then like reading it like, yeah, I mean it makes sense, right? The more things that we allow them to give us the better opportunities we have to like perform

@Matthew Kerns [53:35]: Yeah

@Chris Andrade [53:42]: For them, right

@Matthew Kerns [53:43]: And that's where I think he's at with his potentially with his inventory management suggestion because what I was telling the guys, I don't know if you heard everything, but, like he might just be like, OK, today my problem is inventory management, but like next week or the week after something else could blow up and that's just from having a lack of processes and, and he's in it, right? So,

@Chris Andrade [54:04]: Yep And that's, and I think if we keep, when we're in the meeting with them and we keep iterating those words, those key phrases for him. Then he, then he's gonna see the value in why, like he's hiring 4 employees.

@Chris Andrade [54:23]: For the price of not even one. Really, in reality, like if he's buying 4 people at a monthly rate of $4000 a month, like, $35,000 a month. Yeah, like, put some, like that's not even like

@Chris Andrade [54:41]: It's like $22 an hour. You know what I'm saying And so it's like, I, I, I think it'd be an easy sell. I really do. my second question was, in I think you answered it a little bit. I would like to see how like the mind mapping process works, but I'll just watch it as we do it live, but,

@Chris Andrade [55:10]: I think we can Get something ready. Yes, it, so is it 31 3125 an hour?

@Trent [55:17]: So if you, if you were to pay $5000 for one month, It's, and you divide it by 4 weeks, which isn't exactly a month, but 4 weeks divided by 5 days, so you're only working 5 days a week. And then you divide it by 8 hours per day. It's $31 per hour.

@Chris Andrade [55:25]: Right. 250 Yeah, Yeah. Yeah

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [55:34]: For employment, like

@Chris Andrade [55:34]: Yes And, and like, like, again, this is that ROI that we like we can and that like, like for 3125 an hour, you are getting 4 top noch dudes on your butt.

@Chris Andrade [55:50]: To build your outs systems.

@Matthew Kerns [55:51]: This is This is for one person. If one person was getting paid 5000.

@Chris Andrade [55:56]: No, I that's what are you, so you know that I'm just saying we are one, our company is one, right? So, but paying for wine and he's getting 4, right?

@Matthew Kerns [56:00]: Yeah Yeah, yeah

@Chris Andrade [56:07]: And, and I think iterating that to him in a way that he, again, the dollar value for 31 $25 an hour, like it's like that commercial, oh, you support our animals that only costs 2 cents a day, and you're like, oh, it's only 2 cents, and then you add it up to the end of the month, you know, or the year, you're like, oh shit, I just dropped $500.

@Trent [56:33]: If, if, if you would actually divide that by 4 people, it, it's $7.80. I mean, that's like

@Chris Andrade [56:33]: You know Like we're not even making minimum wage, you know.

@Trent [56:43]: Yeah, it's not minimum wage.

@Chris Andrade [56:46]: Value that we're bringing, but if we go to the end of the day and go to those numbers and reflect and use, like he's gonna be insulted, like he should be insulted.

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [56:49]: Honestly, yeah Honestly, he's gonna, he's gonna get more value on his offer call than he did on his last project, so we shouldn't even be mad.

@Chris Andrade [57:00]: Exactly. Exactly. And that that's all I'm trying to say. It's like, he's gonna see the value, he is.

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [57:08]: Yeah

@Chris Andrade [57:09]: So, so if we were to talk about how long it's going to take us to do this audit process. I mean, what they're saying too weak is what they plan for for 2 weeks. I with his team because he only has 4 people.

@Trent [57:25]: Yeah, we don't really have to spend. I mean, OK, so 2 weeks, I think actually, I think 2 weeks actually, if we, if we execute using this framework, using the templates that are for us, I think 2 weeks is

@Chris Andrade [57:28]: I.

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [57:38]: Doable.

@Trent [57:39]: I think it should be reasonably doable. The only reason I would say it's not doable for me is if for some reason it falls between December 24th and January 4th. So, I can't, I can't do much work in that period. So it would be more like, hey, we would kick off in January sometime.

@Chris Andrade [57:41]: Yeah. Yeah, yeah Yeah. OK. Oh, well, I'm glad you mentioned that because, me and Matt had a little conversation offline cause he was on his way to the real estate agent.

@Chris Andrade [58:04]: And I was just coaching him up a little bit. Because guys, I'm starting to realize that With my background in construction, After talking to Matthew, And really understanding what I have collected in the past 3 years. It's costed us over half a million dollars

@Chris Andrade [58:29]: To generate these takeoffs. To collect these data sets, and they're just sitting there. And we spent almost half a million dollars to generate these proposals to keep, so, are you familiar with the takeoff trip?

@Trent [58:49]: I can't say that I am. Maybe if you just describe it to me.

@Chris Andrade [58:51]: OK. So, this is what I was coaching Matthew on his a takeoff in construction is receiving a set of plants.

@Trent [58:53]: We might have a different term Yup

@Chris Andrade [59:04]: Quantifying those plans.

@Trent [59:06]: Yup

@Chris Andrade [59:07]: From the details provided to build the job, right?

@Trent [59:09]: Yup, yup, so you're providing a quote. Yeah, you're taking off of the blooper to create a quote, yep.

@Chris Andrade [59:10]: That's the TikTok Correct

@Trent [59:15]: Yep

@Chris Andrade [59:16]: Right

@Trent [59:17]: Yep.

@Chris Andrade [59:17]: I have half a million dollars worth of takeoffs just sitting in a dry right now.

@Trent [59:24]: Because they didn't result, they didn't result in a sale.

@Chris Andrade [59:24]: And Less than 5%.

@Trent [59:31]: OK, so 5% of that brought you revenue. Did it bring you enough revenue to at least pay for that 0.5 mil.

@Chris Andrade [59:38]: Oh. Yeah, we got about 1.8. But It didn't cover our overhead.

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [59:46]: That's all they are

@Trent [59:48]: Yeah

@Chris Andrade [59:49]: They didn't cover our overhead and then not only, I mean we still owe $700,000 to our capital venture guy. We haven't been able to pay a penny on that yet.

@Trent [59:57]: OK Yeah.

@Chris Andrade [1:00:01]: So, yeah, we're not making money, and then out of it and it and it it's all boils down to how expensive it takes to to to do takeoffs for companies, right? So then I started thinking about it.

@Trent [1:00:01]: Yeah.

@Chris Andrade [1:00:17]: And Matthew seems to think that it's a good idea because we have Platter mechanics We have My company that I Own, Remix Development

@Chris Andrade [1:00:34]: And then we have SS Wolfshits, right? So we have like these 3 clients that we can literally blow Like consistently have something to do within all three, right?

@Trent [1:00:47]: Yeah, and I hadn't even brought in anybody that I, I potentially have. I haven't even been reaching out to him really. I mean, I have been because I have contacts that I have a regular cadence with, but I, but because I haven't really figured out what we're doing yet. I haven't really spoken to them about stuff either.

@Chris Andrade [1:00:58]: OK Oh, OK. And may I ask on that? Like, she, what re reservations do you have to bring them to the, the funnel.

@Trent [1:01:13]: Well, I mean, we have a lot of work that could potentially be sitting here right now. So if we don't have it figured out just like you were reserved and reaching out to more people. I was like, OK, we have something right in front of us. Let's take care of the thing that's right in front of us to build our process. Once we understand what that looks like, which we're getting a much more clear in the last couple of days on what this looks like. and then I, then I know how to explain it to them, right?

@Chris Andrade [1:01:18]: I Yeah Right Right Right Mhm

@Chris Andrade [1:01:35]: I agree Well then, I will change the the so what I'm saying now is I have realized that This construction stuff is a serious potential

@Chris Andrade [1:01:52]: Opportunity for us to really niche down in an industry that is wide open. Right, along with the sheds. Right? That shed, that that company literally wide open, right? And we have a full-on user access because I own both companies. I, I, I mean, technically I don't own S&S Blue Shiels, but it's my parents' company. I do own Remus Development. It's only 15%.

@Trent [1:02:18]: Mhm

@Chris Andrade [1:02:22]: But I it, it's not profitable. So I really don't own shit. Actually, I'm native, but what that means for us is I can give you a login to our environment through our Microsoft and and and and we can do it two ways. I would like to pull all those takeoffs.

@Trent [1:02:37]: Yeah. Yeah

@Chris Andrade [1:02:44]: And then generate our own database for when whenever we decide we can run start reusing it. Because can I, can I show you something real quick?

@Trent [1:02:51]: Yeah

@Matthew Kerns [1:02:53]: So like a viscera data store that you can basically have a chatbot on top of.

@Chris Andrade [1:02:56]: Yeah.

@Trent [1:02:59]: Yeah. So, I, I'll just say this real quick, in, I've spoken to my

@Chris Andrade [1:03:00]: Oh

@Trent [1:03:07]: The So my client that I am doing contract work for. I have been pretty much all year. It's kept me afloat. He That's the contractor I'm doing work for, or sorry, that's the, the client I'm doing work for January, sorry,

@Trent [1:03:24]: Christmas to New Year's, OK? And He is a He's my previous employer

@Chris Andrade [1:03:33]: Oh, nice.

@Trent [1:03:33]: I, I worked for him, I worked for him, for 5 years. As a controls engineer, and he used to be a controls engineer. He's a tech guy, and now he was my manager and now he's VP of operations. And when I talked to him about that, like about AI and what I'm trying to do. He said, yes, that is my number one thing right now is to plan our initiatives for automation and AI for next year. He's like, we might be able to partner sometime next year. So, I would love it if we had something to show that we've done something or we

@Trent [1:04:09]: Have a process at least, and it's for that so I have a conversation with him in January. I can show him that we're working on something.

@Chris Andrade [1:04:10]: OK, OK, I see where you're going. I

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [1:04:18]: Same, I'm kind of, I'm kind of in a similar position. I have a few people that are in the back of my mind that I can reach out to, that I know will bring value, that are my supporters of people that supported me in the past, but yeah, I kind of like what Trump said. I wanted to like, be like, OK, look, this is what I did for someone else. I could do this for you, cause I'm big on like

@Trent [1:04:18]: Right? So,

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [1:04:37]: Action and like showing like, even if it's like your first part, whatever. It's better than 0, like coming to the table with nothing. so yeah, like my former employee as well, they're small contractor on the Department of State side, like very small. I was like their 3rd or 5th, no, I was their 5th employee. I worked for them for like almost 3 years, and they're a very small company. I do, I know the inside and outside of that, business. I traveled around the world for them for like 2.5 years, hopped around. They have a lot of like internal stuff. They use QuickBooks. I like, there's a lot of solution

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [1:05:07]: S I can talk to him about and I know that they would support me and like give me an opportunity, because I was an employee for them and I left and I talked to them. They seem at LinkedIn, so they kind of know what I'm doing. But, and then also there's my mentor. He's a retired lieutenant colonel in the Marine Corps, really big guy. I can't wait for you guys to meet him. he's, he's like my number one supporter. I, I already kind of talked to him when I was working on my own and stuff, but yeah, I wanted to like close out a few projects and then I know he has a

@Trent [1:05:09]: Yeah Yep

@Chris Andrade [1:05:26]: So.

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [1:05:37]: Wide network, and like I know he'd be done to help us out.

@Chris Andrade [1:05:39]: Oh my gosh. So this touches on the things that you said there, right, Miguel, is that you, you have inside knowledge, and this is what brought me to bring this up was because Chris was talking about his inside ability to see inside and experience inside the business, right? And that's OK Mhm Mhm

@Chris Andrade [1:05:59]: Mhm.

@Trent [1:06:02]: What Mikel's talking about. He has some insight into the businesses he had potentially he could have potential opportunities. I used to work for this company for 5 years, and I have a good relationship with the VP of operations. That's a $35 million machine builder in industrial automation, and they have tons of things that I have seen that are terribly inefficient, and I already have inside knowledge on how they work, right? The processes

@Chris Andrade [1:06:22]: Yeah. Oh my God.

@Trent [1:06:32]: And, and I've already, you know, been brainstorming on how I can solve problems for not just for them, because this would open up a different domain like we're talking about construction with Chris. I'm not sure exactly what your, Mikel is your domain is, but industrial automation and machine building, it's a lot of engineering. It's a lot of like technicians building things. It's a lot of like programmers that have to do stuff, which that's what I did. I was a controls engineer doing programming, so I kind

@Chris Andrade [1:06:44]: Yeah Electric pulse

@Trent [1:07:02]: Of, I mean, I know that process and inside now. So,

@Chris Andrade [1:07:05]: And so I work as e-commerce, so like there's a, I'm, I've been working on e-commerce brand for 3.5 years, and it's, it's not like I know a lot of things where things go wrong and automation, like how, how we can make things better. I think is a little bit still to be figured out, but overall, when I hear all this stuff, I'm just thinking

@Matthew Kerns [1:07:36]: Like, OK, like, especially also like what you shared about, OK, it's $5000 a month for this. Like that's not enough to pay all of us, right? So

@Trent [1:07:45]: Well, obviously. We're trying, we're trying to build our processes and we're giving them a deal in the beginning, right? That's, that's the whole, that's the whole premise of our offer, at least in the beginning.

@Matthew Kerns [1:07:47]: Yeah, yeah

@Chris Andrade [1:07:51]: Right

@Matthew Kerns [1:07:56]: Right. So then the big goal, yeah, I get that, and then I'm glad that you said that too. And then the big goal is, OK,

@Trent [1:07:59]: Yeah.

@Matthew Kerns [1:08:04]: At least our first big goal is 10 clients at $10,000 a month. So I've typed something out. I just put it in the chat, but it's 10 clients at $10,000 a month is $100,000 a month for the agency.

@Trent [1:08:16]: 1 point It's 1.2 million a year

@Matthew Kerns [1:08:19]: Yeah, so then the short-term question is, how can we deliver on one or a few client projects first and put together those case studies and testimonials that show we have delivered value because that will lead us to be like, OK, now we can go out and get our 10 clients, and then the long term question is how can we build a system that can actually deliver for 10 clients per month.

@Trent [1:08:44]: Are you, are you, you reading, are you reading the Money Model's book?

@Matthew Kerns [1:08:45]: Right. I'm about to, it's on my bed, right next to where I sleep.

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [1:08:51]: Cause, cause that's, that's like one of the big things for Hormozi is that like if you haven't done anything, if you don't have any social proof like testimonials. He said, all you really need is to just find a way to do some work to get the testimonials. So I think that that's kind of where we are, sort of.

@Chris Andrade [1:09:04]: So So just real quick, just so you know, we got, we got a testimonial from plowing mechanics. That's a very, that's the kind of our coli. I can provide a testimonial for Remus's development for just implementing just some quick, simple shit that I'll show you guys here in a second.

@Trent [1:09:15]: Yeah.

@Chris Andrade [1:09:23]: And then we got a testimonial from SNS woolsheds.

@Trent [1:09:23]: OK

@Chris Andrade [1:09:26]: And this is why I think those letters of intent, just to have a conversation with the guys that I'm thinking about, would be speak volumes because not only do we have testimonials. Now we can say, hey, do you mind if I put your brand on my website? Can I put your logo on my website?

@Trent [1:09:44]: Yeah. Well, that, I mean that almost should be like just part of our agreement that we are allowed to say

@Matthew Kerns [1:09:47]: Yeah.

@Trent [1:09:50]: Like if they give us a testimonial, well, OK, so here's the thing, I've I've toyed around with the idea, and I've heard it recommended that if you ask people to give you a, you know, a, a testimonial, then you give them a discount, right? Or there's also that like, you can write into your agreement that, hey, the, the benefits that are achieved throughout our

@Trent [1:10:14]: You know, throughout our

@Chris Andrade [1:10:14]: Engagement

@Trent [1:10:16]: Engagement, yeah, or I'm, I'm allowed to own those results so that I can present them on my website to show other people, right? And, and use your brand for that. Just s showing a logo, not, not necessarily taking their name and saying that they said this, right, quoting them, but, but saying, hey, for this company, we were able to do this for them, right? So.

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [1:10:17]: We share

@Chris Andrade [1:10:26]: Right Right Right And, and, and like, so

@Chris Andrade [1:10:42]: I, we can have those quick, easy wins and like, so the reason why I was going down this route is because of our conversation yesterday, right? And understanding that we all have a runway here, and we don't want this runway to end because we see the value that we all bring. So then I'm here trying to bringstorm some ideas on how I can get some quick revenue into the coffers here, right, to support you guys cause like I said, I

@Trent [1:11:03]: Yep

@Chris Andrade [1:11:12]: Don't plan on taking any money. I'm planning on feeding that right back in. Right? And then how do I do that? So then I'm, I'm thinking about, I know, Matthew's telling me about the opportunity he's going and then it kind of opened up a whole other door, and then

@Chris Andrade [1:11:30]: I'll, I, I, you guys can see my screen, right?

@Trent [1:11:33]: I, yeah, I see it. Yeah.

@Chris Andrade [1:11:35]: OK, so,

@Matthew Kerns [1:11:37]: I, I can't. oh yeah, yeah.

@Chris Andrade [1:11:38]: I get a phone call, I get a phone call after talking to Matthew Remember that contract?

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [1:11:43]: Can you share your screen again

@Chris Andrade [1:11:44]: Huh?

@Trent [1:11:45]: All we, all I see is like us.

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [1:11:48]: Yeah, you're probably sharing our screen, like the video screen.

@Matthew Kerns [1:11:49]: Yeah

@Chris Andrade [1:11:51]: Oh shit, my fault. Yeah, I wonder what it did, oh what the hell? So, I How about now

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [1:12:02]: There we go. Yeah.

@Trent [1:12:02]: There we go. There we go, yep.

@Chris Andrade [1:12:04]: So after I got a call, after I talked to Matthew, I got a call from Juan from F1 Paving. Remember that contract that I told you I won for Remus development. Now it's total like 93,000. Anyways, he calls me because he knows that I'm a media guy, and he's like, dude, I, I got this really cool demo job, and it kind of just landed on my plate and I needed, I need to be out there tomorrow at one, but I need help with my social media, and that's what you do, right? I was like, yeah, bro, like yeah,

@Trent [1:12:12]: Yeah Yep.

@Chris Andrade [1:12:34]: Like, like let me, what do you need, you know? And then he starts telling me, I was like, sounds like you need more than social media, man. I was like, listen, I was like, do you know what, I have, you know why I'm not, cause I, I had to take a time of a leave of absence from Reus development, and he was like asking, what the fuck am I doing? And I was like, listen man, I had to break it down to him.

@Chris Andrade [1:12:55]: I was like, I told him about our agencies, I sent him the website. Again, Mel, like he fucking was like, damn, you guys did this in like less than a week. I was like, I mean, the guys did it. I didn't do it, but the, the team did. I was like, you know, these guys are killers, dude, they're hungry and they are wanting to move really fast. So, I am trying to now facilitate things for us to kind of accomplish here, right? And I think we can help you accom

@Trent [1:13:23]: Yeah

@Chris Andrade [1:13:25]: Pl ish ing He's like, dude, can you guys create an app? And I was like, I don't see why we can't. I was like, we're designing software specialty for, you know, company. He's like, I don't want, I've tried to, he apparently he's done some research. He's already known how much it's going to cost to develop this thing in his brain.

@Chris Andrade [1:13:44]: But apparently he thinks that this thing in his brain is worth a lot of money. Right? And he can't find a team to help develop it, but he already told me that he spent time to research how much it was gonna cost.

@Trent [1:13:49]: Yeah

@Chris Andrade [1:13:58]: He already has a budget put away for it, and it's like, hm, OK. Yeah, so then I was like, whoa, I was like, he's like, well, how much are you gonna charge for the drone stuff in the videography. I was like, well, normally I charge $150 an hour, especially if it's on an impromptu meeting that you're telling me that I've got less than 24 hours of prep for it, and I got to drive fucking 45 minutes to go take care of. He's like, but normally I charge you $150 but if you're telling me what you're telling me is true, and you know, you got something that you need help

@Trent [1:14:02]: Got money just sitting there to spend on it, yeah.

@Chris Andrade [1:14:28]: With, I'm gonna give you the media shit. Like, now I'm just going to go take pictures and give you drawn stuff like for free, because now there's an opportunity for me to learn about your business and how I can help you in another way. And he's like, really? It's like, yeah. I was like, this is what we do, and now you have the same that you need help with an app. I was like, dude, I got 3 of the best developers I've ever met. I was like, let's do, let me introduce you to him, you know what I mean? And

@Chris Andrade [1:14:56]: So that's what I, I, I just remember I had to plug in my drone right now because now I have this photoshoot that I got to go run over there and do, and I'm like, Now I'm hearing that you guys have Offers or things or again, like construction is mine, right? And not only construction, we have also the shed business, right? And those are my two little niches, and you have your niche. Mika, you have your niche.

@Trent [1:15:13]: Nothing

@Chris Andrade [1:15:25]: Matthew, you have your niche, right? I don't see why we can't find a way in the next, today's the 10th, fellas. We got exactly 4 weeks to figure out if we can extend our one way, or if we need to stop it, right? I stop it, but we really gotta reduce our effort towards the Arise group, and I don't want that to happen. So if, if we can figure out a way

@Trent [1:15:47]: Yeah

@Chris Andrade [1:15:51]: I think we can lock in our onboarding process and kill our first delivery opportunity with plotter mechanics by Wednesday next week. that's up to you guys to determine. After that, I think I really truly think that Kelsey would be able to put 50 down.

@Chris Andrade [1:16:12]: To initiate us to continue to partnering up with him. I really truly do that. As far as is he gonna write us a check? Can we do some installation payments? I don't know. We'll figure that out, but At this point, if we can figure out a way to get your guys' runway to go a little further to maybe now we went from January, we could get that runway to slide into February.

@Trent [1:16:32]: Yeah. Yeah

@Chris Andrade [1:16:38]: Then the and then and then that runway now actually and we just picked up another one and now we just slid that runway to march, like it's gonna just continuing to go.

@Trent [1:16:47]: Yep, and we just, we just build because as, as we're, we're creating these, our systems, our processes, our we're, we're building our testimonials, or whatever, our toolbox and our portfolio, we have more ammo for the next.

@Chris Andrade [1:16:53]: So, yeah.

@Trent [1:17:03]: Opportunity, and we also have work that we can just replicate, so it's easier and faster for us to do. So,

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [1:17:10]: We're doing the hard work now. This is the hardest part. Our first like few projects, figuring out our process, the first few projects are gonna be rough, but after that, I don't see.

@Trent [1:17:12]: Just just Yeah.

@Chris Andrade [1:17:18]: And you guys, come on, let's be real here. Let's all be real, like, is this really rough or is it fun?

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [1:17:19]: Why not, yeah. No, this is fun. I, I enjoy this.

@Chris Andrade [1:17:24]: Yeah.

@Trent [1:17:25]: It's fun

@Chris Andrade [1:17:26]: You know what I'm saying? Like, if this is rough and it's fun, like holy shit dude, like come on.

@Trent [1:17:28]: Yeah Well it It's gonna be a little bumpy because we're trying to like push really hard and get this done, right? And we need to have revenue to be able to support ourselves so that we can continue doing it. And that's

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [1:17:37]: Yeah.

@Chris Andrade [1:17:41]: And I That's the

@Trent [1:17:43]: That's the balance in between putting the effort in now so that we can pay off later.

@Chris Andrade [1:17:48]: And, and, and I, I, I like, I'm gonna play devil's advocate here. I don't see that happening, but let's say if it does, and we have to do engagements in our own personal life. I don't, we're still gonna keep plugging and eventually something's gonna come in and then it's gonna be able to alleviate one of you, hopefully two of you, maybe all three of you, you know what I'm saying? But as long as we still keep plugging, it's gonna happen, dude. It's gonna happen. And it's just that's if we can prove, get this proof of concept done as fast as humanly possible, so you guys feel comfortable enough now to push this on to your needs.

@Trent [1:18:30]: Yeah.

@Chris Andrade [1:18:31]: And then Honestly, I mean, Not, we're only have we only have a floodgate right now that's this. Once we can Initiate your guys' gates to be open. Now we just tripled that.

@Trent [1:18:45]: Yeah, I know

@Chris Andrade [1:18:45]: And who knows what will happen, right? And I'm really potential and hopeful for that. So I've been having this pulled up on my screen. I just want to run through you real quick on what I'm thinking on on takeoffs. So remember Matthew, remember the details, the construction notes. So,

@Trent [1:18:46]: I. Yup Yeah And I, I interrupt just for a second. Are we, are we steering around to Remus development? Is that what this is?

@Chris Andrade [1:19:01]: For instance Yeah, well, this is, this is this is honestly, so yes, this is Remus, but this is, let's just, this is construction, that the takeoff. So this, this section of notes that we're gonna talk about is what I think is a

@Trent [1:19:13]: Construction job.

@Chris Andrade [1:19:21]: A like this this is a billion dollar industry, and it is seriously untapped, OK? So when I say takeoff, this is the very first stage to generating a proposal, right? I have to cross reference these construction notes, for instance,

@Chris Andrade [1:19:42]: Construct six-inch vertical curve, and you see this This section right here, this is a mag standard. This is a universal language that we have, there's a spec chart in here, right? So that's interesting. We really need to download this, like this is an easy win for Remus's development

@Chris Andrade [1:20:03]: Is to download this Download this, Deals so we can reference. Right? for Remus development. Oh, that's not it. It's not a bitch. But

@Chris Andrade [1:20:22]: So this standard is a a home for everybody to know how, like, what the inspector shows up on the job site, the this is the inspector's playbook. So nobody has any

@Matthew Kerns [1:20:35]: So

@Chris Andrade [1:20:37]: Like questions to what is.

@Matthew Kerns [1:20:37]: And is it, is it per city?

@Chris Andrade [1:20:40]: Yes, every city has its own mag standard detail, right? So

@Matthew Kerns [1:20:40]: Is it, was it?

@Trent [1:20:45]: And we wouldn't worry about doing multi-city until we have the step that concept kind of

@Chris Andrade [1:20:49]: Right, right, this, but It all boils down to this, right?

@Trent [1:20:53]: Right, right, yeah, but yeah, we would, we would.

@Chris Andrade [1:20:55]: So this 6 inch Vertical curve

@Trent [1:20:57]: Good Yeah

@Chris Andrade [1:20:59]: Is the same six-inch vertical curve on every single set of plans that come in, right? Same thing with all these details, these are all the same exact details on every single plan. The only thing that changes is the application that it's going to. So this is a break plus that we bidded on for Scottsdale.

@Chris Andrade [1:21:20]: So you see, these are the line items right here. So these pipeballers, right? They're you see how they're highlighted. I can take this

@Trent [1:21:27]: Yep

@Chris Andrade [1:21:29]: Document after running through these takeoffs. And I can export this document as a PDF. Now, my thought process here is if we had a way to be able to go in and say, OK, I need to do this takeoff. I need to know details. So you have a legend, right?

@Chris Andrade [1:21:51]: Construction notes, there's a triangle, there's a circle, and there's a square, right? Those triangles, like sometimes you'll have multiple details on one page, but triangles are for concrete squares for rating, circles for utilities, right? So

@Chris Andrade [1:22:12]: I need to pull out detail number 10, install 4 inch wide yellow, you also, so this is a striping, right? And It would have this marked up on the page, right? This is when I say I have $500,000 spent doing this.

@Chris Andrade [1:22:34]: This is what I mean. We went through thousands of pages Of Details to generate this color code system that references this detail that is categorized in a spreadsheet. So if there was a way we could take this spreadsheet to reference this detail to ultimately get confirmation of the detail with the color code PDF.

@Chris Andrade [1:23:02]: Like

@Trent [1:23:07]: How are those totals all calculated? Is that automatic or did you punch them in there or what?

@Chris Andrade [1:23:12]: Yeah, so, so then what I do here, so let me see, so this is, so it, this is Oh why my internet's so slow? So it comes out from here. So now I have a quantification, right?

@Chris Andrade [1:23:29]: Of let's just say On this page

@Trent [1:23:33]: Yeah.

@Chris Andrade [1:23:33]: So it only looks like there is one page, so this is a small one. So on this page, I had 218.75 lean your feet.

@Trent [1:23:42]: And you can export this, you can download it in XLS, and it ultimately calculates that, OK.

@Chris Andrade [1:23:42]: Of Yeah, so then Yep, so then my next step then is I bring it over here, right?

@Trent [1:23:48]: But So first you need to know the standard, then you need to know the quantity of each. Item Right Now you're going over here, OK?

@Chris Andrade [1:24:00]: Yeah. And I'll have this all recorded, but this is, I'm just showing you the end result. Let, let's see that I, let me go to one that I know.

@Trent [1:24:13]: Cause so far what you just mentioned, being able to take a standard and being able to apply it to an Excel spreadsheet that has numbers in it is a piece of cake.

@Chris Andrade [1:24:13]: Oh, I Got. So these are the big guys, so this guy, this is Guardian.

@Trent [1:24:25]: Yeah. Yeah

@Chris Andrade [1:24:28]: I'm pointing this out because we are going to be working with Guardian here soon. I, the guy, the head estimator for Guardian, I am cahoots with Dude, this guy is gonna be our ticket maker once we get ready for this grading side of things, but for instance, let me come down here

@Chris Andrade [1:24:48]: And which one did I do? I did all of them, but which one do I know? I think, no, not this one Son of but I hate SharePoint. God damn it.

@Trent [1:25:01]: It can be a pain in the ass sometimes, I think.

@Chris Andrade [1:25:03]: Dude, he's like, like this is what I mean by if I can hire a rise group to come into my environment to set up some automation through our environment, like that is something that I need desperately, just to even go through my freaking emails.

@Chris Andrade [1:25:22]: So childhood, oh yeah, childhood. So bidden estimates, right? So again, concrete proposals. So this is actually the proposal, I forgot we needed to take off, so I have my takeoff folder Right here

@Chris Andrade [1:25:40]: This is what, so after the fact, let me just hide all of these. Oops. No All Unpack Damn it, it's only one page, son of a bitch. Well, I, what I do is then I, I manually have to come in here and I create this

@Chris Andrade [1:26:05]: Column, and then I equal sum This isn't a good example Well, I mean, if you guys want me to keep running through it, but you see where I'm going, right?

@Trent [1:26:16]: Yeah, if you want, if you wanna just do like, so the hardest part here is

@Chris Andrade [1:26:16]: This is

@Trent [1:26:22]: Honestly just giving it to you in a usable format. One like couple inputs in and then spitting it back out for you. If you just need it like Excel file in standard file standards file in, and then Excel file out. I mean, it's

@Chris Andrade [1:26:37]: A825.

@Trent [1:26:37]: Should be pretty straightforward.

@Chris Andrade [1:26:40]: This this is what I mean, like, I have, like, if we can figure out a way to keep putting progress towards something when we have downtime, we need to figure out that how that looks because honestly, we should be consistently working on something. Right now we're working on our, our rollout, our protocol, our introduction, our handshake, and once we say, OK, this is complete.

@Chris Andrade [1:27:05]: What's next Like, what do we keep tackling, right? I don't how do we find out, how, where does that list live? What is that list look like?

@Matthew Kerns [1:27:11]: Yeah

@Trent [1:27:15]: Yeah, we need a, we need a wish list, right? Or like a ideas list or like I have 1,0001 ideas that I've come up with for the engineering aspect of industrial automation. So I'm just like.

@Chris Andrade [1:27:25]: And then you're like, OK, so and now we have 4 lists, and they're 1 mile long, which one of those, like, how do we get that?

@Trent [1:27:34]: And we didn't op opportunity matrix for ourselves.

@Chris Andrade [1:27:38]: No shit, no shit, like straight up.

@Matthew Kerns [1:27:39]: Yeah

@Trent [1:27:42]: Yeah

@Chris Andrade [1:27:42]: No shit. And what is it like, I think Let's get this plot of mechanics going. Let's get, let's just focus up and really hone in on that because I think we could, that's a really good easy win that we can get probably a contract signed by the end of next week for.

@Chris Andrade [1:27:58]: And then I mean, it's just, these are things that I'm like thinking of as we keep going forward, you know, but I got this whole environment just chilling. And

@Trent [1:28:12]: So Yeah, so I think where we are right now is that we need to get the, the assets created that are client facing, so get our numbers, details, whatever it is that we have water mechanics.

@Chris Andrade [1:28:24]: I like teenagers.

@Trent [1:28:27]: Using the three-step framework, creating the assets that are in our

@Matthew Kerns [1:28:28]: Yeah

@Trent [1:28:33]: Using our detail, Ready to show to Kelsey, and then we need to craft our offer on what that's going to be, which is going to be our audit. Plus teeing up for the next The next step Right? So we need to give him a vision on what it looks like for the next step beyond the audit. We can show in the audit and give them a pretty good idea of what kind of outcome he's going to have from the audit. Out of the audit, he's going to know his best opportunities that he should consider going forward with, and then once we choose an opportunity, or 3 or 4, or whatever they are, what does that look like?

@Trent [1:29:12]: So that's what we need to, we need to craft that.

@Chris Andrade [1:29:16]: Yeah, so I, I, I'll just stay focused on on that alone right now, but I guess what I'm trying to say here is that I don't see why we can't extend our runway

@Trent [1:29:27]: Yeah

@Chris Andrade [1:29:27]: Come January

@Trent [1:29:28]: OK. Yeah, and, and I'm, I'm good and I think that if I can get some money, some revenue in January, I can extend to February. So

@Chris Andrade [1:29:39]: Well then, you know, I, and I'm Mel and Matthew, like I don't know if that's the same situation for you, but whatever I can do or, you know, what whatever you need, I, I expressed that you just in like let us know what you need if you're in a bind like we're kind of like we're straight up guys, like, we're family, like, be honest, like, we're straight up family right now, so if you guys need something, just kind of just let it be know

@Trent [1:29:39]: I

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [1:29:44]: So

@Chris Andrade [1:30:09]: N that you need something and and and we'll figure it out, but we know what we got. We're putting in a lot of work to get just this far, but look, it's only been fucking like

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [1:30:11]: Hm.

@Chris Andrade [1:30:23]: 12 days, like legit, you know, and like the what we have achieved in 12 days. That like that's how I know this is gonna work. And now we, we have this, we have this beautiful onboarding process that we're honing in on. I don't see why we can't extend or get at least 2 contracts.

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [1:30:35]: Thank

@Chris Andrade [1:30:47]: By January 1st

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [1:30:49]: I agree. That should be our goal overall, like 23 sign projects and deliver

@Chris Andrade [1:30:51]: Yeah.

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [1:30:54]: Around the new year, like once the New Year starts.

@Chris Andrade [1:30:55]: Yeah, I, I don't see why we can't do that. I just don't.

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [1:30:58]: I see what you're saying, Chris, though. I, I, I see what you're saying. It's just like this first one, right? Like we're kind of in the middle of like just figuring out how that client experience works out. As soon as we figure that out, I don't see why not. We could go into like an acquisition phase, you could focus on acquisition and then

@Chris Andrade [1:31:02]: You know.

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [1:31:12]: Once we get them signed, they'll come in to fulfillment, so I, I don't why not.

@Chris Andrade [1:31:16]: So I'm gonna propose I'm gonna, I'm gonna say for me personally, I am not gonna mention anything else Except plotting mechanics. And I am going to Just focus up or, you know, like, is there anything that I need that I can do right now to help get us there for plotter mechanics.

@Trent [1:31:41]: Well, I think that that really segues into, hey, we have to get these details in place. So Matthew had suggested That we We all take a run at being able to build out a process or an opportunity matrix.

@Trent [1:31:59]: My question to that would be, What, what's the long term? Who's gonna do that? Like, like long term, it's not going to be all four of us doing the steps Every time. So it, are we all gonna do all the steps right now, or are we gonna divvy up the work

@Trent [1:32:18]: And then come back together To, to get it done.

@Matthew Kerns [1:32:21]: Well, yeah, that's a good question cause I don't think that that's kind of like The simplest Just basic, like, I don't know if that's what we actually end up doing, because it is duplicating work at the end of the day, where we're all doing the same thing.

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [1:32:36]: Yeah. It it's

@Trent [1:32:38]: Necessary for us to go through the steps as as an individual for each of us to understand that for the first pass, and then, and then once we understand it, we can, we can assign it to someone as being, you know, it might be on a project by project basis, but it gets assigned to somebody that does it.

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [1:32:42]: I just think it Yeah Yeah. 100%. And I think Matthew, like I think by doing it, everyone doing it too, we can understand it that way we could sell it better because that is our first offer, right? And

@Matthew Kerns [1:33:04]: Yeah Yeah, I definitely want to go through it that time.

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [1:33:05]: And just for this first one too, if we all do it and then come together, and then figuring out of how it should actually look together, and then everyone knows the standard of it, then we can go off iterating it, you know.

@Trent [1:33:16]: Yeah. I, I think that

@Chris Andrade [1:33:17]: Yeah

@Trent [1:33:18]: Good.

@Chris Andrade [1:33:19]: Are you talking about us doing our own version of the opportunity matrix that we see.

@Trent [1:33:25]: I think so, yes. I, I think.

@Matthew Kerns [1:33:25]: For for mic.

@Trent [1:33:28]: Just for plotter mechanics, we're not trying to do anything right now other than potter mechanics because we're using them as our examples since they're the closest to, to, an opportunity that we can seal, right? So, I would say that if we can do

@Chris Andrade [1:33:30]: Right, right, right, right

@Matthew Kerns [1:33:40]: Yes

@Trent [1:33:42]: We can take the information that we have. And then create an create like a process flow canvas. And I don't even care, like personally in my mind, I don't think it matters how detailed it is right now. Just put in what you know.

@Chris Andrade [1:33:59]: Honestly

@Trent [1:33:59]: Or what you think you

@Chris Andrade [1:34:00]: Yeah, I see what you're saying, and, and for me right now, the my best way to kind of do is like literally just kind of just, cause I still haven't set up my environment, like you guys have, and so I just wanna do it on pen and paper, or my remarkable.

@Trent [1:34:10]: I, I

@Chris Andrade [1:34:15]: More remarkable

@Trent [1:34:15]: Yeah You can do it that way. Yeah. I don't have a problem like, I think that it's fine with Everyone doing it their own way if they want to. what I can offer is that I have the draw IO file that I can give to everybody. It doesn't

@Chris Andrade [1:34:32]: No, he had the

@Trent [1:34:33]: It doesn't matter if you have clawed code or not. You can go and download the app or you can do it on the web where you open it up and you can just do whatever it is you need to, and it's the type.

@Chris Andrade [1:34:42]: He sent me that then or it's on, you said it's on motion.

@Trent [1:34:46]: I, I don't have it there currently. I haven't given it to anybody. I can't.

@Chris Andrade [1:34:49]: OK, got you. Yeah, I think if you got that already in drawing IO and then yeah, then I can run with it. I think that's a very good, like, I, I don't think it's like a, a homework assignment, but it does, it would be cool to see everyone's different perspective on their own matrix that they think they can provide. So I think that's a really good little brain sash, for sure.

@Trent [1:34:50]: Yeah

@Trent [1:35:09]: And And then, and then be able to maybe describe how you did it or what you did or something like that just so that we can like zero in on the best way or method to just get that done.

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [1:35:17]: All this.

@Chris Andrade [1:35:23]: You got, you got

@Trent [1:35:23]: Right? So, I mean, if you wanna, if you wanna do it manually and you want to draw it out on your remarks.

@Chris Andrade [1:35:28]: No, no, no, no, I forgot that you mentioned about the dot aisle file, and I have already set up, so yeah, I

@Trent [1:35:29]: For

@Matthew Kerns [1:35:34]: So maybe it might be really good too, like we, we, like if we get different perspectives on just how each of us does it, and we bring those all together. Then we can really like refine the the process.

@Chris Andrade [1:35:47]: Yeah, cause we all have our way of methodology, right? It makes us unique and knows what which one works better than the other one, like for real, so yeah.

@Matthew Kerns [1:35:48]: The works. Yeah

@Trent [1:35:55]: Exactly, exactly

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [1:35:57]: Our, our topic, tomorrow, just everyone just go present their their way, their opportunity matrix or

@Trent [1:36:04]: I, I think that's our action item right now is that if we can build a process map, whatever, whatever detail you think you can get in there. It doesn't matter what it is. Use whatever notes we have, build a process this ops canvas that I'm I'm not showing it to you guys, but it's just for clarity, I'm just gonna share it.

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [1:36:04]: And then

@Trent [1:36:22]: So, this ops canvas OK, just do whatever you can do. Obviously, we don't have this much detail.

@Chris Andrade [1:36:30]: Right

@Trent [1:36:31]: Just place it on there and just connect some dots and put some comments in there. What you can do, and then the next thing is this. So write down, either take take what we have from Kelsey. And take what we have from all the notes that Chris did, and just

@Trent [1:36:49]: Drop them on this Either your own ideas or Chris's ideas or Kelsey's ideas, just put them on The Matrix and You could, if you want to do a scoring system yourself, if you want to come up with a way of saying, oh, the You want to do like, you want to get complicated with it, go for it. Otherwise, as simple as just, OK, I think an inventory management system is gonna to take high effort to implement, and, but it has good return and you just drop it in there.

@Trent [1:37:17]: Like I think that if we can just do these two things All together And then, well, maybe not together, but do them separately and then bring them back together so we can see the different perspectives and methods.

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [1:37:25]: That We got like Cause that in itself needs to be an internal process for us, and we all need to understand it intimately, and then that's, that's, that's just gonna help us operate better, faster, smoother, and take out multiple clients at the same time. The, the quicker we get this process down, nailed down internally, the quicker we'll be able to identify opportunities and high value, client or whatever it may be.

@Trent [1:37:32]: Yeah Yeah

@Trent [1:37:49]: Yeah

@Chris Andrade [1:37:51]: OK, right

@Trent [1:37:51]: So I If you want to do it with the draw files, I will put it in the, I will put it in the notion is probably the

@Chris Andrade [1:37:59]: It

@Trent [1:38:00]: Or I could put it in slack. It doesn't matter to me.

@Chris Andrade [1:38:03]: Yeah

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [1:38:03]: I'd say no, I'd say notion cause there's a lot of good stuff in there. I tried to, I watched, I watched the video yesterday. I tried to walk through it. I probably got caught up. I, I, I got the extension, grabbed the MD file. There's probably one step I'm missing, but would have helped it

@Trent [1:38:16]: Oh. Well, let me, let me show you real quick. Just set Claude Code aside for a second.

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [1:38:22]: OK.

@Trent [1:38:23]: Set that aside, and you can literally just go to draw

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [1:38:27]: Drawn that out

@Trent [1:38:28]: Uh.io. So they're, they're one and the same company, so Drawio.com is going to steer you towards paying for them? OK

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [1:38:39]: Mhm

@Trent [1:38:39]: Draw.io is the app. OK? And you can open it up in here, so I'll show you. I can just open it real quick.

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [1:38:46]: Yeah.

@Chris Andrade [1:38:47]: Through my Google and actually opened it up through there.

@Trent [1:38:50]: Yeah, so I'll just show you real quick. I can just open from, device, and I'm just gonna show you, I'm gonna open it up right in here, My Agentic workflows. My diet accounts, my

@Chris Andrade [1:39:03]: Ouch Ouch, shit

@Trent [1:39:07]: The opportunity matrix is right here, so I just hit open, OK. So yeah, it's in black, so it looks a little bit different. I can change the way that this looks, right?

@Chris Andrade [1:39:15]: I like that. I, I mean,

@Trent [1:39:18]: But, but regardless, if you guys want it in a different like format or something, I can make the texts and the colors and stuff, all that different, really easily. So if you, if you start getting into it like this, and you think that it doesn't work well with the dark format. You can probably just change the theme real quick.

@Chris Andrade [1:39:36]: I like the dark format me personally, I think it's easier to see, but

@Trent [1:39:39]: I do too

@Chris Andrade [1:39:40]: Yeah.

@Trent [1:39:40]: I do too. But I think that the colors are too dark for what we're trying to achieve, but anyway, my point is that you can just go online and do it here, or, or you can go to

@Chris Andrade [1:39:46]: Yeah. All right

@Trent [1:39:59]: Well

@Chris Andrade [1:40:03]: That's it. I'm changing my tabar to be on the side. I'm doing it

@Trent [1:40:11]: Yeah, so this one here is not what we want. This right here, this websiteraio-app is not what you want. So draw IO IO.com There. So drawio.com.

@Trent [1:40:28]: Will take you here where you can just click download and then you can run it as an application. You don't have to do it on the web

@Chris Andrade [1:40:36]: But

@Trent [1:40:36]: So I'm running it here on my Mac as well. And you can download it for Windows, Mac, doesn't matter, OK? As an application. So now you can open diagrams wherever. OK.

@Trent [1:40:53]: So, I guess what I was just trying to get at was that there's more than one way to do this. But it's all, you don't have to do cloud code if you don't want. But Mikel, if you wanna do or anybody wants to do Claude Code version, if you're having trouble with it, let me know. There might be some preliminary steps we've got to get you set up with to do it.

@Trent [1:41:16]: OK? So like, now that I have it in cloud code, there's an extension. So the extension, you just go into the little block button, go to extensions and you just type in draw.io OK.

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [1:41:31]: Yeah, I did that and then it, it just says diagram not found or like it's not, not a diagram file here, let me just show I can show you real quick.

@Trent [1:41:31]: And right there Yep That's fine So I can give you the file and you can just open it up in this free diagramming software and you can manually just drop stuff where you believe it needs to be. if you want to get fancy and use cloud code, I can show you how to do that too. So.

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [1:41:57]: You guys see my screen? Oh, I'm tripping like

@Trent [1:42:00]: I see, yeah, there you go

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [1:42:01]: Times.

@Trent [1:42:03]: Not a diagram file. That's because it's must not be in the right format.

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [1:42:10]: So I put the MD in the I created a dark folder, put it in there. And then I got the extension and then I generated, I wanted it to generate a diagram of like, the actual

@Trent [1:42:16]: OK.

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [1:42:24]: Like process of itself that I mapped up.

@Trent [1:42:25]: Yeah.

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [1:42:27]: And I told her to do that and put it into a drawer that IO, and then I just kept getting this error and then I popped up popped.

@Trent [1:42:33]: Yeah, it's, it, it's somehow got, so start here, create a fresh instance of clawed code somehow, either open up a new, actually that top right window. Is fine Yeah, that, you can have this one right here that you actually have your cursor over top of. This is cloud code, yeah, that one. So just type in that one.

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [1:42:51]: Yeah.

@Trent [1:42:55]: Let's just test it real quick and just tell it, say, hey, I just want you to test the generate diagram, diagram directive Just create me a simple diagram

@Trent [1:43:17]: Right now, you also have in focus your generate diagram, as you can see in your right there, yup, that's fine. I'm just pointing out that that is It, it knows to look at that when you have it as a, see how it's reading at first. And then just, yup, guess it

@Chris Andrade [1:43:32]: Whoa.

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [1:43:35]: He

@Trent [1:43:38]: Let it do its thing

@Chris Andrade [1:43:38]: Hey, do we went to recycling now? Did I drop like that? That's shit

@Trent [1:43:44]: You can also, if you toggle wars is asked before edits to like, You can change that so it doesn't ask as much. See it says ask before edits down at the bottom there, bottom left.

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [1:43:53]: 00

@Trent [1:43:56]: And inside the queue under other message like where your chat box is.

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [1:44:00]: Yeah

@Trent [1:44:00]: Yeah, click that. There you go. So now it'll ask you less. Doesn't mean it won't ask you. I just ask you less.

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [1:44:01]: Oh

@Trent [1:44:17]: There might also be, let me look at my directive real quick,

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [1:44:32]: So it didn't, they said it can provide the content, but

@Trent [1:44:39]: An environment issue with the command execution. Provide you with a diagram content.

@Matthew Kerns [1:44:49]: So another way is a mermaid diagrams. So I've done that before just to do architectural decodes and cloud and just do it at the books.

@Trent [1:44:53]: Yes. Yeah. So So I went down that path I went down that path. The problem with mermaid diagrams is that you don't get a visual editor To be able to modify them. So, I, I pulled out of that real quick because

@Trent [1:45:12]: It's not easy to do manual edits. You have to know how to do the the mermaid syntax and type it in and then have a viewer that that

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [1:45:15]: Yeah

@Trent [1:45:21]: Like I was like, well, yeah, it can generate it. Yeah, it can actually be pretty fancy looking. I was like That that's why I steered out of it

@Matthew Kerns [1:45:33]: Yeah, you can mop it with the language, but

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [1:45:34]: What I could do is

@Matthew Kerns [1:45:37]: But yeah, if you can't get the fine tuned detail, and just visually do it, then maybe that's, that's a problem. But whatever works at the end of the day

@Trent [1:45:46]: At the end of the day, what I'm open to whatever anybody comes up with, but this was the reason that I went draw IO was it was free, it's user-intuitive to where you can, you can just move things around and change the styles and change the connections, and it's an XML fort mat on the back end, so, Claude Coke can easily create it. right now it's running into an environment issue on McKells. Now, I'm, I'm running on a Mac

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [1:46:14]: Yeah.

@Trent [1:46:14]: And you're running on Windows, so there might be something there that it doesn't quite understand.

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [1:46:16]: Yeah. Yeah, I'll mess around. I'll mess around a bit later, but I, I got pulled in on my boss is calling me on the side. I'm gonna catch up with you guys in a little bit, if you guys need anything from me, I'll be back on in like 20 minutes or so.

@Trent [1:46:26]: But on.

@Chris Andrade [1:46:30]: OK

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [1:46:32]: He's probably tucky as it.

@Trent [1:46:32]: See you.

@Chris Andrade [1:46:34]: I think this routine. I think this is gonna be my new I come home. I'm gonna pop in here, right around 5:30, 6 o'clock in the morning. So if anybody is on at the same time, I could just, we could just hop in on this. There's.

@Trent [1:46:49]: Yeah, I mean, I mean, any, from 8:15 Eastern. Till about 9:30, I mean, we're past 9:30 now, but I mean, we've been on here for a couple hours, and it's, it's crazy how fast a couple hours goes.

@Chris Andrade [1:47:05]: I know but I really like being able to Just get so much done by 8 o'clock, cause yesterday we, we had a lot done, but it was already by like new. And I was like, damn man, half the day's already gone.

@Trent [1:47:25]: Yeah, so I'm trying to

@Chris Andrade [1:47:26]: You remind me of how much work I put in the draw.io. And I'm so curious to see if it Has to still be here

@Trent [1:47:40]: You already had draw die.

@Chris Andrade [1:47:43]: Mhm.

@Trent [1:47:43]: At that point. Yeah, cause I

@Chris Andrade [1:47:45]: All Mhm

@Trent [1:47:47]: By default, it wants to save everything that Google Drive. Which I like

@Chris Andrade [1:47:51]: Yeah

@Trent [1:47:53]: So,

@Chris Andrade [1:47:55]: Oh

@Trent [1:47:56]: But You're opening it up for a first time in a while and you're like, whoa, what was all this stuff I did?

@Chris Andrade [1:48:02]: I, I think I like this has all of my Information security ones. Fully forgot about. Greener development.

@Trent [1:48:16]: Yeah, so I'm just gonna try to get inside a notion. I'm gonna try to put these two files.

@Chris Andrade [1:48:24]: To back that in your body. We got to play And we'll put him on top, OK.

@Chris Andrade [1:48:51]: There's kind of exciting to hear about what You you're gonna be working with your old boss is. Like your client

@Trent [1:48:57]: Oh yeah, Yeah, I mean, he could be a client and I mean, they have a lot of potential, I mean, it's like, it, it could go A little bit bumpy depending on his relationship with the other owners and the other board members and stuff. So that's the thing that I'm most cautious of, but, but he

@Chris Andrade [1:49:20]: I

@Trent [1:49:23]: He is very much a tech guy. Like, I mean, as soon as I started talking to him about this. I mean, he's like, yeah, he's like, I'm already using cursor, and he's like, I'm already using, you know, AI to do this and that. He's already using AI himself, but his mission is to try to implement it and inject it into their business.

@Trent [1:49:41]: So that

@Chris Andrade [1:49:42]: And I think it was Liam that I've heard it from. He's like, we're not trying to build you AI tools. We're trying to use AI tools. I

@Trent [1:49:51]: To help you better, right? So like he, so the way I see it and the way that I could explain it to somebody is that AI, we are an AI transformation partner and what that gets you is two things. We are AI native, so we use AI for almost everything we can so that we can get you better results faster, and then also, we can help you, right? Implement them into your business.

@Chris Andrade [1:49:53]: Yeah.

@Trent [1:50:15]: So, that's kind of like the way I see it.

@Chris Andrade [1:50:17]: It it it and again, that's where I'm like keying in on those sprays like we are Information detectives? No.

@Trent [1:50:27]: Yeah, yeah, we're, well, inefficiency, inefficiency.

@Chris Andrade [1:50:30]: Inefficient, thank you

@Trent [1:50:31]: Yeah, yeah, yeah, inefficiency detectives. So we're, we're looking for the inefficiencies in the business that we can help with, right?

@Chris Andrade [1:50:34]: Yeah So this is what I started, man, this is a long time ago. I was trying to figure out how many opportunities are we losing per day? Right? And this is all these gray boxes.

@Chris Andrade [1:50:51]: These, I'm sorry, all and these are channels of how these potential leads could come in. Dude, look how many channels there are. All these orange ones are channels, right?

@Trent [1:51:03]: Yeah

@Chris Andrade [1:51:07]: Oh, so what did I do down here? Oh shit, I did do some water attendance. Oh yeah. Dude, I totally forgot. This is when I was like, brainstorming how long this would work.

@Chris Andrade [1:51:28]: Dude, I forgot, I did this. It's so funny seeing the notes that you took from

@Chris Andrade [1:51:45]: Oh this is when I had the the homozy moment. How much cool shit can I give away? Repeated Go

@Trent [1:51:57]: Yeah, yep, master it, then make it repeatable. Then that's where the money comes in, right there. Print and cash, buddy.

@Chris Andrade [1:52:05]: Yep, pretty money model 101.

@Trent [1:52:09]: Yeah. Just

@Chris Andrade [1:52:11]: Dude, yeah, I can't wait to be able to import this since my time. Again, like this is just sitting here waiting for us to tackle. But I think let's get those easy wins and then I would like to eventually move into wolf sheds cause I think that would be a really easy one.

@Chris Andrade [1:52:31]: When 2 is just a basic CRM rollout. For them But The monetary side might be a little bit of a challenge on the monthly. Billables

@Trent [1:52:47]: Yeah.

@Chris Andrade [1:52:48]: For them at the moment. All right, well, I got lots of work to do. I got, I'm gonna start working on that. did you upload that to No shit by any chance?

@Trent [1:53:00]: Yeah, I'm actually, I'm, I'm showing where it is in ocean, in the chat right now. I'm trying to anyway. Yeah, and then I'm sharing the link too

@Trent [1:53:17]: OK, so in this chat, this huddle chat. Is I put one process map and then two opportunity matrix. Those are the two things that we're trying to Work on And yeah, if you, you click there

@Trent [1:53:35]: That's the preview of the document, and then those are the two files that you can download. I mean you can, you can import those into drawIO and then you, you can work with them, OK? So, that gets us, you know, moving pretty quickly and creating something relatively uniform.

@Chris Andrade [1:53:39]: No Sweet Sweet, yep Yep.

@Trent [1:53:52]: All right

@Chris Andrade [1:53:52]: And it's May still on you? Yeah, you are.

@Trent [1:53:55]: He's, I think he is.

@Chris Andrade [1:53:57]: Stop Yeah, it looks like she's, well,

@Trent [1:54:00]: Yeah. He is, but he may, he may or may not be listening. Maybe he stepped away.

@Chris Andrade [1:54:03]: I just want like I just, I just want to Get you guys I just want to prove to you guys that we could make this work, but the only way we can prove it is by bringing the dollars in, which apparently we need do we have our payment processing figured out and how that's gonna be working.

@Trent [1:54:24]: I mean If we, if we have to, I have ways to bill and invoice and take payment and all that, but it's just not through a rise group, so we would have to talk to Mikkel about that.

@Chris Andrade [1:54:36]: Set up a strike or processing.

@Matthew Kerns [1:54:36]: Yeah it's

@Trent [1:54:39]: But I mean, I can take payment through Panda Doc, which is the same Same place that I would be creating an agreement. So if I'm creating an agreement for us for the service contract. Right? For the client I can attach a, a payment link using that. we can connect it to Stripe or PayPal or whatever or our bank accounts, whatever it is, or I can be.

@Chris Andrade [1:55:01]: I I think they probably because they take it fat percentage.

@Trent [1:55:06]: Yeah, 3% or some shit, yeah.

@Chris Andrade [1:55:07]: Yeah, yeah.

@Trent [1:55:09]: Yeah, I don't, I don't like to do that either. but it can also do like bank transfer, but I have ways that I can do it too. So I had to.

@Chris Andrade [1:55:14]: OK. OK, yeah, and I, again, I'm not worried. I just more or less wanna just be able to seamlessly offer that, the only thing that we're gonna have, I'm sorry, go ahead.

@Trent [1:55:22]: Yeah. The way I Yeah, I was gonna say the way that I take payment from my current client is that I send them an invoice via QuickBooks, and then while they can go and click the link to use QuickBooks to transfer via bank, like ACH. They can do that. QuickBooks likes to take a piece.

@Chris Andrade [1:55:39]: Yeah Mhm

@Trent [1:55:43]: So, so to save them a little money, I tell them, hey, I can give you my bank account details and you can just

@Chris Andrade [1:55:49]: Yeah, that's how I do it. I do all my vendors all through ACHs just for that reason.

@Trent [1:55:54]: Yeah. Yeah, yeah. I, I have yet to find a way to do it for free, the ACH, other than giving them my bank details.

@Chris Andrade [1:55:55]: So, and, and Yeah, well, our bank does it. We think we have a our, I, I gotta double check on that. I'm pretty sure our bank gets all of our transfers, sends all our transfers through our bank app.

@Chris Andrade [1:56:14]: I have to look into that

@Trent [1:56:15]: Yeah, so But, but like for the way that I've had to set it up with all my clients up to now is They ask me for my bank details, and they use that, they set it up in their system to transfer the money to me.

@Chris Andrade [1:56:33]: Do you become a vendor, so you have your W9 and your ACH information, all that sent up, yeah, that makes sense.

@Trent [1:56:35]: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, yep, yeah, I send them all that, yeah, cause they have a process they usually go through that they give me.

@Chris Andrade [1:56:43]: We'll have to pretty much do the same thing, especially moving forward, that we'll have to have that documentation ready and then what I was gonna say and we'll have to make sure Mika is aware of this. My only concern with requesting a money from Kelsey is that I preconceived the notion that we would like the money model, right, of giving it away for free, but it's that is different.

@Chris Andrade [1:57:14]: And I know you gotta figure out how we can make him understand that that is for somebody who has the volume or I I don't even know how to say it or position it, but that's something that we're going to have to justify, which I think we can easily with the data sets that were showing him

@Trent [1:57:37]: Well, what we can give him for free is what we've done so far.

@Chris Andrade [1:57:40]: Exactly, and this is, this is wait, man, this is what we get done for free. We have spent

@Trent [1:57:45]: Yeah.

@Chris Andrade [1:57:47]: Between all of us, there's just say 60 hours already, right? And, and there's so this is what you get for free. Now, it, but that delivery just needs to be as copacetic as possible.

@Trent [1:57:51]: Yeah. Yeah Yep, yep

@Chris Andrade [1:58:03]: And then And then obviously that will all be at the end after he experienced what we're gonna package, and that's why I want his wife there. Right? It's it's so.

@Trent [1:58:14]: Yep, yep, yep

@Chris Andrade [1:58:17]: I think we got the homework that we need to do, that's why I'm gonna spend. I, I gotta go get prepared for this drone shit. I gotta go get called up, file airspace authorization, all that stuff right now. So, I'll be working on that this evening after the gym and then I'll be back on here, I'll be back on here at 6 o'clock in the morning tomorrow or if I'm back in the office, I'll just, should I just open a Slack channel and then just keep it open and if you guys see that

@Trent [1:58:26]: Yeah

@Chris Andrade [1:58:47]: We're here, do you guys want to just play that?

@Trent [1:58:50]: Yeah, and you, like if you're there, you can also just message like, hey, listen, I'm, I'm jumping in. It, it doesn't look like it notifies when huddles start.

@Matthew Kerns [1:58:59]: Yeah.

@Chris Andrade [1:58:59]: It You have to actually go click on the huddle to see if a huddle's open or not. So, I don't know if that's a setting that can be implemented or not, but if it's not, then, yeah, that's how I found, I just saw that you guys were in it, and I just joined it.

@Trent [1:59:12]: Yeah Yeah.

@Matthew Kerns [1:59:16]: Yeah, I tried looking for that the other day, but I couldn't find the notification set up, but if I'm in slack, I can see and I'm looking for it, I can see that there's a live huddle.

@Chris Andrade [1:59:21]: OK Yeah Yeah. Yeah. So

@Matthew Kerns [1:59:31]: But maybe that's what WhatsApp can help with is just like, hey, we're we're on a huddle.

@Chris Andrade [1:59:35]: Yeah, yep

@Trent [1:59:37]: You can message inside of Slack and we'll see it, like the using the group message. Well, I, I will asterisk that I think the default settings

@Matthew Kerns [1:59:44]: Yeah

@Trent [1:59:49]: Has like a working window of like 9 to 5 or something, so you won't see notifications outside of 9 to 5, unless you change that.

@Matthew Kerns [1:59:59]: Yeah

@Chris Andrade [2:00:00]: I don't look like McHale just jumped back on.

@Trent [2:00:02]: Yeah

@Chris Andrade [2:00:03]: So, I was just saying to the guys that

@Trent [2:00:04]: They

@Chris Andrade [2:00:09]: The only concern I have for us, when we present at the end, when we ask, you know, when we're showing how much it's gonna cost is in Trey nail on the head that we've given this up to this point for free, which is what I anticipated Kelsey to receive, like we're not charging you to get to this point.

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [2:00:35]: Mhm

@Chris Andrade [2:00:35]: And how do we make that look, feel and sound is very kind of kind of could be crucial for us. But I think the way that we planned on how to execute that delivery, it's gonna

@Chris Andrade [2:00:51]: Solidify the faith with the work I put in to just ultimately hold his trust.

@Trent [2:00:57]: Yeah

@Chris Andrade [2:00:57]: And then the work that you guys put in and the combination of them both with his wife there and ultimately be seeing how much we put in. I don't see a no being an option for these guys, truly.

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [2:01:11]: So, we could do, we could do like the day before or something we could do like a proposal review or whatever, we could just like quickly walk through the whole proposal, just like the flow of like the combo, just so we're all on point and then on the same page and then just go knock it out.

@Trent [2:01:19]: Yeah

@Chris Andrade [2:01:25]: Yeah Yeah, and I think I that's that's the only concern that I really had, so I think we're gonna nail it out of the park. I'm gonna focus up and do what I think the opportunity matrix is, like we talked about, and then I gotta get ready for this drone mission and this videography stuff, so,

@Chris Andrade [2:01:45]: Yeah, if I come back, I'll, I'll open up a slack channel or see if somebody's on there and then yeah, keep you guys updated.

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [2:01:53]: E

@Trent [2:01:53]: Inside the chat here guys. I, I dropped the link and an image of where I put the files for Drao.

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [2:02:01]: Yeah, I just saw that

@Trent [2:02:02]: They're in notion, so she will just click it and go to it and download those two files.

@Chris Andrade [2:02:08]: Appreciate it, dude

@Matthew Kerns [2:02:09]: Sounds good

@Trent [2:02:10]: But So that's, that's kind of our homework and then if we have anything comes up between now and tomorrow or something, then, you know, obviously reach out, we're around.

@Matthew Kerns [2:02:12]: Yeah.

@Chris Andrade [2:02:19]: All right

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [2:02:23]: See you guys later everyone

@Matthew Kerns [2:02:23]: Sounds good, guys

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [2:02:24]: Better

@Trent [2:02:25]: All right, see you fellows
