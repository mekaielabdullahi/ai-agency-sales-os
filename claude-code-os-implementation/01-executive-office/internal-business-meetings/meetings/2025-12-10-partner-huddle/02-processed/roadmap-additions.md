## Detailed Breakdown

### Addition 1: Agency Engagement Framework Documentation

**Description:**
Fully document the 3-tier engagement model (Free Audit → Low-Cost Entry → Scale) with templates, processes, and conversion strategies for repeatable client acquisition.

**Business Value:**
- **Scalability:** Same process works for all clients
- **Predictability:** Known conversion rates and timelines
- **Delegation:** Can teach to future team members
- **Efficiency:** Don't reinvent process each time
- **Revenue Model:** Clear path from lead to $10K/month client

**Target Outcome:**
Any partner can execute the engagement model independently with documentation alone. New clients follow predictable path through the three tiers.

**Priority Rationale:**
P1 - Agency infrastructure (CLAUDE.md priority hierarchy). Critical for scaling beyond founding partners and hitting $50K/month OBG. Can't scale without repeatable process.

**Owner:**
Trent - Framework creator, responsible for documentation

**Estimated Timeline:**
- Planning: 1 week (capture Plotter Mechanix learnings)
- Implementation: 2 weeks (create templates and documentation)
- Launch: End of December 2025

**Effort Assessment:**
- **Technical complexity:** Low (documentation, not code)
- **Resource requirements:** Trent's time + team input for validation
- **Dependencies:** Must complete Plotter Mechanix audit first to capture real learnings

**Success Metrics:**
- All three tiers documented with templates
- Partners can execute independently
- First 3 clients follow the framework
- Conversion rates tracked and optimized

### Addition 2: Plotter Mechanix Case Study

**Description:**
Complete flagship case study documenting the entire process: discovery → audit → deliverables → client presentation → conversion to paid work → implementation → results.

**Business Value:**
- **Credibility:** Proof of concept for future prospects
- **Marketing Asset:** Demonstrates capability concretely
- **Sales Tool:** Shows real ROI and process
- **Learning:** Documents what works and what doesn't
- **Positioning:** Establishes agency as systematic and professional

**Target Outcome:**
Published case study showing clear before/after, ROI delivered, client testimonial, and repeatable process. Used in every sales conversation.

**Priority Rationale:**
P0 - Revenue-critical. This is the proof point that closes future deals. Without case study, every prospect is a cold start. With case study, credibility is pre-established.

**Owner:**
Matthew - Project lead (has 87% discovery done)
Chris - Client relationship and presentation

**Estimated Timeline:**
- Planning: This week (complete audit deliverables)
- Implementation: 2-4 weeks (present, convert, implement)
- Launch: End of December 2025 (case study written)

**Effort Assessment:**
- **Technical complexity:** Medium (must deliver real value to client)
- **Resource requirements:** Matthew's technical execution + Chris's client management
- **Dependencies:** Kelce must approve and engage, then implementation must succeed

**Success Metrics:**
- Kelce converts free audit to paid work
- Implementation delivers measurable ROI
- Client provides testimonial
- Case study closes future deals

### Addition 3: AI Audit Framework Templates

**Description:**
Create complete template package for Trent's 3-step AI audit framework: Stakeholder Interview templates, End-User Interview templates, Readiness Survey templates, and Output Documentation templates.

**Business Value:**
- **Consistency:** Every audit follows same high standard
- **Speed:** Templates reduce time per audit
- **Delegation:** Junior team members can execute
- **Quality:** Proven structure ensures comprehensive coverage
- **Pricing:** Known effort enables accurate quotes

**Target Outcome:**
Complete audit kit that anyone can use: interview scripts, survey forms, analysis frameworks, deliverable templates. Audit quality is consistent regardless of who executes.

**Priority Rationale:**
P1 - Agency infrastructure. Essential for scaling delivery. Can't hit 10 clients × $10K/month without delegation capability. Templates enable that.

**Owner:**
Trent - Framework creator

**Estimated Timeline:**
- Planning: 1 week (capture what worked in Plotter Mechanix)
- Implementation: 2 weeks (create all templates)
- Launch: End of December 2025

**Effort Assessment:**
- **Technical complexity:** Low (templates and documentation)
- **Resource requirements:** Trent's time to document existing mental models
- **Dependencies:** Plotter Mechanix audit must complete first to validate approach

**Success Metrics:**
- All 3 steps have complete templates
- Another partner can execute full audit using only templates
- Audit quality is consistent across executors
- Time per audit is predictable

### Addition 4: 3-Tier Pricing Model

**Description:**
Define clear pricing structure for the three engagement tiers: Free initial audit (marketing cost), Low-cost entry project ($3-5K), Larger implementation ($10K+/month).

**Business Value:**
- **Predictability:** Know revenue per client over time
- **Positioning:** Clear value ladder clients climb
- **Margin Protection:** Costs and pricing defined upfront
- **Sales Tool:** Easy to explain and justify to prospects
- **Revenue Model:** Path to $100K/month becomes mathematical

**Target Outcome:**
Documented pricing model with justification, margin calculations, and client-facing explanations. Every partner quotes consistently.

**Priority Rationale:**
P1 - Agency infrastructure. Can't scale revenue without clear pricing. Protects margins and enables confident sales conversations.

**Owner:**
Team - All partners contribute (Matthew on delivery costs, Chris on sales positioning, Trent on framework value)

**Estimated Timeline:**
- Planning: 1 week (analyze Plotter Mechanix costs)
- Implementation: 1 week (document and align)
- Launch: Mid-December 2025

**Effort Assessment:**
- **Technical complexity:** Low (spreadsheet and documentation)
- **Resource requirements:** Team discussion and alignment
- **Dependencies:** Must understand actual costs from Plotter Mechanix

**Success Metrics:**
- All partners quote consistently
- Margins protected on all engagements
- Clients convert through the tiers predictably
- Revenue per client meets $10K/month target

### Addition 5: Client Audit Deliverable Standards

**Description:**
Define standard deliverables for every client audit: Process Map format, Opportunity Matrix format, Executive Summary template, Implementation Roadmap template, Investment/ROI Analysis template.

**Business Value:**
- **Quality:** Every client gets professional, comprehensive output
- **Efficiency:** Don't reinvent deliverable format each time
- **Credibility:** Polished, consistent presentation
- **Reusability:** Templates accelerate delivery
- **Training:** New team members know what "good" looks like

**Target Outcome:**
Complete deliverable package that defines agency's standard output. Clients receive consistent, high-quality materials regardless of which partner leads engagement.

**Priority Rationale:**
P2 - Developer pipeline (in terms of building capability). Important for quality and efficiency but not blocking revenue. Can deliver without perfect templates, but better with them.

**Owner:**
Team - All partners contribute based on Plotter Mechanix outputs

**Estimated Timeline:**
- Planning: 1 week (after Plotter Mechanix deliverables complete)
- Implementation: 2 weeks (create templates from real output)
- Launch: January 2026

**Effort Assessment:**
- **Technical complexity:** Low (templates and formats)
- **Resource requirements:** Team time to review and standardize
- **Dependencies:** Must complete Plotter Mechanix deliverables first

**Success Metrics:**
- All deliverable types have templates
- Templates used on next 3 clients
- Client feedback on deliverable quality is positive
- Delivery time per audit decreases

## Strategic Alignment with OBG

**OBG:** $50K/month revenue for 3+ consecutive months

**How These Additions Support OBG:**

1. **Plotter Mechanix Case Study (P0)** - Closes future deals faster = more revenue
2. **Engagement Framework (P1)** - Repeatable sales process = predictable revenue
3. **Audit Templates (P1)** - Faster delivery = more clients = more revenue
4. **Pricing Model (P1)** - Protected margins = profitable revenue
5. **Deliverable Standards (P2)** - Quality = retention = recurring revenue

**Math to OBG:**
- 5 clients × $10K/month = $50K/month
- These additions make acquiring and serving 5 clients systematically achievable
- Without them, each client is custom/slow (doesn't scale)
- With them, client acquisition and delivery is repeatable (scales to 10+ clients)

---

## Notes

**Key Context:**
This meeting crystalized the agency's systematic approach. Previously ad-hoc, now structured and repeatable. These roadmap additions are the infrastructure that enables scaling from 0 → $50K → $100K/month.

**Critical Insight:**
Plotter Mechanix isn't just a client - it's the validation of the entire agency model. The case study is proof of concept. The learnings become the templates. The success becomes the credibility.

**Resource Allocation:**
Matthew focused on Plotter delivery + case study (P0)
Trent focused on framework documentation (P1)
Chris focused on client relationships and conversion (P0-P1)
Team collaborates on pricing model (P1)
