## Decision 1: Free Initial Audit Strategy for Plotter Mechanix

**What Was Decided:**
Provide comprehensive AI audit to Plotter Mechanix at no cost initially, showing all work completed upfront to build trust and credibility.

**Context:**
- Plotter Mechanix is strategic engagement opportunity
- Matthew has 87% discovery already complete
- Need to demonstrate value and capability before asking for payment
- This approach reduces client risk and builds trust

**Reasoning:**
- **Trust Through Transparency:** Show extensive work completed before asking for money
- **Value Before Payment:** Demonstrate ROI potential with concrete analysis
- **Case Study Development:** First client using this systematic approach
- **Repeatable Framework:** Test process that scales to future clients
- **Lower Client Risk:** No financial commitment required for initial assessment

**Implications:**
- Team invests time upfront without immediate revenue
- Sets expectation for future client engagements (free audit → paid work)
- Creates proof of concept for agency's audit framework
- Builds credibility asset for future sales
- Must deliver exceptional value to convert to paid engagement

**Owner:**
Chris Andrade - Lead client communication and presentation approach

**Timeline:**
- This week: Complete audit deliverables
- End of week: Present to Kelce
- Post-presentation: Convert to paid engagement

**Success Criteria:**
- Kelce sees clear value in comprehensive audit
- Converts free audit to paid implementation project
- Process documented for replication with future clients
- Team learns and refines framework

## Decision 2: Multi-Perspective Process Mapping Approach

**What Was Decided:**
Each partner independently creates their own process map and opportunity matrix for Plotter Mechanix, then consolidate perspectives in group review.

**Context:**
- Different partners bring different analytical perspectives
- Trent brings AI audit framework expertise
- Chris brings client communication expertise
- Matthew brings deep discovery insights (87% complete)
- Mekaiel brings business development perspective

**Reasoning:**
- **Richer Analysis:** Multiple perspectives capture blind spots
- **Cross-Validation:** Independent work validates findings
- **Skill Development:** Each partner practices systematic analysis
- **Better Output:** Consolidated view stronger than single perspective
- **Framework Testing:** Validates repeatability of approach

**Implications:**
- More upfront time investment (everyone does independent work)
- Requires coordination and consolidation session
- Creates learning opportunity for all partners
- Validates methodology for future use
- Potential conflicts between perspectives must be reconciled

**Owner:**
Team (all partners) - Individual work, then Chris leads consolidation

**Timeline:**
- Dec 10: Each partner completes independent analysis
- Dec 11: Group review and consolidation session

**Success Criteria:**
- All partners complete process maps on time
- Group review identifies common themes and unique insights
- Consolidated output stronger than individual analyses
- Framework validated for future client engagements

## Decision 3: Systematic Engagement Model (Free → Low-Cost → Scale)

**What Was Decided:**
Adopt three-tier engagement model:
1. **Free initial audit** - Build trust and credibility
2. **Low-cost entry project** - Prove value with quick wins
3. **Larger implementations** - Scale up once trust established

**Context:**
- Long-term revenue goal: 10 clients × $10K/month = $100K monthly
- Need repeatable, systematic approach to client acquisition
- Market is cautious about AI investment
- Need to reduce friction and risk for client adoption

**Reasoning:**
- **Risk Reduction:** Clients more likely to engage with no upfront cost
- **Proof of Concept:** Low-cost entry proves ROI before big investment
- **Trust Building:** Progressive engagement builds relationship over time
- **Higher Conversion:** Easier to upsell existing clients than find new ones
- **Case Studies:** Each tier creates reference material for next clients

**Implications:**
- Longer sales cycles (not immediate big projects)
- Requires patience and strategic thinking
- Must deliver exceptional value at each tier to advance
- Cash flow starts slow but scales with trust
- Portfolio of case studies builds over time

**Owner:**
Team - Strategic decision affecting all client engagements

**Timeline:**
- Immediate: Apply to Plotter Mechanix
- Q1 2026: Evaluate effectiveness and refine
- Ongoing: Use as standard agency approach

**Success Criteria:**
- Consistent conversion from free audit → paid work
- Clear case studies demonstrating value at each tier
- Predictable revenue model emerges
- Client satisfaction and retention high
- Agency reputation grows through demonstrated results

## Decision 4: Adopt Trent's 3-Step AI Audit Framework

**What Was Decided:**
Standardize on Trent's systematic AI audit framework:
1. **Stakeholder Interviews** - Business owner perspective
2. **End-User Interviews** - Frontline worker insights
3. **Readiness Survey** - AI adoption potential assessment

**Context:**
- Need repeatable process for all client audits
- Must understand existing processes before identifying AI opportunities
- Framework provides structure and consistency
- Can be delegated and taught to others

**Reasoning:**
- **Systematic Approach:** Same process for every client
- **Comprehensive:** Captures both top-down and bottom-up perspectives
- **Teachable:** Can train others to execute
- **Credible:** Professional methodology clients respect
- **Repeatable:** Scales beyond founding partners

**Implications:**
- All future audits follow this framework
- Documentation must be created for each step
- Training materials needed for delegation
- Time estimates can be standardized
- Pricing can be based on known effort

**Owner:**
Trent - Framework creator, will provide templates and training

**Timeline:**
- Immediate: Apply to Plotter Mechanix
- This month: Document framework fully
- Q1 2026: Create training materials for future hires

**Success Criteria:**
- Framework successfully applied to Plotter Mechanix
- All partners can execute framework independently
- Documentation clear enough for delegation
- Consistent, high-quality audit outputs
- Clients see clear value in systematic approach

- Matthew already has deep discovery (87% complete)
- Revenue potential: $600K-$750K business with clear inefficiencies
