# 2025-12-11 Partner Meeting - Transcript

@Trent [1:07]: What's up, babe

@Chris Andrade [2:57]: Oh, someone's in here What up, Shay

@Trent [3:05]: Hey, Chris, how are you doing? Yeah, give me a minute. I'll be right there.

@Chris Andrade [3:09]: Rovers Some water real quick

@Trent [3:31]: OK. All right, I'm here. I'm, so the DIY WhatsApp group, or DIY pod, they They were talking about using cloud and skills and stuff, and I wanted to show him my NCP set up with the sales tools and I showed him that, and now they're they're curious about how it works, so I'm

@Trent [3:53]: Currently creating a diagram that shows kind of how it works using clawed code here.

@Chris Andrade [3:59]: And this is, and this is for what?

@Trent [4:03]: For the sales tools that I have. So I have an agent that So I'm gonna I can turn on my

@Chris Andrade [4:11]: I saw that room video you posted.

@Trent [4:14]: Yeah, I mean, it, it's in our NAN it's in there, This

@Chris Andrade [4:23]: How did you build that custom CRM tool.

@Trent [4:26]: Well, I can show you. I mean, It's, I, I don't know if I'm, I don't remember how much detail I went into in the demonstration, but I can show you how I did it. I need to create a loon to show them how to do it. And my my intention actually is that I want to give everybody on the team, their own instance of NAM, that if you wanted to create your own stuff, you could, you could sort of like a sandbox, you could play with it, or it could actually be your tool set, whatever we

@Chris Andrade [4:30]: I'm

@Trent [4:59]: Create, we can actually just deploy it for you to do what you want to do, on that instance, in a way just kind of isolating the individual person and having their own, their own instances,

@Chris Andrade [5:12]: Yeah, so after I started collecting all of my recordings. And

@Trent [5:20]: Yeah

@Chris Andrade [5:21]: Documenting All of my clients that I'm pushing through our pipeline. I'm organizing that.

@Trent [5:28]: Yeah

@Chris Andrade [5:30]: After I get all that organized, and I have like a pretty good handle on Each client from there, then I'll start devoting time to it's not NAN and Really get in that environment set up. I just felt like

@Trent [5:47]: Well, I mean, I'm, I'm, I'm planning on trying to give you access to it so you don't have to worry about setting it up, you just really just have to learn how to use it.

@Chris Andrade [5:55]: Oh, yeah, I guess that that that's, I mean, that, that'll be even better, and then I could start, yeah, like sandboxing that out would be ultimately fine and

@Trent [6:06]: Yeah.

@Chris Andrade [6:07]: I eventually

@Trent [6:07]: That's my, that's my plan

@Chris Andrade [6:09]: I so I use that folder structure that I created for the construction, and I'm just pretty much just templating out.

@Trent [6:15]: Yes.

@Chris Andrade [6:19]: As I need for the this side of things. And It's just nice to already have like the fuller structure built. I just rename it. As I go

@Trent [6:30]: Yeah

@Chris Andrade [6:31]: So, hey, so I saw my post something yesterday, and I cannot find it for the life of me, but it looked like He had the whole proposal, like done up already.

@Trent [6:45]: He was working on it. I don't remember seeing a whole one. There was, there was a gamma that he created that Is like a presentation that had all the detail in it, but it need it needed to be cleaned up. All he really did was take a first pass at it. He put something in and Gamma built something

@Chris Andrade [6:57]: Yeah. OK, so I Where I could, I could not find that on the life of me.

@Trent [7:09]: Yeah, and this is, this is what Matthew was suggesting yesterday. Hey, we need to put a channel in here for plotter mechanics. and I did, so we, we can now, yeah, so now that we do communications with plotter mechanics, we should just

@Chris Andrade [7:17]: Yeah, I saw that

@Trent [7:24]: Just try to put it in that channel. Another thing that's neat that I just learned about Slack too, is if you find something that is something about plotter mechanics, in another channel, anywhere else, you can forward it, like as if you're forwarding it to a person.

@Trent [7:40]: You can forward it to a channel.

@Chris Andrade [7:43]: Oh, so like if we had a conversation in a messaging and we can forward that to the plotter channel.

@Trent [7:43]: You Yes, you can for, so if we had a conversation in the general channel, where you can take that conversation and you can forward it over to the plotter mechanics channel. It, it is still in the original location, but now we have it archived so that it's in the plotter mechanics and you can quickly find it to reference it.

@Chris Andrade [7:51]: Yeah So.

@Chris Andrade [8:10]: So I get to duplicate it by copy and pasted.

@Trent [8:12]: It's not, it, it's not duplicated, it's not duplicated.

@Chris Andrade [8:15]: No, I'm saying we don't have to by copying and pasting.

@Trent [8:17]: Oh, correct, yes Yeah, we don't, we don't need to do that. Yeah, correct. And if we needed to

@Chris Andrade [8:19]: Yeah. Yeah, that's, that's True.

@Trent [8:23]: I have access to ask Claude Code to go through all our messages and Put them where they belong, or just collect them. For us. So, I could do that too.

@Chris Andrade [8:36]: Yeah, yeah, I mean, it's it's so nice to have that capability, you know.

@Trent [8:41]: Yeah, I don't know that, yeah, I don't know that I wanna do it right now because we have a lot of topics and a lot of different places and

@Chris Andrade [8:44]: Yeah

@Trent [8:48]: Parsing that out a little time.

@Chris Andrade [8:49]: Yeah Yeah, I We, so we used to have this thing because we use Discord when we're building up our software stuff.

@Trent [8:59]: Yep, yep Yep.

@Chris Andrade [9:01]: And

@Trent [9:02]: Yeah, I'm, I'm, I'm a fan of Discord for the most part. Sometimes things don't work right, but

@Chris Andrade [9:06]: Yeah, and I like, I, this is my first iteration of Slack, and I do like it.

@Trent [9:06]: And I Yeah Mine too

@Chris Andrade [9:12]: It's, it's

@Trent [9:12]: My first one

@Chris Andrade [9:13]: Yeah, and I it's kind of similar to Discord in a sense. But it's always this, we always had the same problem is if we put something in the wrong section.

@Trent [9:25]: Yeah

@Chris Andrade [9:26]: Or talked about like, like you just said, we're on one subject, but we're talking about another subject, and we didn't switch over, yeah, the documentation got lost really easily.

@Trent [9:34]: Mhm Yeah, it can be a challenge to keep all that in order, and it would be kind of nice if there was like, I haven't looked into it yet, we talked about it. If there was a way to do tagging, so like after we have a conversation, a meeting that has many topics in it. If there was a way to just have AI just go in and say, look at all of our summary, and just apply tags to it.

@Trent [10:01]: And those tags would be like, oh, this is, this is about our branding strategy. This is about our audits and this is about plotter mechanics. They're all part of 11 meeting, but there's tags attached to it so that we can easily find them. So I don't know.

@Chris Andrade [10:10]: Right And you get, yeah, and so I, I realized, dude, yesterday I talked to 10 different People

@Chris Andrade [10:27]: In and I'm trying to keep track of all my conversations.

@Trent [10:33]: So last night when I was doing this whole ran like let's let's look at that real quick while I'm thinking about it. Sorry, I didn't complete my the the sentence. I, I do that sometimes.

@Chris Andrade [10:44]: No, yeah, yeah, it's just, it made me realize that like,

@Trent [10:45]: So

@Chris Andrade [10:49]: I have, I, I, I, so I use, I walk around with my DJ I'm like, right?

@Trent [10:49]: Yeah, Yeah

@Chris Andrade [10:55]: And it's always just on me. Well,

@Trent [10:58]: Yeah

@Chris Andrade [10:59]: I tried to use fireflies on my phone But it doesn't record the phone. And if it's on speaker.

@Trent [11:07]: What do you mean What do you mean the phone

@Chris Andrade [11:10]: Like I have fireflies installed on my phone.

@Trent [11:13]: Yeah, but like, what do you mean it doesn't record the phone.

@Chris Andrade [11:16]: Like I can't have my phone on speaker while I'm on a conversation and turn on fireflies to record that conversation.

@Trent [11:22]: Oh, you, you kind of have to have two phones to make it work. Is that what you're saying? Yeah, yeah, that, that sucks.

@Chris Andrade [11:25]: Hm. Hm So that So now I have my tablet and my other iPhone set up with it. Cause I'm so tired of having to take this. Download it Then upload it

@Chris Andrade [11:43]: It's.

@Trent [11:44]: I know. Well, so when we were talking about, you know, it would be nice if there was a little thing you could wear, and then you could use it as a way to interact with an agent or to take notes or describe what you're doing at the time or record a conversation you're having, right?

@Trent [12:01]: And I just searched real quick and Gemini, I just asked Gemini to, hey, is there anything out there like this? And it came back with some things. Some of them I was like, nah, one of them was neat, but not, I'm not interested in was that there's a pebble, the brand pebble, they used to make a phone long time ago, but they made a ring that you can wear, that has a button on it, and it's designed for you to record your conversation with somebody on the ring.

@Trent [12:31]: I was like, what? And it doesn't have a replaceable battery. The battery in it is supposed to last for 2 years. yeah, I was like, what is this thing? It's relatively new.

@Chris Andrade [12:38]: What

@Trent [12:43]: But Interesting pro proof of concept.

@Chris Andrade [12:47]: You say pebble like P E V B L E.

@Trent [12:50]: Yeah, yeah, yeah

@Chris Andrade [12:52]: There's repebble.com.

@Trent [12:52]: Yep Look, look, look for Pebble, let me look at my Gemini conversation real quick.

@Chris Andrade [12:59]: Pebble ring

@Trent [13:00]: It's sleeping patient for.

@Chris Andrade [13:02]: Oh yeah, here it is

@Trent [13:07]: Yeah, just look for like pebble ring or something, find it.

@Chris Andrade [13:09]: Yeah, yeah So have you seen those G2 glasses.

@Trent [13:17]: No, you're talking about the, the meta glasses or something else?

@Chris Andrade [13:20]: Similar, but they're being used in TED Talks.

@Trent [13:24]: Yeah.

@Chris Andrade [13:25]: And I guess TED Talks. Issues them out to the speakers So Alber wonder how they can talk, and there's like no teleprompters There's nothing like, like they're not reading. Well, apparently these glasses are what you're talking about, but there's

@Trent [13:39]: Yeah. Projector in the screens in the lens somehow to where it can see.

@Chris Andrade [13:47]: And yeah, so it's projecting your

@Trent [13:50]: But

@Chris Andrade [13:51]: What you're saying

@Trent [13:52]: Teleprompter, right? Yeah.

@Chris Andrade [13:52]: And Yeah, and but now it's actually analyzing what you're looking at too

@Trent [13:59]: Oh wow.

@Chris Andrade [13:59]: And like, yeah, it's just like ends dictating everything.

@Trent [14:04]: Oh, so are you familiar with a company Andderrill? No? They are a military defense tech company. The people, the guy that created the Oculus. OK, the Oculus video game headset.

@Chris Andrade [14:22]: Mhm

@Trent [14:24]: Like, Facebook took that over, and he was, whatever, that was a whole like disagreement thing apparently, but regardless, that guy that created the Oculus He went and started a military tech company Andderrell, and they've been creating military tech for years, but they recently announced that they're putting $2 billion into a facility just south of here.

@Trent [14:48]: Like about an hour from where I live, and The pri they have to have it operational by like the end of 2026 or something. And they just, they just broke ground like, I don't know, 6 months ago. So it's gonna be interesting. Yeah, yeah, but they said, his name is Pauly Lucky.

@Chris Andrade [14:58]: Holy shit

@Trent [15:11]: And Or is it Polly Lucky? Or Lucky Lucky Polly, man, I butcher his name all the time cause I can't, I get it criss-crossed. but, They're making a head Like they make all sorts of things, like drones and AI is at the core of what they do.

@Trent [15:31]: And They make like drones and all that kind of stuff. And one of the things I saw that they released is a a helmet. That you can wear in the field, and it has cameras on it, and it has augmented reality, so all of those projections you're talking about, like your, your teleprompter and your lenses, it analyzes the field.

@Chris Andrade [15:49]: Mhm Mhm

@Trent [15:54]: In real time, and it pops up, you know, potential threats and analyzes the things that are happening in your view, to be able to give the, the The soldier More information to act on.

@Chris Andrade [16:08]: OK, yeah, you're talking about Palmer Lucky.

@Trent [16:11]: Omer Lucky, that's it

@Chris Andrade [16:12]: Yes, OK, I know who you're talking about. So he's opening up the facility next to you.

@Trent [16:18]: Yeah, he already has facilities, but they, they are opening up a facility an hour away from here, south of here.

@Chris Andrade [16:19]: Damn I didn't know that he had his own like brand.

@Trent [16:27]: In real, yeah

@Chris Andrade [16:29]: Interesting

@Trent [16:30]: Yeah, check out Anderol. Like I mean like it, it's hardcore. I mean, that's like full on futuristic stuff. But he's doing it today, like it's, he's making it happen. So he said, like, if you watch any of the interviews with him, I love the guy is cool, but he

@Trent [16:47]: His mindset is China is catching up to us. In their technology And they're building AI All over the place, and he said for us to make sure that we can keep up with Our potential threats outside of the United States. He said that we have to put this facility in place and it has to be operational, so that we can have, have the tech and have the

@Trent [17:15]: The defense systems that we need to have to make sure that we can defend ourselves against other countries like that.

@Chris Andrade [17:21]: Yeah, looks like he had a big old TED talks about how

@Trent [17:24]: Mhm.

@Chris Andrade [17:24]: AI and World War 3.

@Trent [17:27]: Yeah, I mean, he's, I mean, he's, he's really big on this, making sure that we have the tech that we need to make sure that we are at the top. So,

@Chris Andrade [17:35]: Yeah, I'm looking Oh snap. OK, yeah, I see she has this that drone initiative and the sea drone initiative too going.

@Trent [17:46]: Yeah, and he said that they, they call it something, but they have like an AI operating system that is inside of all of their stuff, that basically runs all of their things.

@Chris Andrade [17:56]: Yeah, you know who else has that? Skydeo

@Trent [18:00]: OK

@Chris Andrade [18:01]: And they Skyio will probably be the new No, they are, they are gonna be, they are the new, like, King Dingling in the drone industry.

@Trent [18:14]: Yeah

@Chris Andrade [18:14]: Mhm, especially in industrial, like you could straight up fly their drums out in any closed quarter environment in autonomous mode.

@Trent [18:14]: Yeah

@Chris Andrade [18:25]: And it will map everything out and all you gotta do is push a button. You don't even have to fight anymore, and it will weave through like trees, gaps that you couldn't do as a pilot on the ground.

@Trent [18:39]: Yeah

@Chris Andrade [18:39]: Or unless you're really fucking good.

@Trent [18:41]: Yeah, yeah. Yeah, the, the tech's getting cool, man. So anyway, I'm gonna circle back around to what we were starting to talk about where it would be nice to have a wearable device, right? You can have it just on your person, like clip it on or something, like your DGI mic, and that's what the the plot that I sent, and then you, you replied to the plot, they have a note pen, I think is what they call it, and it's just a little pendant that you can wear on a necklace. It has a magnet and it has a little clip you so you can clip it on and it's designed specifically for these purposes where you can record

@Chris Andrade [18:45]: But yeah, it's just.

@Chris Andrade [19:14]: Yeah

@Trent [19:15]: A conversation, you can you can, you can press it.

@Chris Andrade [19:18]: So I was gonna go that route. I was gonna go that route with juice.

@Trent [19:21]: So but What I don't like about it, what I don't like about it is two things that I wish we could do with it is that Apparently you don't have to pay for the subscription. To get the audio files, but you have to do like what you've been doing with DJI where you have to record it, it records on the device, you take it, you plug it in USB and you download the files, which, which is nice that you don't have to pay for a subscription, but at the same time, I would also want the ability for it to feed into something else that can transcribe it, like a third party software, I don't necessarily want to use Plod, do it.

@Chris Andrade [19:45]: Yeah And

@Chris Andrade [20:02]: I, I would be encourage maybe we can probably, since we're just talking about it, we can look it up right now. So this is the receiver to the mic, right? So

@Trent [20:12]: OK.

@Chris Andrade [20:13]: I mess around with it a little bit when I was installing OBS.

@Trent [20:17]: Yeah

@Chris Andrade [20:18]: So I could install the receiver On my computer And then this, it turns this into my microphone into yeah into my computer.

@Trent [20:27]: A live mic Yeah

@Chris Andrade [20:31]: Right? And then

@Trent [20:31]: Yeah, yeah

@Chris Andrade [20:32]: And so like it would be like if I'm dictating through my computer, right? And so,

@Trent [20:37]: Yeah, yeah

@Chris Andrade [20:41]: I, I, I, I liked that idea, and this thing.

@Trent [20:45]: But it doesn't have, does it have a button for like starting and stopping a recording or anything?

@Chris Andrade [20:49]: Yep

@Trent [20:49]: Yeah.

@Chris Andrade [20:50]: Yep, so, I, and it this thing lasts like 12 hours.

@Trent [20:56]: Nice, yeah

@Chris Andrade [20:57]: And but the problem is, is that it's

@Trent [20:57]: Yeah

@Chris Andrade [21:02]: Bulky

@Trent [21:03]: Yeah

@Chris Andrade [21:03]: And, and so I was gonna go with the cloud or with that, that plod route, but they won't, the membership was like retarded, dude.

@Trent [21:04]: Yeah I know that's where I was, I was caught up on it too. So that's where it hung me up.

@Chris Andrade [21:15]: You know, I was like So I, I told him all I need is a bass recording feature. Right? And then

@Trent [21:23]: Yeah.

@Chris Andrade [21:24]: So that's when I just opted for this because I can use this way more than I can with that.

@Trent [21:30]: Yeah, I know that's where I was at with that too. So, another thing I wish it had, and I, I would like to have, Is the ability to have a conversation, like, for example, I want, like, I can't grab my phone cause I'm using it as my, my camera right now. But my mobile phone,

@Trent [21:47]: I can open up the clawed app or the Gemini app or Chat GBT app. But I have to pull the phone out of my pocket. I have to open it up and I have to trigger it and open it up to start my recording or start whatever I'm trying to do, but if, if I'm Kelsey,

@Chris Andrade [21:59]: Mhm

@Trent [22:04]: And I want to leverage this technology to create an SOP, which is what I did with this audio recording. If I wanted to do that, it would be best if I had the ability to just have a little wearable that I can click, and it just starts to record what I'm doing, verbally, I'll just speak out everything I'm doing, right? And then I can create an SOP very quickly that way. and then you could do other things with it too, like if you say, hey, I'm over at Steve's Printing, you know, I'm working on

@Chris Andrade [22:10]: Yeah, yeah.

@Trent [22:34]: The, the print 1000 printer, and we're doing a head change out And, you know, you can, we could do more with that too, not just create an SOP, but if you could live put that into a chat, a chatbot, like you, like you had a an app, your phone, you can take it and it could log that and send that information to

@Chris Andrade [22:51]: Right, right, right.

@Trent [22:58]: You know, a system that would process it and send it where it needs to go. So it would send it to, you know, his back office, so that it can log what he did, right? So, that's what I would like to have is something that can not just listen and record.

@Trent [23:16]: But also have the ability to trigger something on my phone. To Live, have a conversation with it trigger to do stuff, and then come back and respond to me. So that would require it to Either use the speaker on the phone, or you'd have to have like an earpiece or it has to have a little speaker on it or something.

@Chris Andrade [23:36]: And he even mentioned that he wanted to start wearing one of those action camps, and I was trying to pull up my internet's being so

@Trent [23:44]: And, and And so I was doing, having a conversation with Claude about this. I was like, OK, can I take a video stream, and would it be easy to transcribe it And pull out screenshots. So here, here's the idea. The idea that I have in my head, OK? For these SOPs, like I'm showing you right now what I created.

@Trent [24:09]: From the audio clipping.

@Chris Andrade [24:12]: Right

@Trent [24:12]: From the microphone, OK? And it's actually pretty, pretty detailed. So if we look at

@Chris Andrade [24:16]: Yeah, I saw that.

@Trent [24:18]: Yeah, so I mean, it talks like here, prepare your environment, remove as much dust as possible. Then it has like these tips use a sheet or cover, keep the rag handy, but then the The notable things, the more notable things down here was like Lift the pressure roller using the lift button, the laminate.

@Chris Andrade [24:35]: Yeah, yeah.

@Trent [24:36]: Down And it it like goes into pretty much detail based on what he was saying. Like, he's just speaking out loud, describing to his client what to do in the future.

@Chris Andrade [24:47]: Yeah You

@Trent [24:48]: So anyway What's missing from this is visuals.

@Chris Andrade [24:53]: Know.

@Trent [24:53]: No pictures

@Chris Andrade [24:55]: Well, I have video. I have, I do have the video that I'm actually just getting ready to pull up right now.

@Trent [25:01]: So what I was trying to come up with, I was like, OK, well, how do we get, you know, it to automatically put in pictures for the SOP. The way that Loom works, OK? Loom cannot do this. It can, cannot do this for physical

@Trent [25:19]: Video, but what it can do, is Let's see here. So library How-tos. So I don't know if you saw any of the step by step stuff, but it creates

@Trent [25:36]: Generate

@Chris Andrade [25:37]: I saw the flow chart that it pushed out to.

@Trent [25:40]: We'll, well, look, look here. So like on my screen, inside Loom, it has the ability to generate from the video the how-to video that I created, it has the ability to create SOP, how to guide, bug reports, PR descriptions, QA steps, code documentation, OK? And

@Chris Andrade [25:43]: You should Mhm.

@Trent [26:00]: If I go to like how to God It takes the transcription of the video, and it takes the video itself Let's give it a second here But what I want is I want this to happen, but I want it to do it with a video that he could potentially

@Trent [26:21]: Use To show what he's doing Right? And it will automatically make the, the Like see how this breaks it down. It says generating diagrams with loud. So it says step one, do this, and has a screenshot.

@Trent [26:37]: It, it puts the screenshots in for each step.

@Chris Andrade [26:40]: Oh yeah.

@Trent [26:41]: So So what I would like to have is the ability to be able to pull out images Of the video To put into an SOP That or liter you could just go the other way and just say, you know what, I don't want to put pictures in there. Let's just include the video.

@Trent [27:00]: We could, that's easier to do. But I mean

@Chris Andrade [27:05]: We're trying to we show Two things

@Trent [27:10]: Yeah

@Chris Andrade [27:11]: And these are up, not upsell opportunities, but these are opportunities that are needed. Obviously, and exactly, right? It's cause, cause, cause SNS wool sheds are gonna need the same thing. They're gonna need how it's all about documentation, the SOP, right? And, and, and

@Trent [27:17]: And in more than one space, yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah Yeah

@Chris Andrade [27:33]: I don't think I The easiest place that I ever got to onboard was with was with Apple. Why? Because they literally had every step You know, you had to get certified.

@Trent [27:49]: It carried you through it. They held your hand right all the way through it? Yeah.

@Chris Andrade [27:53]: And that's how they can push, you know, If every company had that, I think it would make the operational day to day, like monotonous stuff a whole lot easier, right? Cause in that

@Trent [28:10]: Easier. And more efficient for

@Chris Andrade [28:12]: Yeah, and, and I think again, this is one of those things that we hit home on is like, we wanna help you develop This training. These tutorials, it's gonna take, it just takes time. But then we also got to realize that it's not only time we got

@Chris Andrade [28:32]: Data storage. We got editing, we got

@Trent [28:35]: Yeah Yeah.

@Chris Andrade [28:36]: Audios, you know, Which is

@Trent [28:39]: Well Let's, let's just Yeah, sorry, I didn't want to knock you off your train of thought. You gotta watch.

@Chris Andrade [28:46]: You're gonna say it, it just It's and it's something that I've been personally tackling as far as the media stuff go cause of my own outlet, and I have access to a lot of Like video editors and stuff like that, right?

@Chris Andrade [29:03]: Same thing with Macau Is it? I keep, is it what do you pronounce it Macau or Mikaya?

@Trent [29:08]: Well Yeah. Mael

@Chris Andrade [29:12]: Me, cause I hear magic say mehael, and it like threw me off and I was like,

@Trent [29:12]: Supposedly. Yes I don't, I don't, I don't know if any of us know for sure.

@Chris Andrade [29:20]: You know, I too too, I, I just, I just.

@Trent [29:20]: Sorry Miguel if you read this, if you see this transcription.

@Chris Andrade [29:25]: I know, sorry Mika, I'm just, I, I respect your name, man. I'm just trying to make sure I get it right.

@Trent [29:32]: Exactly, that's what I told him too. I said, man, I'm bringing up, I'm gonna butcher it. I'm probably gonna butcher it more than once, and I apologize for that, but

@Chris Andrade [29:33]: Serious Yeah And I, I don't put respect on my name and I'm trying to promise, but

@Trent [29:44]: Yeah

@Chris Andrade [29:45]: It it's like that that budget, we're gonna have to eventually figure out for the client and we'll work with Kelsey on that, right? Depending on how far he wants to go cause It, it, it really, I mean, these are untouched waters, right? And I don't even know if any other agency inside the AAA offers that kind of

@Trent [30:03]: In the heart

@Chris Andrade [30:09]: Which I'd be curious to like investigate.

@Trent [30:11]: Delusion Yeah Yeah, yeah

@Chris Andrade [30:13]: And then secondly that I've been touching on as far as like the recording thing goes in when it looks like I think at the end of the day too, in our When they, when they, when it, when it's compounding or downloading the information from that day.

@Chris Andrade [30:36]: And it's analyzing

@Trent [30:38]: Mhm

@Chris Andrade [30:39]: We should teach a coach About That specific dictation from that day, and then give them coaching moments, like, hey, we noticed that you were Working

@Trent [30:53]: Or suggestions for improvement throughout the day.

@Chris Andrade [30:55]: Yeah, just like next time you were in the ditch, just say, hey, I'm entering in the ditch now, and I am uncovering this, yellow trench, like, you know, just talking it like if you were trying to teach it in order for it to get picked up, and that's kind of goes the same with us too, when you were talking earlier about like, you know, just running all the

@Trent [31:16]: Yeah

@Chris Andrade [31:25]: Slack channels and missing information, you know, in, in our deal. But if we did a good enough job to do those call out pings during our meetings, it will pick that up, right? And so it, it, it goes to again to back to us to train ourselves to have a conversation in a way that is knowing that we need to have it transcribed, so we got to use those cues in

@Trent [31:34]: Yeah Yeah, yeah

@Chris Andrade [31:55]: Our Verbiage, right? And then have that push on it.

@Trent [31:57]: The, yeah, but you. The cues help But they're not necessary to get results, because I took the Kelsey recording, and he wasn't doing, he wasn't doing any queuing, and I asked

@Chris Andrade [32:08]: Oh yeah But she was walking, but he was, but he was teaching somebody, right? And because he was a teaching somebody the AI was able to pick that up because, I mean, that's how they, that's how it like, likes to learn, right? So I, and because that

@Trent [32:15]: Yes, yes. Yeah. So, so what I'm showing, what I'm showing here is a diagram of that SOP.

@Chris Andrade [32:31]: I don't see your screen by the way.

@Trent [32:33]: Oh, you don't see it? it shows that it's sharing. Let me, I can stop sharing and try again.

@Chris Andrade [32:34]: No sir Yeah, yeah, I know.

@Trent [32:39]: Yeah. Right now.

@Chris Andrade [32:44]: There you go, if

@Trent [32:46]: OK. OK. So, I'm showing the diagram for the SOP, OK? So, because what I did is I said, OK,

@Chris Andrade [32:50]: Mhm.

@Trent [32:54]: First step, I went and downloaded the the MP3 out of your folder, and I put it into my directory here. It's right down here, right there, OK? And I asked it to do what we just talked about. I said, hey, listen, I need to transcribe this and turn it into an SOP.

@Chris Andrade [32:58]: Mhm. Mhm. Mhm

@Trent [33:13]: And I was like, how are we gonna do that? And it helped me create a what is a directive. The directive is for the agent, it's not for me, it's for the agent. So the agent follows the instructions here. And it created a

@Trent [33:30]: A Python script down here called let's see, Transcribe audio. OK, and what it did is it used Open API, so chat GPT chat GBT has a service called Whisper.

@Trent [33:47]: Which is for audio transcription.

@Chris Andrade [33:50]: Oh

@Trent [33:51]: OK. So what it did is it created a Python script that breaks the audio up into 25 megabyte pieces. Because that's the limit For whisper, and then it sends them, sends them to whisper, Whisper transcribes it and gives us back the transcript, and here's, here's the result of it, OK?

@Chris Andrade [34:03]: Interesting

@Trent [34:15]: Which looks like to me it's Really long lines, it looks like. Yeah, it's really, really wide, very wide lines, but we, and, and that's probably the multiple files like each one of them is probably a file or something, but they broke it intounks, but regardless, I didn't read through it, right? So it doesn't matter to me as long as the agent is well and I told her I want to make an SOP, but I told her I wanted it very explicitly to be an SOP for the laminator

@Chris Andrade [34:20]: Yeah Yeah, yeah, yeah. Right, right. Mhm. Mhm Right.

@Chris Andrade [34:37]: Mhm

@Trent [34:45]: For the laminator, Head up, OK? So it went through and identified inside the conversation, the transcript, where he's talking about the laminator And it picked that up for me. OK, and it created

@Chris Andrade [35:01]: No shit

@Trent [35:02]: It created the SOP, which I have, I think, right here is the SOP. This is the SOP in markdown format. OK? So, it just, it doesn't look as clean, but this is the SOP it created, and then it has like all these expert tips and warnings and you know, has all this stuff, and it's like maybe verbatim, right? Quotes, you're gonna be relying on the squareness of the initial cut to feed it in there was probably something that Kelsey said.

@Chris Andrade [35:32]: Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yep, I see that.

@Trent [35:34]: OK. So it, it, I had to ask it though, the first pass was too general. It was like step 123, like, clean your clean your area, then Feed in your material and then adjust the tension. Like it didn't, it wasn't detailed enough. So I had to make a second pass and ask it, hey, listen, I want you to don't make anything up. I want to make sure it didn't hallucinate. So I said, don't make anything up, only use the details in the transcript, but I want you to pull out all the intricate details.

@Chris Andrade [35:50]: The Yeah

@Trent [36:08]: And put them in the SOP Anyway

@Chris Andrade [36:12]: What OK go on

@Trent [36:14]: Anyway, what it did, so we went through, here's like kind of like the steps, right? Is that I got the audio, I transcribed the audio using open API. It cost 82 cents, by the way. To do.

@Chris Andrade [36:26]: Hm

@Trent [36:27]: It was 2 hours long, over 2 hours long, so it cost 82 cents to do that. Then, It spit out the transcript. It used the transcript to identify where the SOP started and ended, extracted all the details and put it into a formatted document for me.

@Trent [36:45]: OK, an organized SOP and then after that, you said, man, it'd be nice if there was a diagram or a flow chart or something, right? So, and then I asked it if it could create a diagram for me, a flow chart of Of the workflow. Now, it asked me some questions on how I wanted it to look.

@Trent [37:06]: The fir the first like option was, do you want it to just be like in a single column flow diagram, or do you want it to be in swim lanes, which is what we have here. This is swim lane,

@Chris Andrade [37:17]: OK. Gotcha. OK.

@Trent [37:20]: Preparation, machine set up, alignment and operation. OK, so breaking it up into stages.

@Chris Andrade [37:29]: So If Let's see the morning.

@Trent [37:35]: If

@Chris Andrade [37:37]: If there was a way

@Trent [37:38]: I know baby What you doing

@Chris Andrade [37:40]: This is, she has her bears. She walks out of her room every morning with her water cup.

@Trent [37:43]: Yeah Heard in the face

@Chris Andrade [37:48]: Her bear, and her baby. Every single one.

@Trent [37:48]: Yeah. Oh wow

@Chris Andrade [37:52]: Yeah, see he

@Trent [37:53]: Those are awesome. Those are super cute. Hi

@Chris Andrade [38:20]: OK. What have you guys got matching shirts today. Give me a hug You're wearing your heels, I see. Oh my gosh. So cute So cute. You don't have any shoes on.

@Chris Andrade [38:38]: I think mama's gonna help you I love you

@Trent [38:44]: So cute

@Chris Andrade [38:45]: Don't mess up with

@Trent [38:46]: Take care.

@Chris Andrade [38:47]: It, it, if

@Trent [38:47]: Yeah

@Chris Andrade [38:51]: We gotta hand this over to Kelsey in front of his wife.

@Trent [38:55]: Yeah, so

@Chris Andrade [38:55]: I

@Trent [38:57]: Yeah, if I can do this with an impromptu microphone recording.

@Chris Andrade [39:02]: Yeah, right.

@Trent [39:04]: What, what do you think we can do with Like something that was planned for this, right? Intentional.

@Chris Andrade [39:09]: Hey that's, and that's how we sell.

@Trent [39:12]: Yeah, yeah, so, so anyway, I think this is, even though this is just one piece of his business, like solving problems for him. I think that this is a big deal.

@Chris Andrade [39:23]: So legit, bro, like this, I have a laminator right there.

@Trent [39:23]: So.

@Chris Andrade [39:29]: I will get like we could put like out, you know what? I'm gonna ask Kelsey to give me his logo, actually. Where's my phone, cause it'd be nice to have his logo, like we in that presentation that we saw yesterday where they had their logo.

@Trent [39:45]: Yeah, I think that the

@Chris Andrade [39:45]: They go to their website and download it and just Jpeg that.

@Trent [39:49]: Yeah, I, I was asking, Miel to, when he does these documents because he likes creating these like documents and presentations and stuff. It, and he's good at it, yeah, he does a pretty good job of creating something clean. so I told him that we need to try to take a book out of Dennis's, or sorry, take a page out of, but to Dennis's book, and

@Chris Andrade [39:57]: Yeah He's really good at it Yeah.

@Trent [40:12]: Format it in the color scheme of the client, and their logo in there somewhere, right? So like first page or something can have their logo on it, but

@Chris Andrade [40:17]: Yep Yep Yep

@Trent [40:23]: Yeah. Yeah, that's

@Chris Andrade [40:24]: Yeah, and

@Trent [40:25]: Real nice touch

@Chris Andrade [40:27]: Very, very And

@Trent [40:29]: It's not about us, it's about them

@Chris Andrade [40:31]: Exactly We're trying to envision their, their, you know, them, yeah, so, I saw this and I was just very happy to hear that A, you remembered that. You still can't find your bird.

@Chris Andrade [40:54]: I like your reindeer shirt, it looks pretty cool. If there was a way that we can like I'm glad that you picked that up. Like I just contest to like the word team, cause I did totally forget about this, and honestly, this is a huge

@Chris Andrade [41:12]: Upsell opportunity because We're just giving this dude just a powerhouse of tools and things and

@Trent [41:19]: Cool

@Chris Andrade [41:21]: We haven't even

@Trent [41:21]: We can bring them together and make them more uniform, right? Like right now we're just demonstrating.

@Chris Andrade [41:23]: People Yeah, yeah, we only spent 3 hours with you, bro, and look at what we got. They like legit, you know. Like you, like, I think that alone is gonna contest to the value that we're bringing, like we are able to accomplish so much with so little.

@Chris Andrade [41:43]: Like That speaks vibes, like it's gonna sell itself, not a doubt in my mind. So then I started going down this rabble hole of all my other clients here.

@Trent [41:53]: Yeah

@Chris Andrade [41:54]: And, and, and Dude, there's like 4 of them. I think it would definitely run at that $10,000 a month. If we were able to somehow execute it in a way that would entice them, and I think we're doing, we're getting this our reps in right now is what they call them. We're we're wrapping them out.

@Trent [42:19]: Yeah, well, yep

@Chris Andrade [42:19]: And When we're ready to push in for our, our strong push. I think we'll be ready. I really do.

@Trent [42:26]: Yeah, yeah You, you, do you think that's a reasonable like engagement value of 10,000.

@Chris Andrade [42:28]: Want. Well, what I saw I was hesitant at first, like straight up, I was hesitant about asking 10,000, and then when we were running through just plotter mechanics yesterday alone and just seeing how much money is being lost every day.

@Chris Andrade [42:48]: Because of just the fact that they don't have the basic necessities in place. And really once we started Putting numbers on the opportunity loss section.

@Trent [43:01]: Mhm

@Chris Andrade [43:03]: I was not hesitant. Give me one second.

@Trent [43:05]: Yeah, you're fine

@Chris Andrade [43:08]: Hey, where's my hood Supposed to be See you later on you. Are you getting home?

@Chris Andrade [43:25]: Why tell me OK. And once I saw like what we were doing. And how much money he was losing.

@Chris Andrade [43:43]: And honestly, like, when you put that value Towards the ultimate goal of revenue lost in our and we the way the plan is laid out to to to not only

@Chris Andrade [43:59]: Compensate for the initial investment, but make progress to 10x that investment. 4x that investment, 2x that investment in weeks, not months. Like,

@Chris Andrade [44:16]: That's when I kind of became like Like, damn, I.

@Trent [44:20]: Ali a believer, a believer.

@Chris Andrade [44:21]: Yeah, I really do, and again, it can, if we Just keep going to like the triad of of time. Right? Communication And processes, right? Being because you don't, you're trying to get more time, but you don't have the communication or the processes, you know, it's that that

@Trent [44:42]: Make that efficient, yeah

@Chris Andrade [44:44]: And it and if you associate money to all that, not money, lost revenue

@Trent [44:54]: Yeah. But yeah, whether it's a, a loss of opportunity or a loss of revenue or or it's on the backside having to fight fires because you just had lost information, I mean, and again, emphasizing that, you know, right now they're a small company and they only have a few people involved, but if you have, you start hiring more people to help you do the work, it compounds.

@Chris Andrade [45:16]: They

@Trent [45:19]: So

@Chris Andrade [45:19]: And then I, I, I that's why I was trying to go back, like, I don't know what happened to my computer, but I saw that gamma that Macau put on.

@Trent [45:19]: So

@Chris Andrade [45:28]: And I was like He had this slide at the end where it says choose your package, right? And it said recommended 500 to 10,000, and it had the is there any way you could pull that up?

@Trent [45:42]: I'm looking forward to see if I can find it here.

@Chris Andrade [45:44]: I, I, I, I think it may have gotten erased.

@Trent [45:45]: Look at

@Chris Andrade [45:49]: Or you delete it

@Trent [45:50]: He might have deleted it. He might have, let me see if I can find it.

@Chris Andrade [45:51]: I could not

@Trent [45:55]: I

@Chris Andrade [45:56]: But that when I saw what he put in there. And it's like, you know, you had your 3 packages, which I fucking loved. And then the way that it was worded.

@Chris Andrade [46:13]: If I was Kelsey, I would have definitely, like, it gave me, 00 I, I can spend 90,000 right now.

@Trent [46:22]: Is this it

@Chris Andrade [46:23]: No. No It's not the one I saw last night, but

@Trent [46:29]: OK Let's see, I'm still looking

@Chris Andrade [46:34]: It was like in a post, and then in that post, he had like 6 different

@Trent [46:39]: Yeah, so he's got, so he's got in here in this list. I just searched gamma because I know that the link that he created, I think was in Gamma. So I don't think this is a, this is a, yeah. So this is more of a working with a rise, not, not a specific to them.

@Trent [47:03]: Let's see here

@Chris Andrade [47:05]: I'm getting really good feedback about the name too.

@Trent [47:10]: Yeah, rise, yeah. It's a, it's fitting. And then McKelly even mentioned, he's like, you know, he's like, I was thinking about the whole branding thing. He's like, it ari group can have sub-brands as well. He's like, it's a rise hero, Arise, you know, whatever you want, you know, fill in the, the different brands, so.

@Chris Andrade [47:27]: Right Yeah, no, I like it. I like it.

@Trent [47:33]: He was, he was like, yeah, it, it's like it kind of works, so across it because it's a, it's a verb.

@Chris Andrade [47:40]: Yeah

@Trent [47:41]: So, it's

@Chris Andrade [47:41]: I wonder, he must be busy this morning, huh?

@Trent [47:45]: Yeah, maybe And no one, no one else is Jumped at the hurdle or the hu hurdle, the huddle, gosh, I can't even speak lang speak normal English here.

@Chris Andrade [47:52]: Oh it Yeah right

@Trent [47:58]: All right. Let's see where he, I swear he put something in here. I don't know He, I don't think he said anything like he just put the link in, so I'm looking for a link that's just someplace.

@Chris Andrade [48:10]: Yeah

@Trent [48:13]: So

@Chris Andrade [48:13]: And it, but at, at the end of the day, When if it was just our first iteration, our first run through, and I love, that's what it was. Do you remember seeing the cartoon where it was split in half and it's like plotter mechanics.

@Trent [48:30]: Oh, the images that he put in there, yeah.

@Chris Andrade [48:30]: They Yeah, like the cartoon, I was like, oh my gosh, it describes it perfectly, dude.

@Trent [48:33]: Yeah, OK.

@Chris Andrade [48:38]: And they even have its quote in there about living in Pinetop and wine just sitting on the balcony, like servicing calls with a cup of coffee in his hand, and I it had that in there. I was like,

@Trent [48:51]: Let's see here

@Chris Andrade [48:53]: Yeah, that's it Where is that

@Trent [48:56]: So this is, yeah, we're, we're close, for sure. I don't know if this is the one you were looking at, but

@Chris Andrade [49:00]: I, I'm pretty sure it was along this this 6 Is it go to that PDF right there.

@Trent [49:07]: So he's got, yeah, you wanna go to PDF?

@Chris Andrade [49:11]: Yep, this is it Yep.

@Trent [49:13]: Yeah. So, I, I felt like it was a little busy. I liked the content. I felt like the the presentation itself is a little busy.

@Chris Andrade [49:20]: OK, yeah, and I, oh yeah, I like that first one that you said, like, wow, this is jazzy. I was like, yeah, I wanted to say like Jessie's a really good word for it, but yeah, it was that was a little, little much.

@Trent [49:34]: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

@Chris Andrade [49:35]: I, I liked, I, I, I like the overall like I mean my, my first initial impression, like the blueprint. I like, I, I did like that.

@Trent [49:44]: Mhm Yeah, are you like the, you like the blueprint and you think that, do you think that that resonates with the client? That's what

@Chris Andrade [49:55]: Probably, I mean, just because they do prints. And they do do a lot of blueprints, but yeah, as far as, I don't know.

@Trent [50:04]: Yeah We also have to fix the naming. Like I know this is the proper, this is the proper spelling, but that's not the brand, so yeah.

@Chris Andrade [50:07]: Yeah. Right. Right, right Right. And then I, I was taking notes, and that's why I was doing it mentally, and I was like, I'll just come back, and then I couldn't come back. I was like, where the hell? OK.

@Trent [50:22]: Yeah, so let's just kind of look here, right? Your time is the business's biggest bottleneck. Kelsey is the sole lead technician, single point of failure, business operations, revenue, and future are entirely dependent on your personal capacity. I do everything, your 2 hours of daily commute alone as a potential opportunity loss of 750 bucks if you were based on a 375 an hour effective rate. I don't think that, I don't think that was accurate.

@Chris Andrade [50:48]: All right. Yeah, I think, I think he even said, I think it's like $175 an hour.

@Trent [50:55]: Yeah, yeah. So we, we have to make sure that these details are on point, OK, yeah.

@Chris Andrade [50:58]: Yeah

@Trent [50:59]: Yeah. And I, and I emphasize that, but this was like a first pass. He wanted to just see, can it, can it create me something? So and he just put it in to do this,

@Chris Andrade [51:00]: So Correct And I'm just, I'm just yeah, that's where I was like just impressed with like how Fast it came back. Oh look, Matson.

@Trent [51:13]: Yeah.

@Matthew Kerns [51:16]: Hey you guys

@Trent [51:17]: Hey Matthew, what's up?

@Matthew Kerns [51:19]: What's so, what's up, yeah, I stayed up a bit late last night, so.

@Chris Andrade [51:24]: Yeah, I'm not gonna lie.

@Matthew Kerns [51:24]: Yeah Just

@Trent [51:27]: What were you doing anything fun or

@Matthew Kerns [51:30]: I did a workout with some guys, and then So that was cool. Let's hung out with some people and then After that, there was A bit of an update on one of the projects,

@Matthew Kerns [51:48]: So they realized that they want to basically create a chatbot, and so I was just kind of jamming on that a little bit.

@Trent [51:55]: Yeah, yeah, yeah, busy mind, so we all kind of have this like, like driving business that's like internal to us that we all just like an idea comes up or a problem to solve. We want to just like work on it. Can't, can't sleep.

@Chris Andrade [52:10]: Yeah, I was up in that last Way back, yeah

@Matthew Kerns [52:14]: Yeah, yeah, and he's like, he like gives an update and then I'm just like Sometimes I'm thinking like, I don't know if I should like hold back cause I'm just gonna be spewing details and stuff, but

@Chris Andrade [52:30]: The constant battle that I have with myself, like, so last night I was up till midnight, cause I have

@Matthew Kerns [52:31]: Yeah.

@Chris Andrade [52:37]: Recordings for days, like I was telling me and Trent were talking about how I process stuff in my office, and It's just leading to a shit ton of files, and then my management of files and audio, and now I have like legit yesterday I talked to 10 different potential clients yesterday.

@Chris Andrade [52:58]: And I, how can I keeping track of each conversation.

@Trent [53:03]: Well, how did you queue up 10? Were you going to an event or an organization or something like that?

@Chris Andrade [53:06]: No, so did like did this is what I mean by like I'm overwhelmed, guys. With my day to day job That's for Remus development, right? I I, I, I literally have to talk to multiple

@Chris Andrade [53:27]: Vendors

@Trent [53:28]: OK, yeah

@Chris Andrade [53:29]: Every vendor is an owner of another company.

@Trent [53:32]: Oh, yeah. It's a change, yeah.

@Chris Andrade [53:34]: You know, so. And, and so Coincidentally, 4 of those guys I've been on my radar. And they've been asking me cause I took a duration of time, like, dude, where the fuck you've been at? And I'm like, well, and then I have to kind of give them a little, little explanation.

@Trent [53:56]: Yeah

@Chris Andrade [53:56]: You're like, wait, what? And then So I had

@Trent [54:00]: And then the sports conversation

@Chris Andrade [54:02]: And then, and then then they start telling me about what they wanna do, what they're thinking, and it's good stuff, right? And so then here I am like, oh, fucking 45 minutes late, 35 minutes late, like it's really hard for me to get things done because my phone fucking rings all the time

@Trent [54:02]: Yeah. Yeah

@Chris Andrade [54:22]: And then I'm in the middle of something, and then my car

@Trent [54:24]: Sounds like you have a problem we need to solve.

@Chris Andrade [54:27]: I mean, that's why I need to set up my, I, that's why I want, I want my OBS like I literally need to wear one of these 24/7

@Trent [54:38]: Yup.

@Chris Andrade [54:38]: And like it needs to stay on all day, and then I, I would love just to, like, I need my camera set up I'm even thinking about personally buying a whole other computer, desktop, dedicating this one to my vis my video stuff, like, like where I could just upload all my videos real quick cause it sucks having to work on the computer when I'm trying to upload videos and files, and I'm trying to do work, but anyways, that's where I was going and it just

@Trent [54:56]: Yeah Yeah

@Chris Andrade [55:08]: This my office has now turned into like my little studio. And if I can record myself just in my studio and then have like that daily reporting function would be really nice because

@Trent [55:22]: Can, can the DJI Mike act as a microphone directly to the phone?

@Matthew Kerns [55:23]: Yeah.

@Chris Andrade [55:28]: Mhm, I can Bluetooth it directly to the phone.

@Trent [55:32]: OK, can you do anything other than just act as a microphone or what I'm, what I'm getting at here is that Can it feed like directly somehow, as you're doing your recordings, can it?

@Trent [55:50]: Interact with the phone while you're doing the recordings as well that's kind of like what we were talking about earlier, right? I'm just brainstorming and can DGI. This microphone potentially be a solution, even if it's not as compact as you want it to be. You already have it.

@Chris Andrade [55:58]: OK Yeah, I, I mean, I know it is. I just, I don't know how to build it or what do I need to plug and play. I said honestly it's a probably a conversation that I need to have with Claude and and again, it's just like

@Trent [56:09]: But Yeah.

@Chris Andrade [56:18]: I just have all I'm trying to do right now is just get all of this information I have, and separate it now between all of these clients that we can get, right? And that's all I'm focused on right now. And then once I have all of this data segregated or separated.

@Matthew Kerns [56:35]: Yeah

@Chris Andrade [56:38]: To where I can, we can literally have a conversation about each and every single customer opportunity or every opportunity because that's what me and Mikhael need to go through right next is Ultimately now we have all these jobs in front of us, which of those jobs can now benefit Matthew.

@Chris Andrade [56:57]: To turn jobs that can build tools that Matthew can create to get some compensation and coming in, right? I mean, I would imagine we have a shit ton of tools, generic tools that can be built in the meantime

@Chris Andrade [57:14]: And Matthew can make some sort of compensation off of it.

@Trent [57:18]: Yup

@Matthew Kerns [57:19]: Well, I think, yeah, I, I think I'm not gonna be able to make high volume of tools with that project, but what I was thinking with what you're saying, is cause there's a lot of work that goes into just preparing the prompt, preparing the golden solution and then like

@Matthew Kerns [57:38]: Working through a single bug, maybe, maybe, but like, what, what I was thinking is, with all the contacts and stuff, like, So I have in my cloud code, there's like, in the cloud code, infrastructure, there's a thing called HR

@Matthew Kerns [57:57]: There's like an HR section, and what I've put into mind is just Contacts from like networking events. I've started just keeping like a track of People and things about them, and it just, I'll just upload my notes and just, it'll process them and kind of record them in the file. So I don't know how you do your files right now. I'm sure you already have

@Chris Andrade [58:09]: Hey Well, honestly guys, like I've been, I was thinking about that last night. I

@Matthew Kerns [58:26]: Just

@Chris Andrade [58:26]: I don't know how hard it would be to drum up an environment for that. I think it would be beneficial for us, but it's, I, I have the environment set up. I just don't have the tools entered in. I don't know if there's a quick tool that I can put in here in my VS code to, to allow me to start working that problem because it is a, it's becoming a problem that is

@Matthew Kerns [58:36]: Yeah. Yeah

@Chris Andrade [58:51]: Becoming monotonous for me over here, and I'm just trying to figure out the best way to tackle it.

@Matthew Kerns [58:55]: Yeah.

@Trent [58:58]: So, so one thing that is interesting about Clawed code is that I mean, Matthew's got his back in the operating system that that helps, right? But just in general, Clawed code has the ability to go through your directories.

@Matthew Kerns [58:59]: Perfect.

@Trent [59:15]: And it has the ability to look at a directory and say, oh, here's all the files that he has in here, and it can make a suggestion on how you should get it organized.

@Chris Andrade [59:25]: What

@Trent [59:25]: It, it, I do not recommend you do this blindly, OK? You should make a backup of everything before you do anything like this, but it could move the files for you.

@Chris Andrade [59:29]: Right

@Matthew Kerns [59:34]: Yeah.

@Chris Andrade [59:36]: Anxious, that's kind of scary.

@Trent [59:36]: Put. It came in, it has the ability to do it.

@Chris Andrade [59:40]: That is kind of scary

@Trent [59:41]: Yeah, it can be a little bit scary, so do not do it on files you don't have a backup of, OK?

@Chris Andrade [59:44]: Well So this is, this, I'll give you like my My my deal here is like, I got Cause technically I have 4 businesses that I built on this computer. The media company my technology company, right? Reus Development, and now

@Trent [1:00:00]: OK

@Chris Andrade [1:00:08]: This, and I have 12, I probably got about I think like almost 10 terabytes, where's the fucking video files.

@Trent [1:00:22]: Yeah.

@Chris Andrade [1:00:22]: And pictures. And I Now because I have so much video and picture files on my computer, it's slowing down the processing, like, cause I, it's so my, the computer files are just so big, dude. It's so big.

@Chris Andrade [1:00:43]: And I don't know what to do. I've got a really legit don't know what to do.

@Matthew Kerns [1:00:49]: Well, we can, for the video files, something similar happened with my computer and I use cloud code to help me archive them, and you don't have to use cloud code for that, but I had everything in one folder, so what I did is I uploaded it, I uploaded all the massive files to Google Drive, and I don't know if that's the best solution. Like there, there might be a better solution than Google Drive, but

@Matthew Kerns [1:01:20]: You can pay for I'm sure you can pay for a 10 terabytes in a Google Drive, probably, and

@Chris Andrade [1:01:25]: Yeah, I have 5 pyramids of Google Drive, and then I bought this 23 terabyte external hard drive that just plugs in.

@Trent [1:01:33]: Yeah.

@Chris Andrade [1:01:34]: And But then I found when I need something from it, yeah, it's just been this eternal and I don't know, yeah.

@Matthew Kerns [1:01:45]: The practice

@Chris Andrade [1:01:46]: I, I think, yeah, I'll just, it's a problem that just throwing on the table and if we could collectively maybe like, oh, maybe this might be a good option for Chris. I don't know.

@Trent [1:01:46]: So Yeah

@Chris Andrade [1:01:56]: Hm

@Trent [1:01:57]: Yeah. So, what I, what I have not figured out yet, but one thing I like about Google, like just, just using Google or other cloud services that Like when you're typically storing files on like your file structure in your, your computer. It's only in one place. We've talked about this where it could be relative to other things, but you don't want to duplicate it everywhere. So having a way that it can be tagged or a way that it can be, you know, referenced by other, by other, you can have one audio file or video file that may have many topics that needs to be technically in many places, but

@Chris Andrade [1:02:27]: Oh yeah Hey guys, I'm gonna be right back real quick, OK? Keep going.

@Trent [1:02:38]: But Yeah, you're fine, you're fine. But You know, when you store these files, it would be nice and Google lets you do this. You can move it around in a folder hierarchy, but at the same time you can, you know, it doesn't matter where it is. You can find it at all times. I don't know if it has a tagging methodology, but I do like that about, about Google. So even if it's, it's got the UUID, right? So it doesn't matter where you put it, you can always create a link and the link always references back to the same file no matter where you put it. So,

@Matthew Kerns [1:03:12]: Yeah And then you can access it from multiple places, like Your phone, you could just, you could technically pull up Google Drive and search through Google Drive, or nowadays you could Hook up, clawed, to connect to your Google Drive, and then you can use the cloud app on your phone to like, use natural language and

@Matthew Kerns [1:03:35]: And pull it up that way.

@Trent [1:03:38]: Right, and I think now to, you can, as long as you have, I think, a paid plan, at least a paid plan, you can Pack, ready to go. You can

@Matthew Kerns [1:03:52]: You can Gemini

@Trent [1:03:54]: You can use Gemini, yeah, inside of it. Trying to drag a window out of arc right now, and for some reason it's just like Didn't work out like I expected it to

@Trent [1:04:10]: There, you know, like it, they put it over here, but it didn't bring it up forward. So anyway,

@Matthew Kerns [1:04:11]: So Gotcha

@Trent [1:04:17]: So There is like a, you know, ask Gemini to explore files, ask about the folder. I don't think it has the ability to move things around though. I think they've explicitly made it to where it can't modify things. It can only just tell you about it.

@Trent [1:04:35]: So if you want a Gemini to or under your files for you. I don't think it can.

@Matthew Kerns [1:04:36]: Yeah Yeah, that makes sense. I wanna protect the customer experience without like destroying all your data.

@Trent [1:04:44]: Right Destroying, yeah, that, that, yeah, they probably prioritize not deleting data over, you know, a feature that you can add, but, you know, pretty easily you can, you can go in here and connect your

@Matthew Kerns [1:04:54]: Yeah

@Trent [1:04:59]: Your stuff to Vaccinate here It's a little different on the most

@Matthew Kerns [1:05:03]: So maybe So driveear, yes, maybe they're not.

@Trent [1:05:06]: That's just the first Right? It's just a search

@Matthew Kerns [1:05:11]: Yeah, you have to, so you have to build your own API connection to be able to delete and move stuff.

@Trent [1:05:12]: However Yeah Yup, exactly. And the way that I would do it if I were to do this right now, would actually be, I would just go to cloud code

@Matthew Kerns [1:05:18]: OK

@Trent [1:05:25]: And I would let cloud code handle it, probably in my automations here, my agentic workflows. I would let it build a script that uses the Google API, which I already have one of those that it created for me, someplace here.

@Matthew Kerns [1:05:39]: Yeah

@Trent [1:05:41]: So like update sheets

@Matthew Kerns [1:05:41]: I have one too

@Trent [1:05:42]: Update sheets is a Google Sheet, API and then

@Matthew Kerns [1:05:47]: OK

@Trent [1:05:48]: Generate proposals actually slides, Google slides.

@Matthew Kerns [1:05:49]: Yeah, I have a OK, nice

@Trent [1:05:53]: So, So anyway

@Matthew Kerns [1:05:55]: Mine is, I, I have a drive integration one where I can move around the drives, folders and files cause I wanted to do that,

@Trent [1:05:56]: But

@Matthew Kerns [1:06:06]: It's like a screenshot archive cause I would always screen record and then upload, like now it's all in in drive and then I actually deleted it from my computer to free up space, so.

@Trent [1:06:10]: Yeah Yeah, yeah, yeah. So, but it, it would probably still be faster, like if for the processing and you don't have the delays of the API. To do local file.

@Trent [1:06:28]: Modification or organization, cause I mean, it can like, Claude Coke can execute bash commands in the terminal and just go find all the files. That's how it does what we're doing with Claude Oss and whatnot, right? So it's just much more fast, it's much faster and more efficient to just do it local if you can.

@Matthew Kerns [1:06:42]: Yeah

@Trent [1:06:50]: So

@Matthew Kerns [1:06:50]: Yeah.

@Trent [1:06:52]: My recommendation for

@Matthew Kerns [1:06:52]: So beginning to

@Trent [1:06:54]: Good.

@Matthew Kerns [1:06:54]: Yeah, yeah, go ahead

@Trent [1:06:56]: I was just gonna say my recommendation probably to yeah, we got a delay here, but my to Chris would really to be to take that

@Matthew Kerns [1:06:56]: No, you're good

@Trent [1:07:04]: To to take that drive that he has, if he can put everything in one place somehow, and then replicate it. Just a backup, create a, a total backup of it, and then you could use cloud code and point it to the directory and explain to it what you're trying to do and have it also pro like have probing questions to make sure that you organize it properly, to make the plan, right? And then have it organize the files for you on the new drive, the, the, the one that you intend on working on it, to, to try to get things in order for you, and then it can give you best practice

@Trent [1:07:42]: S to follow in the future.

@Chris Andrade [1:07:45]: So I do, I, I make like a Dummy folder with a backup, and then And then pretty much run my test quad folder environment in there.

@Trent [1:07:59]: Yeah, I would, my suggestion would be to have a total separate piece of hardware that you can copy it off to. Like another drive of some sort or another computer that you copy whatever files, you you should trial this on a smaller scale, OK? So, you might have 20 terabytes of information, but don't try to do that the first time through, right? So we work with a smaller piece, make sure you're just cherry picking something that you're like, this is garbage, my organization sucks here. Bring it over, make a copy of it, and then have it

@Chris Andrade [1:08:08]: Mhm. Yeah, yeah Right

@Chris Andrade [1:08:32]: Yeah

@Trent [1:08:36]: Clawed. Work on that for you, and just experiment with it, just ask it to help you organize your files.

@Chris Andrade [1:08:40]: Interesting Yeah, I, I'm gonna have to Figure that out

@Trent [1:08:46]: We can Yeah, we can help point you in the right direction for that, but that is

@Chris Andrade [1:08:49]: So I, and I use Lightroom Classic.

@Trent [1:08:53]: OK

@Chris Andrade [1:08:53]: For all for all my like or like organizing all my photos and stuff like that and

@Trent [1:08:58]: OK

@Chris Andrade [1:08:59]: Yeah, I, I love how I, I'm trying, I'll try to mimic the way it does that too, because I love their folder structure and how they organize it naturally, fucking adobe. You know. He really

@Matthew Kerns [1:09:14]: So, but you're

@Chris Andrade [1:09:16]: Go, go ahead

@Matthew Kerns [1:09:16]: I was gonna say like, you're big, your problem is that your phone is ringing off the hook and interrupts you all the time. And

@Chris Andrade [1:09:23]: Well, so

@Matthew Kerns [1:09:24]: So

@Chris Andrade [1:09:25]: Tuesday

@Matthew Kerns [1:09:25]: But that's actually a good thing because you need to be in contact with these people. So,

@Chris Andrade [1:09:30]: You're 100% it's just my what I'm having a hard time is because let's say for instance, Brandon Heck with Nordic, right? Nathan with Guardian, right? Burt Beavers with Gonzalez yesterday.

@Chris Andrade [1:09:47]: All these three guys Are talking towards the same project that I have in mind, right? And so and then I, that's why I like the recordings cause then I can group those recording calls into that category. That's how, that's how my, that's how I started working out yesterday cause that's what happened. It's like, fuck, I needed to get what Brandon said, what Bert said, what Naked said, what Mike is gonna say, and then put that into

@Matthew Kerns [1:09:56]: Yeah

@Trent [1:10:07]: Yeah

@Matthew Kerns [1:10:15]: Yeah Yeah

@Chris Andrade [1:10:20]: My project for my, what I'm, you know, that Project

@Trent [1:10:26]: Yeah.

@Chris Andrade [1:10:26]: All those conversations with that project, you know what I'm saying?

@Trent [1:10:28]: And

@Matthew Kerns [1:10:30]: So that's the automation that we would, we could build for you is like, OK, you have, you have a conversation, you get it recorded somehow. You're already, you're already doing that. And then we just set up an NAN automation that processes the recording, whether it's audio or video, and extracts the transcript and just processes it through some sort of process that we define and puts it

@Matthew Kerns [1:11:00]: Into your project files.

@Trent [1:11:02]: Yeah, so, so you, you missed the first period of time that Chris and I started this conversation, and What we really hit on in the beginning was that I, I took that audio recording from Kelsey, and you may have seen some posts I had in Slack that I took the audio recording and it's like

@Trent [1:11:24]: It's intention is not there at all. There's no real intention for the first half of the recording. It's just listening to Kelsey supporting his client. And what I was able to do is I was able to put that in my, can you see my screen, Matthew?

@Matthew Kerns [1:11:41]: Yeah, yeah

@Chris Andrade [1:11:41]: Yeah, me and my

@Trent [1:11:43]: So, I, I put the MP3 in here. OK, I downloaded it, and what I asked Claude to help me with was I need to transcribe it, which we may have already transcribed it somewhere else, but I, I wanted to basically work through this process.

@Chris Andrade [1:12:00]: Right, right, right

@Trent [1:12:01]: And I asked that, hey, look, this MP3, I need to transcribe it, and then I need to turn the transcription into an SOP and I told it that listen, there are many topics of conversation in this, in this audio file. I need to extract only the laminator set up as an SOP. Now, the audio transcription

@Trent [1:12:23]: It's not like it was a clear delineation. At some point We're starting this, right? It picked it up and this is And what it created Well, I use, sorry, back up, the process was it created a Python script. The Python script breaks the files into pieces that are within the open API limit.

@Trent [1:12:49]: So open AP or or not open open API Open AI Open AI limit to use Whisper. So what it did is it took the chunks and passed it up to Whisper and transcribed the audio to create the transcription. Right?

@Matthew Kerns [1:13:02]: OK. So is that's whisper in the cloud?

@Trent [1:13:03]: OK Whispers in the cloud, yes. Now, there might be ways to do this without using cloud, but I used, it was the way that lauded code directed me to do it. I didn't tell it specifically what to do. It came up with a plan. it used FFMEG or something to process the file and break it into pieces or something, and then it took the pieces and sent it up to Whisper to transcribe it. it took a little while to do, but it didn't, and it came

@Matthew Kerns [1:13:18]: Yeah OK. OK Cool.

@Trent [1:13:36]: Back with a transcript, which is right here. The transcript, I think these are really wide, really wide lines, and I think they might be the different chunks that it broke it into. Each one's a chunk.

@Matthew Kerns [1:13:45]: Mhm

@Trent [1:13:50]: And

@Matthew Kerns [1:13:50]: Yeah Probably

@Trent [1:13:52]: But what it created, OK, was, I don't know if you saw it, but what it created I can see where I have it. I have it here someplace. In here, yeah. So what it created was something like this, when I asked it, the first pass, it was too generic and just said like, oh, set it up, you know, like plug it in, wipe it off, put the material in, and then

@Trent [1:14:17]: Operate it, OK? It was too generic, so I asked it to bring in, I said, don't make up anything. I said, don't make up any details, but I want you to pull out all the intricate details of what's happening in the audio file, and we need to put them in the SOP and it did exactly that. It went through and it created, it says, like, if you set all of these up to 70, you'll be in the right ballpark. I mean, that's, you know, like verbatim tips from Kelsey, and what I was really hitting on was not only did I get this, but I also had the ability to create

@Matthew Kerns [1:14:32]: OK

@Chris Andrade [1:14:39]: Mhm Mhm, mhm, mhm.

@Trent [1:14:53]: The diagram for it, the process flow here, OK? OK.

@Matthew Kerns [1:15:00]: Nice. Yeah, this is a great idea and implementation.

@Trent [1:15:03]: So Yeah, exactly. And, and so this is the, it asked me questions on how I wanted the format to look, OK? But I eventually landed on one of the the option two that it gave me, which is swim lanes. So by phase one is preparation machine setup, alignment, and phase 4. You can also see down here it's doing like troubleshooting steps.

@Trent [1:15:27]: And it talks about equipment needed and is the tracking crooked, you know, check the clutches to set the same position. So really what I want to highlight here is that the audio file had no intention of creating this.

@Chris Andrade [1:15:34]: OK

@Trent [1:15:43]: If we can do it with a a A totally Not even planned audio file. What can we do with something that has intention behind it to create this.

@Matthew Kerns [1:15:51]: Yeah.

@Trent [1:15:56]: So we were like, how can we give access because what you're talking about and what Chris is talking about, how can we set it up so it's really easy to record audio

@Matthew Kerns [1:15:56]: Yeah

@Trent [1:16:07]: To do these SOPs, and then I was proposing, how do we take it to the next level where it's sort of like an assistant that kind of lives on you, and you can, you can relay a message into a system that it goes back to the back office to relay a message to Alyssa, or it logs your activity and marks, you know, some of your inventory taken care of, right? so, but you need a live connection. It needs to be a live connection

@Matthew Kerns [1:16:16]: Yeah.

@Matthew Kerns [1:16:34]: Yeah

@Trent [1:16:37]: That way. So I was trying to figure out a device that can talk to a phone that can talk to Claude that can talk to a backend system, so anyway, lots of words.

@Matthew Kerns [1:16:37]: And Yeah, cool And then, and then like, it can also, like with this process that you've just created,

@Matthew Kerns [1:16:56]: It can basically create an SOP library Right?

@Trent [1:17:02]: Yeah, yeah, yeah

@Matthew Kerns [1:17:02]: Like And it can check if that SOP already exists, and if not, just create a new one, just from people's audio.

@Trent [1:17:08]: Mhm. Yeah, yes, yes. And then

@Chris Andrade [1:17:14]: Uses what we're talking about real quick and this like, again, dictate that in our notes, like this is we're what we're discussing is something that we need to deliver to Kelsey as a solution, opportunity for SOP.

@Trent [1:17:27]: Yes, I

@Matthew Kerns [1:17:27]: This is, yeah, and this is like Literally like, we're thinking that the training and the SOP creation is going to take a long time, but it might take way shorter with all this.

@Trent [1:17:39]: It's, I think it's putting it into a a user-friendly form.

@Chris Andrade [1:17:42]: The only time it's gonna take is to actually go, the person, the audio, the video, to set it up, to collect it, and and upload it, right? Cause we're not gonna be able to let these guys, we're gonna have to show, I'm gonna have to show these guys how to do it.

@Trent [1:17:57]: Well, they, so what we would do is we would, they're not gonna do it the way I did it. What we would do is transform what I have into a process or an automation, that all they have to do is record the audio.

@Chris Andrade [1:18:11]: Well, that's what I mean, like there would have to be that to make sure they're recording it, uploading it, like that training, right? You probably have to innovate maybe a couple times.

@Trent [1:18:18]: Yeah. But ideally we would try to make that as frictionless as possible to make it really easy for them to be able to do this recording and upload it somewhere to like Google Drive. If they can just literally use an Android phone or an iPhone to just record the audio and then dump it in Google Drive. It can be as simple as that to trigger an automation to do what we, what I'm showing right now. or even more ideally, we have a way that we can literally

@Chris Andrade [1:18:24]: If possible

@Matthew Kerns [1:18:47]: Yeah

@Trent [1:18:50]: Just have it He just like presses a button or he

@Chris Andrade [1:18:54]: That's great That in that like cause he already does it and I don't know how hard or how hard it would be to, again, this would be really cool, you were building our own dashboard that could be on the phone, but like, if he can open our dashboard through his phone to connect to that agent to go to the main hub, and all he has to do is push the record button on our app.

@Trent [1:19:07]: Yup Yeah

@Chris Andrade [1:19:20]: That I like to do that. And then now we just became the provider for that channel to connect his systems. Again,

@Trent [1:19:22]: Yeah

@Matthew Kerns [1:19:30]: Yeah

@Trent [1:19:31]: And

@Matthew Kerns [1:19:32]: Yes

@Trent [1:19:32]: Also, also, these are all solutions, these are all things that we can work towards building, but also think about if we are able to take the audio, turn it into an SOP that's referenceable by Not just training his internal personnel. But why can't this also be a value add for his client.

@Trent [1:19:53]: His customer After he makes a service call, he can record the audio and have it produce this document that he sends or it automatically goes to the client's email that they can see what they did for that.

@Chris Andrade [1:20:09]: Please take it a step further. Now you're building a portfolio on his clients, and then we know that his client A has printer XYZ that needs these set up. Oh, you need these set of SOPs for associated on that printer that is in our repository that gets plugged into his user, and now, you know what I'm saying?

@Trent [1:20:24]: Mhm. Yup. And repository, OK. So not only are we creating one document

@Chris Andrade [1:20:39]: Most

@Trent [1:20:39]: But we're creating all these documents that are going to go in a repository that now with the knowledge base,

@Chris Andrade [1:20:43]: Mhm. Mhm

@Trent [1:20:46]: Now with the knowledge base that he could create and we could create an agent or a bot that he could have a conversation with to extract the details he needs to out of the repository, or his client.

@Chris Andrade [1:20:54]: Mhm.

@Trent [1:20:59]: Can go on to a support website and just chat with the bot to get the answers that Kelsey would normally give them.

@Chris Andrade [1:21:06]: Or send a picture, hey, this is happening, or the video a real quick 75 2nd video. Hey, the, the printers, they're like, it's making this sound.

@Trent [1:21:17]: Well, at first

@Chris Andrade [1:21:17]: And he identify that.

@Trent [1:21:19]: Yeah, and at first the, the his end user, his client could just take a video and send it to him somehow. And, and Kelsey could look at it and then send them the appropriate SOP or something, but we could actually automate that in the future. We could actually set it where if they take a picture or they take a video or they send a text as a request. It could go and look at the knowledge base, pull out the details it needs, and send it to them automatically without Kelsey even being in the loop.

@Chris Andrade [1:21:48]: So this is reflecting on the like, so now we're talking, so I have this philosophy I from a guy I met in college. It's called the spear theory. It looks like Mikhael is on the phone too. What up, dude?

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [1:22:02]: Morning guys. I'm just soaking up the games are like, but I love it. I love it trend that that makes so much sense.

@Chris Andrade [1:22:09]: Yeah, right

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [1:22:09]: Yeah

@Trent [1:22:09]: Yeah, yeah, I mean,

@Chris Andrade [1:22:10]: Hey I know it

@Trent [1:22:12]: Wild

@Chris Andrade [1:22:13]: If we're solving a lot of problems here and, and where I was going with the fear theory is that It's about, you know, as you walk this path of this life, you know, you, you choose a path and sometimes you got to go right or left or straight, and sometimes old pass line up on new paths, right? That seemed kind of

@Chris Andrade [1:22:36]: Conceptual thing can be rolled out for plotter mechanics and on our sales script, right? Because We are on this journey with plotter mechanics. This journey has multiple paths to navigate. Multiple directions that he can go. Ultimately, it's his decision on he wants to go right, left, or straight. But each path has its own predetermined destination, right? Because this path right here

@Chris Andrade [1:23:08]: Will connect him to other paths, right? But it's like if we overwhelm them with all of these paths, right? It's gonna be overwhelming to him and his wife. But if we can just convey the ultimate

@Chris Andrade [1:23:25]: What did you call your things like the golden

@Matthew Kerns [1:23:29]: Golden's solution, like the vision, the ultimate vision basically.

@Chris Andrade [1:23:33]: OK, if we can just give him the path with the golden vision at the end of it, right?

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [1:23:39]: Yeah. Chris, I get you. I think, sorry to interrupt. I

@Chris Andrade [1:23:43]: No.

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [1:23:44]: I think, I think what needs to happen is like 10,000 ft view like presentation and then something like this to get into the weed to show me exactly what that would look like, and then offering phase out solutions. So we can packages up in a nice way because we have the details now. It's just about presenting it in a way and offering it in a way where it's digestible, right?

@Chris Andrade [1:23:52]: Right Which by the way, I want to speak to cause what you did last night or what you said showed us a little gibbet on gamma, like, dude, that looks so good, like, like I was like, holy shit, yeah, yeah,

@Matthew Kerns [1:24:04]: You guys, I wonder

@Chris Andrade [1:24:22]: Like I was overall, I was, I was impressed on just if this was the first pass. And then what really hit me hard was when you had the selection of the 3 different packages he can buy.

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [1:24:39]: Yeah, I like, I liked how I did that,

@Chris Andrade [1:24:42]: Yeah, I, I do, but.

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [1:24:43]: It's phased out, like you can, you can, you can choose like the whole, like, you can do the whole like 12 months. You could do the first phase, you could start wherever, and I think we're adding a lot of value with before even like signing the.

@Chris Andrade [1:24:48]: Right 111 right there.

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [1:24:55]: I don't even think

@Chris Andrade [1:24:57]: 12

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [1:24:57]: You know

@Chris Andrade [1:24:59]: Like That for me, that hit home. You know

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [1:25:08]: Yeah

@Chris Andrade [1:25:09]: It gives you multiple options to make them feel comfortable on you know, yeah, you, you wanna test this out? That's fine. That's cool. Yeah, you know, there's this package, the tester.

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [1:25:09]: Yeah Or you want to do Me.

@Chris Andrade [1:25:21]: Ultimately, if you really want us to jump right in and build out a system real quick. Yeah, or if you want a full commitment, like dude, this fucking genius, dude.

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [1:25:34]: Yeah, I just think overall I think it's just smart to try to engage with people on a longer term because it's like all of the things we're talking about are great, but it's gonna take time. I, I don't

@Trent [1:25:44]: Yeah, and he, they need to understand that the expectation, right? They, we have to set the expectation appropriately, that listen, you know, we can give you some small wins in a short time frame, meaning in weeks or a month, right? But, but to really do this, we need a long-term engagement over like a year probably. So,

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [1:25:45]: You know

@Chris Andrade [1:26:05]: And, and, and that's where the

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [1:26:07]: That's with, with, with milestones and expectations, and those, those would be laid out like as we saw, you know.

@Trent [1:26:12]: Yes.

@Chris Andrade [1:26:13]: It did a good job doing that too.

@Trent [1:26:16]: Yeah, we would have

@Chris Andrade [1:26:16]: And the fucking cartoons. So

@Trent [1:26:19]: Yeah, yeah

@Matthew Kerns [1:26:21]: I was gonna say the image, and yeah, the, the cartoons and like the comparison and stuff, but that also that AI image got me thinking, like, if we can't, you know, the golden vision idea like, we can literally use something like VO 3, and create some sort of little video that just

@Chris Andrade [1:26:35]: Mhm.

@Matthew Kerns [1:26:44]: Literally shows the vision with all the details that we have. We just feed it to like, we can just try it and see what comes out.

@Trent [1:26:47]: Yeah

@Chris Andrade [1:26:52]: Wow factor.

@Trent [1:26:53]: Oh my gosh, that or nano banana, you could just use nano banana in here.

@Chris Andrade [1:26:58]: Is that the new one that

@Trent [1:26:59]: I mean just for images, isn't it?

@Matthew Kerns [1:27:01]: Yeah, yeah. I, I also have Sora too access, which

@Chris Andrade [1:27:04]: Can you go to

@Matthew Kerns [1:27:06]: You can, we can use and like basically what I'm thinking is like, OK, just imagine like, it's like a cartoon of Kelsey.

@Trent [1:27:13]: That's like next level.

@Matthew Kerns [1:27:15]: And then, yeah, and then he's got his little like microphone recording and maybe there's an imaginary AI bot that just goes and does things and records the SOPs and then just delivers stuff and like does all these things.

@Trent [1:27:29]: Hey Chris, do you have

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [1:27:29]: That'd be pretty cool

@Trent [1:27:32]: Do you have a good picture of Kelsey?

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [1:27:32]: I know

@Chris Andrade [1:27:34]: Yeah, here, let me show you my screen.

@Trent [1:27:35]: OK, because we could take that literally and create not only put him in these cartoons inside the presentation, but we could actually turn that into a video too, like what Matthew is saying. I mean, I know that these probably aren't necessary for things, but these are things that we can show him that he would just, his jaw would be on the floor.

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [1:27:38]: Shoot it go Yeah That's so

@Chris Andrade [1:27:58]: Do you, did you guys remember hearing the section of when I showed him what Gemini did with that projection of what the Market analysis were?

@Trent [1:28:10]: Uh-huh

@Chris Andrade [1:28:10]: Or just, so I did a little market analysis before the meeting. Right? Bran that through Gemini and then did an audio transcript, like a podcast.

@Trent [1:28:16]: Mhm Mhm Turned it into a podcast, yeah

@Chris Andrade [1:28:25]: I just played like 45 seconds, bro, he did, his face did what you just did. It literally hit the ground, yeah, and it was just Because it was a podcast version of this fucking report, and he loved that. So if we're, if you're telling me what you what you just said and him and his wife see that and like these motherfuckers did this in fucking less than a week.

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [1:28:49]: Yeah, Matthew, you're thinking like an animation, right? Like a little video or like a story, yeah. That'll be great, like, just be like, hey, check this out, at the end and just like.

@Trent [1:28:52]: Yeah

@Matthew Kerns [1:28:53]: Yeah, and we can hit all the

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [1:28:58]: Boom. I, I think that would be pretty cool.

@Trent [1:28:59]: I mean, OK, so that doesn't does that add a lot of value to, like, as an application for his business, not really. I don't, I don't see an application right now for that. However, well, I mean, actually,

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [1:29:03]: No, no

@Chris Andrade [1:29:07]: But The wow factor, bro, wow factor.

@Trent [1:29:14]: But the, but the wow factor, right? It's like it's that little extra, you know, I don't want to say Einstein on the cake, but I would say like the firework, the firework that's in the cake, really, to be honest.

@Matthew Kerns [1:29:19]: And it can

@Chris Andrade [1:29:21]: Damn it.

@Matthew Kerns [1:29:27]: Yeah, and like all those things, all the stakeholders in the room too can be part of it, and it's like, OK, the vision for their dream life, if we just portray that in a video, but compared to like what they're doing now, like we don't have to create the video. I don't know, we could have like what their life might be like now with all the stress and worry and stuff, and, the vis

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [1:29:28]: OK Yeah, yeah

@Chris Andrade [1:29:48]: Well Tray, can you go back to the beginning of this where the section of, of, it was in this grouping of where these files were. In the post Cause you have one image, yeah, that one, like that shit right there, bro, like that shit right there when my, when I saw this, I was like, dude, this is

@Trent [1:30:04]: Yeah

@Chris Andrade [1:30:10]: Kelsey. Like, you throw red hair and a beard undoed? That's Chelsea.

@Trent [1:30:10]: Yeah

@Matthew Kerns [1:30:17]: We can, if we could take his likeness.

@Chris Andrade [1:30:21]: I'm trying to find I thought I had one, but the image was not kept.

@Trent [1:30:21]: And If we could take his likeness and feed it in to create this. This vision, that's what this slide is, right? Is the vision of where you are and where you want to be and just put freaking Kelsey in here. It's pretty freaking awesome.

@Matthew Kerns [1:30:35]: Yeah.

@Chris Andrade [1:30:40]: Yeah, I, I'm

@Trent [1:30:40]: So this is this is notebook LM.

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [1:30:44]: Yeah, no buckala. and, I also wanna, what I want to do is with your drop the, can you like share the draw IO file that you just went over and I almost want to run. That through, back through like myOS and just see if there's any gaps or anything on the plan and then just create like another presentation. Yeah, like that, that exact framework.

@Trent [1:31:05]: So I took what we had, not the newest version. I took what was already in our, like what Matthew had pasted into our chats because I wanted to see what it would do. I want to see what it would do. And it created two different versions of an Ops canvas. OK, I got two different versions. This one here is what we were trying to build, manually or however we see fit to match what the accelerator or Liam's team says to do, which is the acquisition engine delivery engine.

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [1:31:13]: OK OK. Yeah.

@Trent [1:31:35]: And the support engine flows, it built, but then it also created one that was

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [1:31:39]: Yeah.

@Trent [1:31:44]: It was grouped Differently It was grouped and actually I think it looks a little cleaner too. I'm not sure why it chose to go a different route here. On the visuals, but it, it actually represented what was in the, the markdown file, the text,

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [1:32:03]: Yeah Yep

@Trent [1:32:05]: It grouped it like daily workflow. Here's Kelsey as the bottleneck, the communication flow, the the chaos, the system's data fragmentation showing that they had their broken on their systems, and the vicious cycle, why you're stuck, you can't scale because of this, because of this, because of this, you know, and then the cycle continues, and then it shows down here the revenue impact summary. So it, it created this one without me giving it direction.

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [1:32:09]: Oh

@Trent [1:32:31]: OK

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [1:32:31]: Mhm.

@Trent [1:32:32]: But the other one I, I said, can you just keep the format the way that it is using the groupings of acquisition engine delivery engine, and support engine. I can give you all these files, no problem. You can choose whatever it is you want.

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [1:32:44]: Yeah, please

@Trent [1:32:47]: And see what you can do with it

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [1:32:48]: OK. Cause I feel like that would tie it together better, but what you have to think about, like, we should probably set some time to like, go over the presentation with Kelly, just like how, like, we have a lot of different mediums that we want to use just tying that together and then just

@Trent [1:32:50]: But Yeah Yeah.

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [1:33:04]: Like tie in that offer, I feel like, I feel like we're there.

@Trent [1:33:06]: Yes We need, we need to definitely Like we have tons of stuff that we can show. We need to verify it makes sense, like the details need to make sense. and we need to tie it all together into like one

@Trent [1:33:23]: One presentation flow. It doesn't have to be one presentation article of, like, doesn't have to be one slide deck or whatever, but it does need to have a flow to it.

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [1:33:33]: Yeah. Yeah, I think we can start putting, when do you guys think we're, we're there to start. I think we could like

@Trent [1:33:35]: Yeah

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [1:33:41]: Go through some details. I need to go through some details a little bit, and then we can start tying that together. I think I feel like we're already.

@Trent [1:33:41]: Well

@Chris Andrade [1:33:47]: Like what I got last night, what you put together, like I felt like shit dude, all we gotta do is just verify that the, the data is like somewhat accurate or relatively close like. Think The question I said it was 375.

@Trent [1:34:06]: Yeah, and that was, that was something that we just think of.

@Chris Andrade [1:34:08]: I commute like $750. You

@Trent [1:34:11]: Yeah.

@Chris Andrade [1:34:13]: Just go through all I think, I think this is like

@Trent [1:34:14]: We're losing

@Chris Andrade [1:34:19]: Right there and if we just can just finish up just the Like Just very Of mistakes That it made in

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [1:34:31]: Yeah.

@Chris Andrade [1:34:33]: I think we're, I think we're there. And then now, oh am I and Tra early this morning when you guys, that with what Trent captured cause it's, I freaking shame on me, forgot about the opportunity for the SOP side.

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [1:34:33]: Yeah

@Chris Andrade [1:34:49]: Well luckily Trent caught on to that, and that's when he went to work and then provided that, and then honestly now realizing what after seeing it, like that's gonna sell itself, and that's where where I met by like the path, the spear theory, because there's so many paths that he can choose to make money. How do we make, how do we hold his hand to which one, you know?

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [1:35:07]: Yeah

@Trent [1:35:13]: Yeah. So did Mikel, did you, hear, I know you kind of jumped in and then maybe jumped out or something, but did you hear about how I took the audio from Kelsey's Mike and I turned it into an SOP.

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [1:35:29]: No.

@Trent [1:35:30]: Yeah

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [1:35:30]: I was that, but that's, that's, that's why.

@Trent [1:35:32]: Yeah Dude, so

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [1:35:35]: And how'd you do that

@Trent [1:35:36]: Good.

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [1:35:38]: How, how'd you do that

@Trent [1:35:39]: Yeah, so I'll walk you through it just real quick cause it's actually in the transcript. You could summarize it real quick, but I'll show you what I did. I took I took the audio from the Google Drive that Chris had, OK. That audio is, if you, I don't know if you can see my screen or not, but there is an MP3 file that I put into my cloud.

@Trent [1:36:01]: Project here

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [1:36:01]: I can see it.

@Trent [1:36:02]: OK? And I told it what I needed to do. I said, Listen, I have an audio file. It's not organized. It has random conversation and topics and a bunch of other stuff that's mixed in there, but I want to take the laminator The laminator set up, because I was listening to the audio, OK? And I picked up the Kelsey was describing to his client, verbally, how to set up his laminator.

@Trent [1:36:28]: OK? And this wasn't planned at all. Anyway, he, he, he described, and he also provided details and tips, like ad hoc, the way that he speaks, in the microphone, in the recording, so I asked Claude to create me a directive and a Python script. I didn't tell it to do that, but I said, hey, I need a way to transcribe and extract the laminator setup and turn it

@Trent [1:36:58]: Into an SOP So I created it like it, it created an SOP that is just awesome. And if we can do creating the SOP plus the workflow diagram, which I'm actually showing on my screen right now, that's, I had it do the SOP first, then I had it create a diagram for the workflow in in there. If we can do that with an audio file where there was zero intention

@Trent [1:37:28]: For an SOP What can we do if we intentionally record audio for this purpose.

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [1:37:36]: I, that definitely needs to be in the proposal, like that SOP and that workflow needs to be

@Chris Andrade [1:37:41]: Exactly

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [1:37:42]: There.

@Chris Andrade [1:37:42]: And and

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [1:37:43]: And that's, that's the golden nugget right there.

@Chris Andrade [1:37:46]: Yep

@Trent [1:37:47]: And we talked about, we talked about the, where this spider webs to because this, this can be literally

@Chris Andrade [1:37:47]: And that's

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [1:37:54]: You a solution

@Trent [1:37:54]: This, this is not just one solution.

@Chris Andrade [1:37:58]: Yeah

@Trent [1:37:58]: This actually this spider webs into so many opportunities for him to improve his business the way he delivers things to his clients, the way that he operates his business, the way that he communicates with people internally and externally. The way that he trains his personnel

@Chris Andrade [1:38:17]: Dude, honestly, Trent, like the more you're talking, like I need this motherfucker set up in my office.

@Trent [1:38:23]: Well, I know, I know we need this shit too, right?

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [1:38:25]: Yeah, yeah, you, and then, and then he also say to say that we, you just built your our own fireflies.

@Trent [1:38:27]: Is all that hardware put out. In a way, yeah, in a way

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [1:38:36]: Yeah

@Trent [1:38:38]: Yeah, so anyway, we, we totally went down rabbit holes, McKel on all of the things that we could extract from just this process here, both now Can gain value, and then as it builds a larger repository, it can just sort of amplify.

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [1:38:56]: You know, scale of so many things.

@Trent [1:38:58]: Its scales to so many different possibilities of improving the business.

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [1:39:01]: I think yeah, like, and then this even implementing this would save him time and money today, today in his business.

@Chris Andrade [1:39:06]: And today

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [1:39:07]: And like that, I think that right there is our self, like we, we throw him that.

@Chris Andrade [1:39:07]: Today And just so you guys know. Sorry, go ahead, sorry

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [1:39:13]: And we can be. No, we show him that, that needs to be in the presentation, like front and center, like that's, that's the value we're adding on top of everything else that we're we're researching, but yeah, 100%. That's a no-brainer.

@Chris Andrade [1:39:25]: And just so you guys know, when I first talked to Kelsey about this whole opportunity back on November 4th. That's where it all led from, just developing some sort of voice transcriber that would sit inside of his office, and that's what he perked his ears up to.

@Trent [1:39:45]: That like he already, like, there was kind of already the idea but didn't have the, have it fleshed out, right, on what the possibilities were.

@Chris Andrade [1:39:51]: Right. I just knew that it was possible to set a recording device to transcribe back then. I told, but that's ultimately like that's what got like, if I could do that, Kelsey, would you be interested? He's like, yeah.

@Chris Andrade [1:40:09]: Like that's what, that's what, that's how all this started, if I'm being 100% real of the, just the opportunity that I could even give or offer a suggestion.

@Trent [1:40:21]: Yeah, that's awesome because it like really, you just had the knowledge that you can use like fireflies as just a simple tool example to record ran to transcribe audio and video and meetings, and you cant value out of that. Not knowing that there's so much more behind it as a possibility to prevent that.

@Chris Andrade [1:40:38]: Yeah, because I knew even then, like you said, the spider would if, if, if, if we could just give him that, the spider web from that alone would, would make him want to invest in more iterations, because we just put one and look how much it's already improved his operational efficiency on a daily basis. Like, so much so that he doesn't need a piece of software to tell him how much he got improved. Like you can see it, you can feel it, and you can hear it.

@Trent [1:41:04]: Yeah M McKel will lose him for a second. He messaged in the chat saying he's going to the garage. So he'll drop in and out.

@Chris Andrade [1:41:14]: I don't have a fucking solid picture of Kelsey, it looks like.

@Trent [1:41:17]: Like, does he have something on his website or his LinkedIn or a social media or does he, does he, or just ask him, just say, hey, look, send us a good picture of you.

@Chris Andrade [1:41:27]: Yeah. I'm so pissed that I don't have one. Let me, before, let me, let me check out Facebook.

@Trent [1:41:33]: And And if he says, well, why, just you know.

@Chris Andrade [1:41:36]: I know, I know Maybe he's not gonna be greed out, I don't think like that.

@Trent [1:41:42]: Yeah, he's been like, dude, bro, why you need you know healthy from me, that's weird.

@Chris Andrade [1:41:44]: Yeah yeah I have a really good relationship. I I got to be really good. I know that one might be a little weird, I gonna laugh.

@Trent [1:41:53]: Well just tell him no dick dicks, man. Come on.

@Chris Andrade [1:41:56]: Yeah, right. This is a, a, oh, what's up Li? Oh, by the way, I got this guy named Chip Larson. He is a quality engineer for a, a very high tech get like you got one of the biggest gas companies in the United States.

@Chris Andrade [1:42:16]: And he's developing AI systems. He was has this initiative that his company is making him do to see how he can use AI to save money, but because there are gas And Oil industry, that you, you can't have like all their shit is proprietary, right?

@Trent [1:42:36]: Yeah, it's all locked down, yeah.

@Chris Andrade [1:42:37]: But he is using cloud code And he would love to talk to you guys. when he just said.

@Trent [1:42:49]: Can, can he do like a like consultation work. I mean, we can definitely, you know, help.

@Chris Andrade [1:42:52]: No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. He just wants to meet you guys because I, I work out, and he's my, he's a, he's a, I work out with him and he's like, he's one of my

@Trent [1:42:59]: Yeah. Yeah

@Chris Andrade [1:43:05]: Mentors in life and

@Trent [1:43:06]: Yeah Yeah, yeah And we chat

@Chris Andrade [1:43:10]: Yeah, he just really he he said that he has been working in a lot in cloud code and he's been hearing a little bit about what I've been talking about and like I said, I told him like, bro, I'm not technical by any means. Like, I told them that what I did was cloude on installing my environment was like a really big deal for me, right? And yeah, anyways

@Chris Andrade [1:43:31]: I guess he exposed some shit through cloud code, and he's like, they probably would like to be aware of it because they, he's apparently yesterday he built like two apps in one day with it, and

@Trent [1:43:45]: Yeah

@Chris Andrade [1:43:45]: There was

@Trent [1:43:45]: That's where I'm at too

@Chris Andrade [1:43:47]: Big bugs

@Trent [1:43:47]: I'm try I'm trying to figure that part out. So I'd be interested to hear what he has to say.

@Chris Andrade [1:43:52]: Yeah, he, he do. Eventually, like, he wants, he, he hates his job. Am I sharing my Skype? Hugh hates his job But he has to do it. I think regardless though, just for him to come and meet you guys would be real like an honor. Like he's another John Potts.

@Trent [1:44:04]: Yeah

@Chris Andrade [1:44:11]: Right?

@Trent [1:44:11]: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

@Chris Andrade [1:44:12]: And yeah, he, I worked out with him last night and he's like, yeah, just, I'll be, I have a pretty wide open tomorrow if you guys are on, just ping me. I'll see how I can hop over. It's like sweet.

@Matthew Kerns [1:44:23]: Yeah, right on it Know

@Trent [1:44:24]: Yeah.

@Matthew Kerns [1:44:25]: And the trent for the app creation stuff. I, I worked on Android apps in my career at Amazon. So if you want to jam on that together, we can do that.

@Trent [1:44:34]: Yeah, dude, for like, so This This idea Of Finding a way that we can have a very easy way to trigger, there's so much intelligence on a phone, a smartphone, right? And you can build apps and software if we can just, if we can really, most of our solutions should be

@Trent [1:44:58]: Software because software is the easiest thing to create with cloud code. It's the easiest thing to replicate. It's the easiest thing and fastest thing to be able to make revisions and iterations on. We don't want to make hardware if we can avoid it, right? So,

@Chris Andrade [1:45:11]: And most importantly, make money on. You saying.

@Trent [1:45:14]: Absolutely, absolutely. That's kind of like we want to build cool shit and we want to make money off of it. So we want to make a living off of it. so if we could have a way that we can have just a microphone that feeds into

@Matthew Kerns [1:45:26]: If I don't come to

@Trent [1:45:27]: An app that can talk directly to an agent, which I know there are people working on this. I mean, I've see stuff when I'm searching like Google or I use Gemini to try to let it explore. There are people working on this, but I think

@Trent [1:45:43]: Some way that you can talk to a thing that's attached to you. To do these transcriptions, but also be able to trigger things, automations, or

@Matthew Kerns [1:45:53]: Yeah

@Trent [1:45:55]: So that's That would really Amp this up of being able to Do this. So I don't know

@Matthew Kerns [1:46:02]: Like I've been thinking like so live streaming of just like a meeting like when as we're meeting, like literally yesterday when we were when we were talking, like we talked for like 2 hours, OK, and then the first hour or first hour and a half or whatever was like so much like there was so much good stuff, and we needed, we needed the transcription to be able to update the the plan.

@Matthew Kerns [1:46:32]: And like What if that could just be done in the background. So as we're working, then like we have the newest version, you know, and like, so

@Trent [1:46:41]: Yeah, that would be sweet, like doing what we do manually right now, but as you're having a meeting and having a discussion, you can like turn something on where it's listening to you to actively be building the plan in the background.

@Matthew Kerns [1:46:52]: Yeah. Yeah, like that, the video idea I had, what if, like, it could just have gone off and done that. Like I had to go off and create it, which I can show you guys, and I don't know, like, I don't know if you can hear the audio from my screen, but it'd be cool, yeah.

@Trent [1:47:09]: Currently no

@Matthew Kerns [1:47:11]: What?

@Trent [1:47:12]: Like if you're, if it's making audio right now, no.

@Matthew Kerns [1:47:15]: No, OK. Well, I haven't played it yet. So let's see, once I play, and I haven't watched this video yet, but. Yeah, I'll see what happens. Let me know if you can't hear anything cause it does have audio. To work. We make no money. Then everything changed. All right, when the carriage belt slips on the T-120. Here's the fastest way to diagnose it. His words became SOPs, training, freedom. If I don't come to work, we make no money. OK, so it's just 5 seconds.

@Trent [1:47:40]: Oh my gosh Oh my gosh, did you see that, Chris?

@Chris Andrade [1:47:45]: Rewind that

@Matthew Kerns [1:47:47]: OK

@Trent [1:47:47]: Play it again

@Matthew Kerns [1:47:49]: Damn, everything changed. When the carriage belt slips on a T120, here's the fastest way to diagnose it. His words became SOPs, training, freedom. If I don't come to work, we make no money. Then everything changed when a carriage belt slips on the T-120, here's the fastest way to diagnose it. His words became SOPs, training, freedom. If I don't go work,

@Chris Andrade [1:48:09]: De The opening scene of your presentation, Doc.

@Trent [1:48:17]: Yeah, you, yeah, like we don't have to say anything, right? You just like seriously just play it and just step away.

@Matthew Kerns [1:48:17]: Yeah.

@Chris Andrade [1:48:24]: Hey, hey, I, Kelsey, fucking forget isn't the wife's name.

@Matthew Kerns [1:48:25]: Yeah

@Chris Andrade [1:48:30]: Thanks for meeting with us, just wanted to, Alyssa, no, that's, that's it, that's the, that's the admin ladies' name, but it be like

@Matthew Kerns [1:48:31]: I listen

@Trent [1:48:35]: I OK OK

@Chris Andrade [1:48:42]: Like this is how I've been envisioning it, like, it's just that, you know, I want, I wanna make an introduction, like, team, you know, to say something about yourself when we go through the room, and then they'll say something about themselves, you're like cake, you know, still, we're still working out, but we know we're here to present to you this. This is what we've been working on and just go ahead and

@Chris Andrade [1:49:04]: We'll push play. Yeah, like, we gotta work that out because I wanna make it seem like seamless cause to be honest, this would be my my first legit presentation.

@Trent [1:49:04]: So, yeah, right.

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [1:49:09]: No, I think

@Trent [1:49:13]: If Mikel didn't see that, I don't think.

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [1:49:14]: Chris.

@Chris Andrade [1:49:15]: Yeah.

@Matthew Kerns [1:49:16]: Yeah

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [1:49:17]: Some of it, but it's, that's all I needed to see. But Chris, essentially we have to remember the advice we got from Darren, that evre. It's like, honestly, Chris, like all you got to do is make the introduction. I think we should go through me, Trent, and Matthew should go through the whole thing. And then you're just there to like,

@Chris Andrade [1:49:28]: Yeah.

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [1:49:32]: Close it. I, I guess I did like, you know, I think we'll, we'll close them and then you just sit there if they have any questions afterwards.

@Chris Andrade [1:49:35]: Yep. 100% agree, 100% agree, because I, if I could I focus so much on the relationship, I think it puts me automatically disadvantage, right?

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [1:49:40]: The Yeah, you already built that Yeah. And he already knows you, right? So we'll go in, we'll introduce ourselves, Tom short a little bit about our backgrounds, and then we'll get into the presentation how that that looks.

@Chris Andrade [1:49:55]: To The Mikhail I just see that video? I don't you seen the video.

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [1:49:58]: OK, yeah, I do want No, I didn't see the video

@Trent [1:50:01]: Yeah. Oh yeah, see the video

@Chris Andrade [1:50:03]: Yeah, she's been

@Trent [1:50:04]: But yeah, so share your screen again, show him that video or send him a link if you can. I don't know, whatever.

@Chris Andrade [1:50:05]: OK.

@Matthew Kerns [1:50:09]: Yeah, I guess I'll send you guys the link if I.

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [1:50:10]: Shared it Or my

@Matthew Kerns [1:50:14]: If I don't come to work, we make no money. Then everything changed. All right, when the carriage belt slips on the T-120, here's the fastest way to diagnose it. His words became SOPs, training, freedom. If I don't come to work, we make no money. Then everything changed when the carriage belt slips on the T-120, here's the fastest way to diagnose it. His words became SOPs, training, freedom.

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [1:50:29]: Yes Yes

@Matthew Kerns [1:50:36]: So as long as I

@Chris Andrade [1:50:37]: So I kidney

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [1:50:38]: 100%. We can even make that an animated vision and, like, you know what I mean. That's so far, but

@Matthew Kerns [1:50:44]: We can do different styles like literally like, that was draft one and like whatever our imaginations come up with, we can come up, we can make multiple, we can like we can

@Trent [1:50:44]: I mean

@Chris Andrade [1:50:54]: Like

@Matthew Kerns [1:50:56]: Find the best one. We can stitch multiple together cause it only lets you do like 5 or 10 seconds at a time, I think.

@Chris Andrade [1:51:01]: Hold on, hold on, look what I just found, look what I, look what I just found. Let me share my cue.

@Matthew Kerns [1:51:02]: But

@Trent [1:51:06]: You got a picture of it

@Chris Andrade [1:51:07]: No, I got even a better. We now we got his whole audio. Today we're gonna be changing the credit on this. XL 4000 HPage. So you got all these logos up and everything. You see what I mean by a red beard? This is number 8 A #1 song like, like we can take this video because he's talking about how to align print heads, you know.

@Matthew Kerns [1:51:23]: Yeah

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [1:51:26]: Yeah yeah

@Trent [1:51:30]: Dude, it's, it's long too. Like he's doing a whole thing here.

@Chris Andrade [1:51:34]: The

@Trent [1:51:34]: Look how long it is

@Chris Andrade [1:51:35]: Download some paper

@Matthew Kerns [1:51:37]: Yeah

@Chris Andrade [1:51:39]: It is an SOP

@Trent [1:51:39]: Dang. I'm, yeah, it's a whole another SOP right there.

@Chris Andrade [1:51:43]: How do I download this?

@Trent [1:51:45]: I don't know if you can I mean, right now, the quickest, easiest thing that used to be find a good likeness of him and take a couple pictures of them and send it into the video, the, the Matthews able to create, that's like the quickest, easiest thing that we can

@Chris Andrade [1:51:51]: Or

@Matthew Kerns [1:52:02]: I think I can

@Trent [1:52:04]: Create something with, but if we could find a way to get that video, we can also turn it into a

@Chris Andrade [1:52:09]: Look at it, so they only got one like one comment. When was this made? Fucking damn, dude.

@Trent [1:52:09]: SOP

@Chris Andrade [1:52:17]: 25, 24.

@Trent [1:52:18]: Mhm 2 years ago

@Chris Andrade [1:52:20]: 2 years ago

@Trent [1:52:21]: Almost, almost.

@Chris Andrade [1:52:23]: And so in that 2 years, he's only done 123 4 post. That's horrible

@Matthew Kerns [1:52:31]: This this But see he probably doesn't even want to scale because he can't like.

@Chris Andrade [1:52:37]: It

@Matthew Kerns [1:52:38]: I mean, he probably does, but he could, he couldn't support all of you, he can support more scale without SOPs and trainings and stuff. So like.

@Chris Andrade [1:52:46]: That's that that's his biggest constraint like, like literally what your videos just said, it can't do anything cause he has to work. With the company with

@Matthew Kerns [1:52:53]: So then So then later, like once we've unlocked that, we can also work on his social media to just drive more traffic.

@Chris Andrade [1:53:02]: Well, so that's, that's where another thing that Mikhail that I've been wanting to touch with you on is about our video production site, because it is quickly gathering that speed about Offering a social media or any media or marketing, I think it's an I don't wanna say it's an easy market to tap, but I already, already started tapping into it.

@Chris Andrade [1:53:29]: And because I am the drone and the videographer. It's all there already created Waves, if you will, of opportunity for us to make more, I mean, another package to add on to our brand of what we can offer because this is technically a strategy in business, right? And if we're offering strategy solutions

@Chris Andrade [1:53:55]: You know

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [1:53:58]: Yeah, yeah, no, no that that makes sense, 100%, and we have not AA to make that happen. So it's just about getting in there, delivering value, and then taking it step by step. I think once we get this stuff going, then why not, you know?

@Chris Andrade [1:54:13]: Exactly

@Matthew Kerns [1:54:14]: It, it's so crazy nowadays with AI and like all the tools that we have, it's almost like the speed to creating the thing is like way quicker, like we have, as soon as we have the idea for something, we can turn around on it and, and execute on a lot of, a lot of things that a lot more things than before. I think there definitely still are things that will require complexity in working through, but just like the team that we have

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [1:54:27]: Not there

@Chris Andrade [1:54:42]: Yes

@Matthew Kerns [1:54:44]: Where we just want to go, go, go is such an advantage because we could like, things can get done

@Chris Andrade [1:54:49]: I

@Matthew Kerns [1:54:51]: People just need to do, put the input and do the things. So if we have 4 of us doing things all day, like, We're gonna, we're gonna make massive

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [1:55:02]: I, I, I think

@Matthew Kerns [1:55:02]: Progress

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [1:55:03]: Potter 100 100%. I think potter mechanics.

@Chris Andrade [1:55:05]: And, and this

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [1:55:08]: Has like a great opportunity, like, you know.

@Chris Andrade [1:55:08]: They

@Matthew Kerns [1:55:11]: Yeah

@Chris Andrade [1:55:13]: Henry Kelly's, it's kind of hard to hear you.

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [1:55:18]: Can you hear me better now

@Chris Andrade [1:55:20]: Yeah, yeah, it's almost seems like you're like you're on like speed up version.

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [1:55:26]: Yeah, I'm, I'm in a building right now and it's like, my, my connection's close. Let me see if I can get them out. Give me one sec.

@Chris Andrade [1:55:30]: Oh Yeah, I got a screenshot of Mr. Kelsey here. Let me, Should I put this in our slack in like a see you again, like, where would I put?

@Matthew Kerns [1:55:46]: You could just You put it in this chat just cause It'll get shared with the meeting, with the channel anyway. But yeah, we can, we should organize it. At some point, like after.

@Chris Andrade [1:56:03]: I think that, I mean, even him holding that paper, it's perfect.

@Matthew Kerns [1:56:08]: Yeah

@Chris Andrade [1:56:08]: I mean, his logos in his on it and then let me see if I can actually download the JPEG to his logo, actually. Slaughter mechanics.

@Matthew Kerns [1:56:25]: It looks like you had a creative a brand new one. I can't remix that and add a photo to it with Sora. But I'll just use the same prompt, so.

@Chris Andrade [1:56:36]: Oh yeah,

@Matthew Kerns [1:56:37]: Oh, it says we don't create videos from images that include people. So What I've done before is I, I made a profile of myself on Sora, so

@Matthew Kerns [1:56:54]: I mean, that's a lot of involvement from him to to to go through like, you have to, I mean, it's not a crazy amount, like you just upload a video of yourself like saying a few numbers, and he could create a profile of himself on Sora, that could be shared with us and then we could do it, but like, yeah, I don't know.

@Matthew Kerns [1:57:15]: If that's Something that we wanna ask of them.

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [1:57:17]: Does it have to be before cause Does it have to be so cause I know, I, I just don't know what they are, but I can do some research. I know there's some Like ones where you can upload a picture of yourself, it turns it into like a animated like version.

@Chris Andrade [1:57:29]: Yeah

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [1:57:31]: Like stories and stuff

@Trent [1:57:32]: There's, there's some stuff, there's some stuff in the content

@Matthew Kerns [1:57:33]: Yeah

@Trent [1:57:36]: In the, if we go to the accelerator in the courses. There is for content creation, for I think YouTube mastery. There are some areas there that talk about tools of being able to generate logos and videos and animations.

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [1:58:01]: Yeah, so we can look that up. You can tie that together.

@Trent [1:58:02]: Yeah Yeah. I mean, so it depends on how much, what level we of work we want to put into it, right? We, we just We wanna close the guy, right? We want to show him the vision. We want to be able to give him, you know, what he needs to understand what we're willing to like where we want to work on and deliver value for him.

@Trent [1:58:25]: I just, whatever we create, I don't want to get in the weeds of just creating content that is for the presentation only. Yeah.

@Chris Andrade [1:58:30]: Right

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [1:58:32]: Yeah

@Chris Andrade [1:58:33]: I think as long as we can contest and talk to the options that are available. That's all they need to know is like, again, it's the pathway, right? There's a 1000 paths in front of us.

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [1:58:35]: Right.

@Trent [1:58:42]: Yeah

@Chris Andrade [1:58:46]: How are we gonna hold, I wish to.

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [1:58:48]: OK, for now we We keep things simple, right? And just focus on the, the slide deck and then the actual, like the visual, and then if we have time for the video before Wednesday, then we can throw that together. If it's good enough, we can show them. If not, whatever. But also the SOP and that golden nugget, and then I actually have an offer ready and hopefully have them signed that day.

@Chris Andrade [1:58:54]: Yep

@Trent [1:59:03]: But

@Chris Andrade [1:59:10]: Yep

@Trent [1:59:11]: So we

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [1:59:12]: And I think, yeah.

@Trent [1:59:14]: Yeah, we, We can just put a placeholder or an earmark or a whatever, say, hey, look, if we have the time, we'll come back and do video. We'll do an animation or a video to add into the presentation. Right? So I, I, I mean, shoot, the video that you already created, even if it doesn't have his likeness in it.

@Chris Andrade [1:59:35]: Right I mean that alone is good and so

@Trent [1:59:37]: I mean To be honest, I put that in there and then if we want to come back and refine it, let's do it.

@Chris Andrade [1:59:39]: Can 100%, 100%, I, I would say, so do we have a minute to kind of just go and like discuss how we want to walk through to look and just so it's dictated for us to kind of follow.

@Trent [1:59:57]: Sure.

@Chris Andrade [1:59:59]: So, I'm gonna be meeting up with them in the morning. I'm gonna be setting up the, I want cameras and stuff, so I'll be setting up that environment And then they have a, a couch area, where there is a huge TV.

@Chris Andrade [2:00:15]: That I'll be connecting my laptop to. Then I will bring you guys in, on, I don't know, it'll be, I'm assuming either probably Google Chats meet, right? So we can Do we want to get the video recording on that or?

@Trent [2:00:33]: Yeah, I think we should definitely get video recording and from what we understand, we don't get it.

@Chris Andrade [2:00:37]: Of that Of that of that meeting, and then, you know, make the introductions, you guys walked through the room and, and then after the injection is made, I believe Mikhail, this is where you would start introducing the, you know, walking them through the offering.

@Trent [2:00:42]: Yeah.

@Chris Andrade [2:00:57]: I'm making them understand what I have, and then The solutions to the technical aspects, you know, I would like Trent to kind of touch on the SOP side and ultimately Walk him through understanding by creating one thing, we're creating a level of multiple other things at the same time.

@Trent [2:01:19]: Mhm

@Chris Andrade [2:01:19]: Right? And then you you guys kind of just, you know, tag team that conversation on the technical side, and ultimately,

@Trent [2:01:20]: Mhm

@Chris Andrade [2:01:33]: Walk him through What the possibilities are, and then Mikhael will be the one that kind of hone in the idea of, hey You see how many options you got? Now it's kind of just figure out how which ones that we want to hone in on first, and then

@Chris Andrade [2:01:54]: I mean, I, I, I think if we can kind of contest to that kind of flow of who's handling what in the conversation, and then my, I'm like literally just shut up in the back room And just kind of just watching you guys do the thing.

@Trent [2:02:08]: Yup, we need to Yeah,

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [2:02:12]: Different

@Trent [2:02:13]: You do, you know, introductions, right, and an overview kind of like in the very beginning and then value in the middle and then the the stuff at the end is the the business stuff, right? The, hey, This is, you know You're talking about the agreements and the kind of whatever.

@Chris Andrade [2:02:30]: But you need me to get to send to document me out right now here. I got my iPad ready.

@Trent [2:02:34]: We need to, yeah, I mean, we need to have that ready too, right? That, that service agreement or what have you needs to be ready.

@Chris Andrade [2:02:41]: Letter of intent, whatever we, we talked about all alongside, I think that would go a long way. Maybe if we don't make it, maybe, like, I don't know. We'll see, we'll fill them out, we'll have it on the ready. I don't wanna be like, OK, you gotta sign now, you know.

@Trent [2:02:44]: Yeah. Yeah, yeah, it doesn't have to be that way, right? So we can, we can

@Trent [2:03:01]: We can come at it from the The angle of he's gonna sign. We can, you know, hey, when do you want to get started, right? But at the same time, if he says, oh, I need a minute to think about it. Let me, let me review this with my wife and we'll talk about it on our own terms. There's no reason that we can't be

@Chris Andrade [2:03:10]: Right Mhm.

@Trent [2:03:21]: You know, reasonable people understanding that he needs to take a second to think about what we're trying to propose to him, so.

@Chris Andrade [2:03:26]: But Let's flip the coin now. Let's say that this shit is just like they're so wild and they're like, OK, like that's gonna kill us like how we did, right? And, and really ultimately at the end of the day, we're going to be able to take that back and watch those social cues like the them eyebrows perk, and like, at what point did they perk at?

@Trent [2:03:27]: Yeah.

@Chris Andrade [2:03:49]: Where did they like, cause that would ultimately help us for the next one.

@Trent [2:03:49]: Mhm In

@Chris Andrade [2:03:54]: You know

@Trent [2:03:55]: Yeah, it helps with find our message.

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [2:03:56]: I think. 1 100%. I think what we should do is either lay out like a hay, like a phase one agreement, however many days you decide that is, like a phase one, and then like a deliverable and then like an overall 12 month if you like give them two options or two packages. And then if not, like, say, hey, if you need some time to think about it, no problem. Everything we discussed to you will be shared with you, and you can keep that regardless of.

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [2:04:19]: You decide to work with this or not. I'm, I'm sure he, he will work with this, but just in case, like, you know, cause we're giving a value, I think everything we put together is actually like pretty good, like, you know, it's actual stuff that he could use regardless of if he wants to use us or not. I think going forward that could just be like our way, like our oper way, you know.

@Trent [2:04:34]: Yes, it is, yes, I totally agree with you, Miguel, that we are providing a lot of value just right out of the gate that we're not even intending on charging for. We're just trying to show him that we're trying to really build something for him and then if he wants to have a longer term engagement, that's when we really ramped things up, right?

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [2:04:44]: Mhm. Mhm

@Chris Andrade [2:04:54]: And what makes me excited is most

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [2:04:55]: But we, we should definitely do this.

@Chris Andrade [2:04:57]: Go ahead.

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [2:04:57]: Yeah, we should have those agreements ready. We should just, we should be ready on our side and then also just be understanding as well.

@Trent [2:05:03]: But yeah, we gotta be ready to take payment, right? I mean, like, at the end of the day, we have to be ready for him to say, take my money.

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [2:05:11]: 100%. What does that look like to, like we, we definitely need to discuss that too,

@Trent [2:05:12]: So, you know, we did talk about that. I don't think you were in the room, how would that look like?

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [2:05:17]: Yeah.

@Chris Andrade [2:05:19]: We, I think, I don't know if you had, Trent said he had some payment channels already set up, I don't know if you do or not because it's obviously through your LLC.

@Trent [2:05:32]: Yeah. So, here's the thing. I have Panda Doc, I, I paid for it, so it gives us the ability to create a professional document. That's what I sent you guys the and, you know, the mutual non non-disclosure and we can make it pretty. Like what I sent you was just basically just words, right? But we can make it pretty and professional with the templates, and it can also have the e-signature stuff built into it so he can just do it right there.

@Chris Andrade [2:05:43]: Yeah

@Trent [2:06:02]: And it also has the ability to put in a payment. Method. So if we wanted to go through that channel, we can. I also have the ability, I'm already set up for QuickBooks. I invoice people and take payment through QuickBooks too. So

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [2:06:10]: OK

@Trent [2:06:17]: I don't know where you're at, Mikel, but I'm just saying that we can do that if we need to.

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [2:06:23]: Yeah, I think if it makes sense to do that since it's already ready. I haven't really I haven't, I've thought about it. I've talked to Matthew with his stuff. I haven't really set something out, but if you're already ready to go, I don't mind going that way. The quick, I've used cookbooks as professional, so.

@Trent [2:06:34]: Yeah Yeah, that's the whole goal, right? Is that like the, the number one thing, like not number one thing, but like one thing that I thought about is like, we need to have it, you know, a tool that's brand agnostic

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [2:06:43]: Thing

@Trent [2:06:48]: So something we can make sure we put a rise group on so that, you know, we can look like we're uniform, and then also it needs to be a professional presentation, and it needs to be digital, and it needs to also be capable of being automated. We're not going to automate it now, but we're gonna automate in the future.

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [2:07:03]: Yeah, whatever

@Trent [2:07:05]: Yeah.

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [2:07:05]: Yeah.

@Trent [2:07:06]: Yeah. So, and that was kind of the goal with trying to use Panda Doc because Pandaoc brings a lot of those pieces together for us,

@Chris Andrade [2:07:13]: And, and Mike, I dropped the logo for plotter mechanics in this chat. And I think we talked about it when we saw the example yesterday for color code, a color coding it towards their brand.

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [2:07:21]: Standing up

@Chris Andrade [2:07:28]: Would

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [2:07:29]: I'll do that. I, yeah, I, I'm gonna feed the information through. I'm gonna do one more, presentation.

@Chris Andrade [2:07:34]: Oh

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [2:07:35]: And then let you guys read over it and then I'll add the, the colors and stuff, and then go through it like that.

@Chris Andrade [2:07:43]: 00 sorry, John, I just rolled since we're talking on it real quick, I Something that I didn't notice that we had a part of our requirements that I think it's very necessary is that if any client we on board, if they do not have already a brand kit.

@Chris Andrade [2:08:02]: To send out To people like us. We need to provide one for them.

@Trent [2:08:09]: Wait, what do you mean

@Chris Andrade [2:08:09]: You get

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [2:08:11]: What does that look like?

@Chris Andrade [2:08:12]: If you pull up Canva and just type in a brand kit, right? It tells you

@Trent [2:08:14]: No Yeah

@Chris Andrade [2:08:17]: It gives you all the color codes, the fonts, the headers, the types, like

@Trent [2:08:23]: You're saying should, like if they don't have anything at all, then we should just be able to package them a brand kit.

@Chris Andrade [2:08:29]: Yeah. I, I, I, again, that's the foundation of a company, right? It's, I, I think we that we would like to incorporate that because again we're trying to anticipate their needs, and when we onboard customers and when we actually signed them, I think we need to have that brand kit in their portfolio, so we are knowing what their

@Chris Andrade [2:08:54]: Color codes, their fonts are, we don't have to go ping them or ask a question, you know.

@Trent [2:08:57]: Yeah. Right, right, yeah. I'm, I'm with you on that. There should be a way that we just, as part of our Client.

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [2:09:07]: OK.

@Trent [2:09:08]: For not

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [2:09:08]: List

@Trent [2:09:10]: Yeah, the, the, the client portfolio or whatever we wanna call it, when they come in and we start doing stuff for them, including where we're at right now, we should have one for water mechanics in the future.

@Chris Andrade [2:09:19]: Right. And then, then we, and so I think I wanted it emphasize on that because I think that would make us look good and be like, oh, Miguel, like, oh, Kelsey, you're Mrs. I don't even know their last name. do you guys have a brand kit?

@Chris Andrade [2:09:35]: That we can attach to your and if they say no, but Oh great, we're, we'll create one for you, you know, we'll just have to work another system thing that add onto the list of opportunities that we're going to help them with, you know. It's, it, it, it may seem a little

@Trent [2:09:39]: OK The smoking is true

@Chris Andrade [2:09:52]: Exactly, and it, but it may seem little, but it is kind of a lot of work to actually put that together. Like I had to put it together or start putting it together for Remus development And I was like, fuck, it's actually, if you don't do it in the process of building the website, the logos, kind of a pain in the ass.

@Trent [2:10:02]: Mhm. Yeah Yeah, going backwards is a pain, yeah.

@Chris Andrade [2:10:13]: 100%.

@Trent [2:10:14]: Yeah, yeah, so,

@Chris Andrade [2:10:16]: OK, so that's why I just want to add, and I didn't mean to interrupt your thought there.

@Trent [2:10:19]: What, what, where are we putting all of these file assets, like the files themselves. I know that we have a channel now for in Slack. But for files and things. So for example, the MP3 file, the MP3 file is currently on Google Drive for in Chris's Google Drive, but I've created diagrams and a transcript and a, you know, a

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [2:10:32]: I have, I have a.

@Chris Andrade [2:10:44]: Right.

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [2:10:45]: Burn area, but I do have an RI group, folder, for email and I can just share it. Give you guys access and we can just like kind of organize it. I haven't done that yet, but like we could drop like A client Folder like I like how Trent had his, Mattiades about, like ongoing projects and

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [2:11:06]: New projects like we could, we could separate it out and just throw all of the information for that client under their folder, in, in Google.

@Trent [2:11:14]: Yeah Yeah, I think that we need to have, so we can like we've got too many places, right that we can put stuff. So we, we've got slack, we can put stuff in. We've got notion we can put stuff in. We've got Google Drive of many people's Google Drive, so I think we need to just

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [2:11:32]: What do you like

@Trent [2:11:32]: Try to do all the assets in one place if possible. So,

@Chris Andrade [2:11:35]: Is that a right Google Drive?

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [2:11:36]: Should be

@Matthew Kerns [2:11:38]: I think so, it could be in the in the.

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [2:11:38]: Yeah, I mean, whatever, I, I'm, I'm open to whatever.

@Matthew Kerns [2:11:41]: And then the other place like Slack, we can like work in Slack and then someday we'll have something that just pulls assets from Slack into Google Drive into the central repository and just does it for us.

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [2:11:41]: Whatever makes sense

@Trent [2:11:57]: So, yeah, and they're, I don't know to what degree, but there are integrations that I've already, I've denied, but they're there for notion and Google Drive and all sorts of stuff that slack integrates with, so I don't know to what degree that those are set up, but yes, this is why we wanted to kind of get into slack is because we have so many options to take what we're doing, our communications, whether it be files and whatnot, and we can automate on it.

@Chris Andrade [2:12:26]: So that channel that you created for plotter Mechanics. I, is there a way like in teams, like you can create a channel and then have folders or files for that channel in that, so my thought is

@Trent [2:12:26]: So But

@Chris Andrade [2:12:39]: Cause for me I upload Let's just say 64 gigs of video and pictures were just plotter mechanics alone. I uploaded that to my, my Google Drive, right? Does it make sense to actually then take that and upload it to our main or create a link system to a folder or client management within to go, because you guys already have access to my Google Drive.

@Chris Andrade [2:13:06]: You just need to know where to go to get it, so we create that repository or directory of links Would that work? or do we actually want to create a folder and template of clients and then build that template up uniformal uni using the uniform method and just continue copy pasting as new clients keep coming on.

@Trent [2:13:32]: I think, I think that we actually need both, which it this they're they're

@Chris Andrade [2:13:38]: That's true.

@Trent [2:13:39]: There there's the planning and the theory.

@Chris Andrade [2:13:41]: Right

@Trent [2:13:42]: Of what we, what we intend on doing, but my experience is even when you have that plan and that organization is that not everyone, including the person that implements it follows it all the time.

@Chris Andrade [2:13:45]: Right. Yeah, yeah I Right

@Trent [2:13:57]: So somehow we're gonna have to kind of accommodate both methodologies with one of them being primary and the other and a method of the secondary. So right now the, I think the best way to try to figure out how to do this is really to just create a Google Drive or a shared drive of somehow, and we put it all in 11, folder structure.

@Chris Andrade [2:13:58]: So Got it

@Chris Andrade [2:14:16]: Yeah I agree

@Trent [2:14:21]: Currently and then we also need to have the ability somehow to be able to link things, but knowing that they are part of plotter mechanics,

@Chris Andrade [2:14:22]: Yeah Yeah, so like I have like a main central repository for like the documentations that we're putting together And then

@Chris Andrade [2:14:38]: If you needed pictures, well, those are gonna be over here. Or videos or whatever have you. Is that what you're kind of like suggesting.

@Trent [2:14:49]: Yes, so here's just, here's the client plotter mechanics. Internal channel, OK? And here's all the messages that we've been putting in here. And as you add things, like, this is what I was saying before is you can forward things and if, if you guys, Matthew and Mikel didn't hear this or don't know this. If you've posted something in another general channel.

@Trent [2:15:13]: And you want it to be relative to plotter mechanics, for example. You can go to that message, yeah, you can copy the link, but you can also click forward. And you can forward it not to an individual necessarily but to a channel. So, now it exists at its original location, but it also exists in the

@Trent [2:15:32]: Potter mechanics channel So that's what actually did, I did here is I forwarded this.

@Matthew Kerns [2:15:34]: Yeah

@Chris Andrade [2:15:39]: Yeah OK

@Trent [2:15:40]: A dog was in this tab up here. There's a files tab. The files tab actually took my forwarded message. And it is in this tab. So now you can see all the files that are related to The conversations

@Chris Andrade [2:15:55]: So what's preventing us from creating a fuller system in here.

@Trent [2:15:59]: I don't know if we can create an organization structure like a hierarchy, right now it looks like it's organized by photos and videos and documents, which isn't terrible, but when we start putting videos and audio files, and I don't know how much storage we actually have in Slack.

@Chris Andrade [2:16:12]: Right, right, right. How much storage do you got, Mikael, on, on your drive? Do you know?

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [2:16:23]: Not off the top of my head, but I'll have to look. Probably not a lot, probably normal. I don't think that's it.

@Chris Andrade [2:16:27]: I got I got 5 terabytes on my Google Drive.

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [2:16:32]: Probably 3, or do we need, is there a way maybe like We could keep the audio video, maybe separate and just maybe extract it for the.

@Chris Andrade [2:16:44]: Yeah, I say nicer That's what I'm thinking about. I'll just, since I'm pretty much doing the video and I'll just keep that on my Google Drive and then we'll use yours for like the main repository for like the documents and the all that, and then what until we figure out a system, we'll just run with that for now because you guys, like all my audio files, the video files, all that.

@Trent [2:16:57]: Yup. It. Yeah Yeah, that Yeah, don't, don't replicate that and move that. Yeah, I think that you're, you're, you're on point there. We have inputs and outputs, right? So we have our input for our project and then our outputs as well and I think right now you're, your videos and audio files are kind of our input to to to deliver the product and I think right now what we're really looking for is just right now, we need a way to organize our outputs. What we're, what were the assets were creating for the client.

@Chris Andrade [2:17:09]: You know Yeah, yeah Right Well Right

@Chris Andrade [2:17:32]: Right Right

@Trent [2:17:39]: I think right now is the Focus.

@Chris Andrade [2:17:42]: 100%

@Trent [2:17:43]: Yeah Yeah. So if we can just find a place to put our outputs right now, we don't have all the inputs organized, but we'll do, we'll do it.

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [2:17:53]: I also wanna Citing. I also wanna, like, hopefully today in a few hours, we'll have everything. Kind of we talked about the offer and everything. I, I want to set up a meeting with an offer coaches, tell them everything we have, and then see if he has any rice or anything for us.

@Trent [2:18:08]: Yeah, good idea. Like we need to leverage resources.

@Chris Andrade [2:18:10]: Wait, what, can you repeat that? Can you, can we say that one more time?

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [2:18:14]: I was just gonna put everything we have and talked about today, and after this meeting. After I have everything packaged up and framed up, we kind of talked about the offer and how everything's gonna go. I'm just gonna relay that to the coach, see if he has any insights or any, anything he would do different.

@Chris Andrade [2:18:27]: Oh, that's a

@Matthew Kerns [2:18:28]: Have an awesome coach on the hook. Yeah.

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [2:18:31]: I don't have one scheduled, but I was gonna look right now.

@Trent [2:18:35]: Yeah, I was just curious that I, it doesn't really matter.

@Chris Andrade [2:18:37]: I, there's a, a vacation.

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [2:18:39]: I mean, I was like, why are we not, why are we not gonna.

@Trent [2:18:41]: We need to, yes, absolutely. We need, we need to leverage the resources we are paying for.

@Matthew Kerns [2:18:43]: Yeah.

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [2:18:47]: Yeah.

@Chris Andrade [2:18:48]: So this day, if you guys want to pull up your coach and see if anyone has available time before the holiday shifts.

@Trent [2:18:55]: Well, I think that there's an, is there a coach specific to offers?

@Chris Andrade [2:18:55]: But

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [2:19:00]: Yeah I just can't remember here. I mean,

@Matthew Kerns [2:19:03]: A, right? I think you talked to Aly.

@Trent [2:19:05]: Just auto

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [2:19:06]: Yeah, I

@Trent [2:19:08]: Yeah, I think Otto, he's got a lot of.

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [2:19:09]: And then kind of looked like a business coach, like you could, I guess, like Darren was an an offer coach before he was a business coach. So I kind of talked to him last time, but I never brought this certain situation to him, you know.

@Trent [2:19:21]: Oh yeah, we're we're a lot further along. Yeah.

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [2:19:22]: But I don't know what they said.

@Trent [2:19:26]: Yeah, we're a lot further along now than the probably the previous conversation that you had with him.

@Matthew Kerns [2:19:33]: Yeah

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [2:19:34]: Let me see I'm just gonna

@Chris Andrade [2:19:36]: But

@Trent [2:19:38]: Or

@Matthew Kerns [2:19:44]: His availability today apparently.

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [2:19:46]: Who there

@Matthew Kerns [2:19:48]: Auto

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [2:19:49]: Hello, yeah, like late tonight probably, right?

@Matthew Kerns [2:19:53]: Yeah, after the 55 p.m. onwards Pacific time and then again, the 14th, so Sunday, Sunday, Monday, Sunday evening, probably.

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [2:19:54]: Just Yeah, I can book, I'm gonna book a call right now.

@Matthew Kerns [2:20:05]: Yeah.

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [2:20:09]: 30 minute pause

@Matthew Kerns [2:20:10]: Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, and our calls until Wednesday, so we could Wait a little bit

@Chris Andrade [2:20:16]: OK.

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [2:20:16]: We could, we could do it on Friday or Saturday or whatever. So it doesn't have, maybe, maybe I'll book one right now just so it doesn't get full. I'll say we can do it for Sunday. Or does that give us enough time to recess? I'll say tomorrow. Why not? We can, I think we can do.

@Chris Andrade [2:20:33]: I think honestly, well from what I mean, what you're, I'll let you answer that question because you're the one that's the keyholder to that stake.

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [2:20:41]: So for me at least

@Matthew Kerns [2:20:42]: There's, there's no availability.

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [2:20:46]: OK. OK, yeah, these times are really crazy for me. It's between 12:15 a.m. and 1:30 a.m. Tonight and tomorrow night. Well, he has at 8 p.m. tonight. I could probably do that tonight. I could do 100 p.m. tonight Yeah, let's do that. 8:45 p.m. tonight.

@Chris Andrade [2:21:04]: So that's So that would be 7 p.m. my time, right?

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [2:21:08]: Yeah, you can hop on if you want.

@Chris Andrade [2:21:10]: Yeah, I would, I mean, I, oh, fuck, my son's jazz recitals tonight, Son of a gun.

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [2:21:10]: Sure Oh Don't worry, I'll shoot you guys the fireflies.

@Matthew Kerns [2:21:20]: Yeah.

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [2:21:20]: And Yeah, I'll just book a call tonight and just show them exactly what we have and how we wanna come about it, and then we'll go, I'll go from there.

@Matthew Kerns [2:21:22]: Yeah, I kind of want to

@Chris Andrade [2:21:29]: Though am I hearing this right, are you telling me that you have an outlet to run the Proposal To ultimately get a practice test run like a repin.

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [2:21:43]: It could possibly, but Auto would probably, I would just like Explain to him like I would literally just show him everything we have, show him our proposal literally and then be like, this is what we're planning to offer him. Is, does this make sense? Is this correct? And see how he would. We already have our numbers, stuff like that, and just see where

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [2:22:02]: There's gaps, I guess

@Chris Andrade [2:22:05]: OK That's exciting to hear, so we'll get feedback on what we've been working on for the past week.

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [2:22:11]: 100%

@Chris Andrade [2:22:12]: Oh Oh girl, that's cool. Like, cause that would be, I mean, I mean, I feel when I saw last night, Oh but you see you, I feel like we would have, like that's the missing.

@Chris Andrade [2:22:32]: I guess, confirmation of, of confidence that we have that I would, would, would be nice to have walking into that meeting, you know,

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [2:22:43]: Yeah, so, yeah, it's confirmed. I'll share the meeting with you guys whenever I get it. So I booked it for tonight.

@Chris Andrade [2:22:48]: I got.

@Matthew Kerns [2:22:50]: Could I just show you guys real quick before we hop off cause I did another iteration of the video, and I think it's, it's a lot better, it's just longer, so.

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [2:22:53]: Yeah. Do it That's fine. Did you, how do you stitch it together

@Matthew Kerns [2:23:03]: So I,

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [2:23:04]: What did you respond to the

@Matthew Kerns [2:23:06]: I asked Chat GBT. I fed it the master framework, so The, the one, the file that you created, Mikel, the latest, basically. And then I asked it to just create create a

@Matthew Kerns [2:23:22]: A sort 2 video generation probe that shows the vision to Kelsey and Alyssa with their dream life could look like. And then, I also included cause Chris was saying that that was one of the first things that Kelsey really wanted was the voice transcriber, so I said, let's make sure we have a voice transcriber that sits inside the office central to the flow records the audio, creates SOPs and trainings, keep the script mostly the same, but let's make sure it's incorporated in scenes where it makes sense. And then I said that to Sora too, and then, and for this latest one, I enabled like 15 seconds, which

@Matthew Kerns [2:23:58]: I don't think it goes 15 seconds, but it's just longer. And then I also added the plotter mechanic's logo, So, yeah, this is what I made. Oh, slicks on the T120 See that stirred from the middle, so it's gonna hit refresh.

@Matthew Kerns [2:24:15]: And Audio to some start come to work. We make no money. It's constant calls, parts, paperwork, all on us. There had to be a better way. Potter AI receptionist, how can I help today? In the carriage belt slips on the T-120, here's the fastest way to diagnose it. Our knowledge if I don't come to

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [2:24:37]: That's sake, OK.

@Chris Andrade [2:24:39]: There's really like, this is like shooting fish in a barrel, brow, straight up, like,

@Matthew Kerns [2:24:41]: Grow. Much

@Chris Andrade [2:24:50]: This is

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [2:24:53]: That's, that's the icing, you know what I mean? Like that's just like, hey, just really quick, I just wanna show you a quick video. This is what it could be like

@Chris Andrade [2:25:03]: Like

@Matthew Kerns [2:25:03]: Yeah That he had a red beard just from the logo though, like I didn't tell it I think.

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [2:25:10]: Probably, probably listened to our combo, but.

@Chris Andrade [2:25:12]: Yeah, no shit, huh No shit

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [2:25:15]: No, that's awesome

@Chris Andrade [2:25:17]: I just This is what I mean, like I know this is gonna work. Like I've been a part of projects before that had hesitancies and where I called my contingency factor, right? Every, everything I do as a contingency factor.

@Chris Andrade [2:25:35]: Into play My contingency factor for our group is like 2. Like I just don't see how we can fail. I really don't. I really don't

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [2:25:48]: Yeah, I also like one thing, I think we have to be prepared for is, I think we'll go with the shorter engagement, I'm pretty sure. But we also might have to be prepared for if he's down to sign a year, like a long-term engagement. What that number looks like and how that looks. And then obviously the like granted, he is our first client and like, you know, we'll definitely work with them, like, why not? Like, I think there's so much value as a case study for this guy because he's already doing good revenue. He's already, you know, so we'll definitely work with them. I don't see why not, but we should definitely be ready for both scenarios. He might be so hyped that he'll sign a year with this. Who knows.

@Matthew Kerns [2:26:05]: Yeah.

@Chris Andrade [2:26:22]: You said now you guys see why I was so excited about getting this guy in our queue right away, like, cause you see like, I saw the value of what we can bring as soon as we all have that conversation initially, and I was so excited to get

@Matthew Kerns [2:26:23]: Yeah

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [2:26:28]: Yeah. Yeah

@Chris Andrade [2:26:39]: Over there to interview him And I'm just like

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [2:26:42]: Yeah, he seems open-minded too, to like move past and so, so yeah, it's a good opportunity.

@Chris Andrade [2:26:44]: Very open-minded Very open-minded The only thing that we have to convince his wife, and how do we convince his wife? By doing what we're doing, by literally paving the way, so just visioning how it looks, not in the year. We're talking oh what next week looks like, what the week following looks like, like we're giving him a game plan of a week by week.

@Chris Andrade [2:27:13]: Input We're not like

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [2:27:15]: Honestly, I think we're giving him more than Malik gave him, and whatever, however many months he's working with them. I just think personally. That's me

@Chris Andrade [2:27:22]: And that's something that we kind of want to contest to, let's be honest, like, Cause we're gonna have to and Michael, you're gonna have to kind of be prepared for that. Is We can we do, there are, they are waiting for an analysis of what they have paid for.

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [2:27:39]: Oh, yeah, we could, we could actually even, like, I can ask Otto about that, but I can tell all like, hey, this is the position the client's in. this is the position we're currently in. This is the proposal we currently have. Is it wise to even deal with that, address that, or how should we go about that? But me personally

@Chris Andrade [2:27:49]: Hm Mhm. No, there is the client Kelsey and his wife are asking us to please tell them Like, what did I pay for

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [2:28:04]: I think, I think what would be great then, if that's what they actually want is to take After introductions, after whatever, I think we should take briefly if we don't have to do a deep diver analysis, we should highlight the, some of the key points in Malik's files and just show them, lay it out and be like, this is nothing, literally be like, OK, visually tell me that, and then show them ours, and then it's just night and day. Like that's a great opportunity. Why not? That's what they want. We'll do it. We didn't want to go that way.

@Chris Andrade [2:28:14]: I.

@Chris Andrade [2:28:33]: Or Or let's split that. Let's show them ours first and be like Like you pay for this. And then they already ran through ours and then they see what they pay for, they're like, book, you know what I'm saying?

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [2:28:48]: Either or we could talk to Trent, I can ask the a coach, see what makes sense. But I think we should.

@Chris Andrade [2:28:50]: Yeah, I I. I Yeah Point

@Matthew Kerns [2:28:54]: I'm not a salesperson, but I, I do like the other way better just because it's like a natural progression of like, OK, they paid for that, so we're going to go through that and just show them like, OK, we tried to extract, like, we tried to extract from this. We got, we were able to get like,

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [2:29:00]: You show them first Yeah, that's what makes sense to me.

@Chris Andrade [2:29:13]: Oh, I

@Matthew Kerns [2:29:14]: Maybe like a little bit.

@Chris Andrade [2:29:15]: See. I

@Matthew Kerns [2:29:17]: Maybe

@Chris Andrade [2:29:17]: Opening up with that, with them first and say, hey, we tried to use what you guys pay for.

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [2:29:19]: Yeah.

@Matthew Kerns [2:29:24]: Yeah

@Chris Andrade [2:29:25]: And that approach like that.

@Matthew Kerns [2:29:25]: Cause that showed Yeah, cause that shows like, OK, yeah, we're trying to use what before

@Chris Andrade [2:29:30]: All are, yep.

@Matthew Kerns [2:29:32]: But then we got not like we, we barely got anything and then we just did our thing.

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [2:29:36]: Hey, Trent. I know you just hopped on quickly, Chris mentioned that kind of when we do talk to Kelsey and his wife, that they're kind of expecting us to do an analysis of what Malik did, and I was like, OK, I, I, I wasn't expecting that. But if that's what they want us to do, we should almost during the presentation, go through what Malikers have highlights of what Malik, like gave them, right? Like, and do a quick synopsis of that and then go into our proposal and just show them the difference that way. That's kind of what they're expecting, and I cannot talk to Otto and see. And by the way, I booked a call with him tonight.

@Trent [2:30:09]: Oh yeah

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [2:30:14]: 8:45 p.m. I can send that out or send you guys the fireflies afterwards.

@Trent [2:30:16]: OK Yeah

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [2:30:19]: Now I was just gonna explain everything to Otto and just see what his advice would be.

@Trent [2:30:19]: Yeah Yeah, good thinking, good thinking. Yeah, it, you know, if that's an expectation on their part, it makes sense, you know, they're, they're coming They asked me like to do something.

@Trent [2:30:36]: And they understand they didn't get what they asked for, but they want to know what did we get? So then we are as the consultant

@Chris Andrade [2:30:46]: Right

@Trent [2:30:46]: Are gonna evaluate that and give them what we believe was given our evaluation of it. And then we can very quickly

@Chris Andrade [2:30:51]: Right.

@Trent [2:30:55]: Show them a contrast between what was given from Malik and what we are already getting without charging.

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [2:31:00]: Great. Great. So that should definitely tie into, that should be part of our presentation for.

@Trent [2:31:05]: Right. Agreed. I think that that is the best way to go about it. Do introductions, who we are, and then we restart it, the conversation probably off of, OK, you, your previous engagement didn't, you may not have worked out, but here's what we evaluated and this is what we came up with. This is what we see

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [2:31:14]: Yeah On our side

@Trent [2:31:25]: Yeah. And then we can move into what we think.

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [2:31:27]: And then go First. Yeah

@Trent [2:31:31]: Yeah

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [2:31:31]: Yeah. So yeah, I think, do we need to, I, I know I looked at some of the stuff that I did to be highlight anything. Is there anything that stands out that We should use? I guess if that's what they're expecting, I'd go hard, right? I, I'm gonna go in there and rip it apart like what is he talking about, you know?

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [2:31:49]: But I, I, I, I can go through it.

@Trent [2:31:49]: Yeah, yeah, respectfully so, right? We, we, you know

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [2:31:53]: Respectfully, respectful, because they paid for it at the end of the day.

@Trent [2:31:54]: Yeah, respectfully, you Yeah, at the end of the day, they paid for it. They paid $7000 and they basically got nothing. so, you know, we just objectively evaluate it and show him what we, what we believe was done, what he got, which was basically almost nothing, but we need to somehow show him that, present it somehow.

@Chris Andrade [2:31:56]: I think

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [2:32:01]: Yeah. OK.

@Chris Andrade [2:32:14]: And what makes me reiterate that is I, so I called him yesterday and just after we talked and later on, hey, we're planning this for next week if we could start coordinating a date, and he's like, oh, by the way, what did that, how did that come from Malik? Like, what did you guys get out of that? I'm like, let me let the team tell you, you know, like this is a part of our whole presentation, you know, so he's definitely anticipating that, for sure.

@Trent [2:32:44]: OK, yeah

@Matthew Kerns [2:32:44]: I have a thought about that, so I think some of those notes are from, probably from conversations that he had with Kelsey, that Malik had with Kelsey, so I'm almost a bit wary to just rip it entirely apart and be like it was entirely shit because what if some of it is Kelsey's inputs, right? So I think we should probably

@Matthew Kerns [2:33:08]: Ask like the, like

@Trent [2:33:08]: That

@Matthew Kerns [2:33:11]: What is this idea of

@Chris Andrade [2:33:11]: Maybe find for wrong

@Matthew Kerns [2:33:14]: Yeah, maybe just run through it and just go over it with Kelsey, just be like, hey, like we're not super clear from the notes. What Malik was trying to do with this, but we just want to make sure we don't lose anything that you already worked on with him from some meetings.

@Trent [2:33:29]: I love it Yes, I, I, I love it. That's probably the best angle to come at it is that the assumption that we don't have all the information, right?

@Chris Andrade [2:33:33]: Yup. Yep, and, and, and, and then we can even make it even a step further because we thought we were getting technical details and charts and stuff.

@Matthew Kerns [2:33:37]: Yeah.

@Chris Andrade [2:33:47]: But we didn't see those. We saw notes, and so before we go talking to Malik to further probe whatever we wanted just to hear your side first. And kind of see, like, can you make it sense? Like can you make sense of anything you see here? Like, is that what you're kind of ultimately trying to allude to?

@Matthew Kerns [2:34:10]: Yeah, and then see if there's anything from those notes that is like something that Kelsey's like really like, oh I want.

@Chris Andrade [2:34:17]: Oh. Oh, I remember

@Matthew Kerns [2:34:18]: I wonder if that Progress

@Chris Andrade [2:34:21]: Yeah, yeah, yeah, that makes so much sense. Makes, and again, it we're conveying that we're, we're like

@Matthew Kerns [2:34:22]: Yeah

@Chris Andrade [2:34:30]: We did our due diligence to make sure that we're trying to save as much money you already invested, you know what I'm saying? But this is what you got, dude, like.

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [2:34:37]: That's true Should, should be kind of like divide and conquer them, like I'm gonna work on like the forward facing stuff, I don't know, maybe try and go through some of the stuff that we did.

@Trent [2:34:48]: Yeah. Yeah, if you want, I'll, I'll, I'll see what Malik did. That'll, that'll be my primary thing. I need to, my to do list right now is that I have a bunch of stuff about the SOP that I created, you know, diagrams.

@Chris Andrade [2:35:02]: I'll take care of that then, Trent. I'll take me, I, I can work on the Malik stuff. And then a technical details or any technical thing that I see, I can just, I don't think we saw much of it, but I'll, I'll, I'll, I'll go through the notes and then I'll, I'll, I'll, I mean, unless Matt, if you have, if you want to take that, by all means, but I can start working on that in the meantime because I think that brings up a very valid point.

@Trent [2:35:07]: OK

@Trent [2:35:26]: Yeah Yeah, yeah, if you want to, yeah, you can go ahead and tackle that and try to see what you can come up with.

@Matthew Kerns [2:35:28]: OK. Yeah, I can help with that too

@Chris Andrade [2:35:36]: OK.

@Trent [2:35:37]: So I will If I can get just a place that I can put the details, like put the assets that I have.

@Chris Andrade [2:35:44]: Yeah.

@Trent [2:35:45]: And then we need to, yeah, so if I can just get that, that will be a big help already, so. And then, yeah, forward facing details, you know, let me know how I can help with any of that.

@Chris Andrade [2:36:00]: Will you, will you be able to set up a, a folder in your Drive me KL that we can hop on.

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [2:36:06]: Yeah Yeah, yeah. I'll set up a Rise group and then then alot mechanics and then we can just structure. I'll give you guys all access to have you guys' emails and then try, I'll probably hit you up for some of the files,

@Chris Andrade [2:36:15]: 3.

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [2:36:19]: And then, yeah

@Trent [2:36:20]: Yeah, as soon as, as soon as I have that drive, I can drop some stuff in there, so.

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [2:36:25]: Cool. And then rent, there's a new video, iteration that I showed these guys that it's only like 10 seconds long, so if you just wanted.

@Chris Andrade [2:36:34]: Oh yeah, play it real quick, show it for me.

@Trent [2:36:37]: I, I get the lengths of the links in the chat, right? Because that's a

@Chris Andrade [2:36:40]: Oh

@Trent [2:36:41]: Latest moment

@Matthew Kerns [2:36:41]: Yeah. We could do offline, yeah, it's that one.

@Trent [2:36:45]: OK

@Matthew Kerns [2:36:47]: But I just wanted to mention it cause I, I, I showed the other guys, but I don't think you saw it.

@Trent [2:36:51]: No, I didn't see it. I had to jump off. I, I actually had an appointment that I forgot I had and I just realized that I needed to reschedule it, so.

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [2:37:00]: That's what happened to me this morning.

@Chris Andrade [2:37:01]: No, sorry bro, sorry.

@Trent [2:37:04]: But lying on going through revent down here the three-wheeled layout keeps things light for Russia.

@Matthew Kerns [2:37:09]: Yeah, I've got some demo videos that I was planning to film this morning, and then I do have to get to some, some work, but I think if there's anything that that I should jump on with regards to Malik assessment, then just let me know and we can figure it out.

@Chris Andrade [2:37:31]: Yeah, so once, once, Mel sets up that link. I'm actually gonna upload those documents to the drive, and then I'll just start working on the live document, and just going, creating another deal live, so you can hop in on that set.

@Chris Andrade [2:37:50]: That main document or whatever.

@Matthew Kerns [2:37:51]: OK. OK. So

@Trent [2:37:54]: Hey Matthew, that link, I cannot get to, it does not let me Watch the video

@Matthew Kerns [2:38:01]: OK.

@Trent [2:38:02]: So

@Matthew Kerns [2:38:02]: Got it. Yeah, there was an issue with this sharing of it. Should I just show it right now?

@Trent [2:38:07]: Yeah, if you want to

@Chris Andrade [2:38:08]: Yeah OK. And does it give you like a download MP4 option?

@Matthew Kerns [2:38:13]: Let's see, I'll, I'll, So there's this Yeah, there is a download, yeah.

@Chris Andrade [2:38:22]: Oh, sweet, perfect.

@Matthew Kerns [2:38:22]: So I can. Yeah, I'll upload that to the slack.

@Chris Andrade [2:38:26]: Yeah.

@Matthew Kerns [2:38:29]: OK, but just quickly Audios on work, we make no money. It's constant. He calls, parts, paperwork, all on us. There had to be a better way. Receptionist When a carriage belt slips on the T-120, here's the fastest way to diagnose it. Our knowledge if I don't come to work

@Matthew Kerns [2:38:52]: I.

@Trent [2:38:53]: Wait.

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [2:38:53]: Let

@Trent [2:38:55]: Yeah, yeah, I like it. I like it. I think that I don't know that we really, it would be cool to put his likeness in there, but I don't think that, you know, because it's a challenge, I don't think we need to go any further.

@Chris Andrade [2:38:55]: Like No, 100% dude, like way too wait wait till he sees that. I, I can't wait to see you. I can't wait for you guys to see their expressions. Like I know it's gonna be a big one, so.

@Trent [2:39:17]: Yeah Yeah, yeah. It's awesome Yeah, keep up the good work, guys. I mean, we're, we're

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [2:39:22]: Like agenda or

@Chris Andrade [2:39:25]: OK.

@Trent [2:39:26]: Yeah, we are

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [2:39:26]: I say I'm mistake

@Trent [2:39:28]: Good

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [2:39:29]: I'm sorry, go ahead

@Trent [2:39:31]: I was just gonna say we're killers, man. I don't know what we're doing right now that makes it magic, but some, some stuff is happening here, brothers, like we're, we're really pulling some stuff out of the woodwork that I don't think I even expected we could do, to be honest.

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [2:39:41]: Literally To have

@Chris Andrade [2:39:48]: Do you guys, do you guys know that we actually made this arrangement. I started the group on the 23rd, right? I met Matthew on the 24th. Met everybody else on the 25th. I've been journaling about this, by the way, and then with so honestly, we didn't really finalize our details to the second.

@Chris Andrade [2:40:13]: Right? And that's when we really found that we could really trust each other and lean on each other, and if we didn't really start getting to work till the 4th.

@Trent [2:40:25]: And we're only, what is that? 6, 73, 7 days, yeah.

@Chris Andrade [2:40:25]: Right? 7 days 7 days, guys 7 days in all reality.

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [2:40:33]: And this is while we're, while we're learning how to do it.

@Chris Andrade [2:40:36]: Monday, excuse me

@Trent [2:40:37]: Yep He was just saying, we are learning along the way. So we took 7 days to get where we are, putting together Ourselves, right? Learning it as we go and we've accomplished a lot in just 7 days.

@Matthew Kerns [2:40:39]: While we're learning how to

@Chris Andrade [2:40:48]: Right. So Really like, like, let's let's just go through this. We did our first initial interview. We created our our our onboarding process You guys created the website, we created the Matrix, we created the opportunities on how we're going to deliver. We pretty much as of right now figured out how it's delivering, how we're gonna deliver it, and then the way it's gonna look like when we deliver it, and we're gonna have it delivered in another 7 days. Well, 6 days. So all this, all like we literally started our first company, client, and possibly close within

@Trent [2:41:33]: 2 weeks.

@Chris Andrade [2:41:33]: 13 days

@Trent [2:41:34]: Yeah. Yeah.

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [2:41:37]: I was like, that's, that sounds like a Sounds like a serious sounds like I can't wait.

@Chris Andrade [2:41:41]: It sounds like a really good post on our circle group.

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [2:41:45]: We have, we have good documentation too. we, we have great documentation too, so that's good to know.

@Trent [2:41:46]: Yeah, that's right

@Chris Andrade [2:41:48]: Yep. Yeah Yeah

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [2:41:53]: Just talking about the journey.

@Chris Andrade [2:41:54]: So

@Matthew Kerns [2:41:56]: I kind of think like we got 6 whole days until we meet with them. Like, I, I think we're gonna be more than ready before then and Maybe I just want to float the idea of like potentially feeding another company through the processes that we've created and just see what we can come up with for another one, but I don't want to distract us from the main focus. So maybe we can just even pushing far.

@Trent [2:42:19]: Yeah

@Chris Andrade [2:42:20]: So that's why I was up late last night, Matt, because you and I talked a little bit about the, do you guys know what a rotary motor is

@Trent [2:42:29]: Yeah

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [2:42:29]: Is it on a boat

@Chris Andrade [2:42:31]: No, it's, it's a type of engine, rotary rotary motors that you can literally add engines on the engines with the rotary motor, and it's a triangle, right? And what the, the way it works is when fire

@Matthew Kerns [2:42:31]: In a

@Trent [2:42:33]: Mai 7 Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah

@Chris Andrade [2:42:48]: Compression, intake, right? And each one as it revolves around its rotary, it, it, it's the other one makes the other initiate. That one initiates the other movement, right?

@Trent [2:42:59]: Yeah Yup.

@Chris Andrade [2:43:01]: And, in order, like we have plotter mechanics, we have, honestly, either However way we choose, Remus development, we have that full environment, all of the financials, the information, the everything ready to go, and S&S woolsheds.

@Chris Andrade [2:43:23]: How do we know what she wants to do? And I think that's where me and you, Mike out, that's why I'm trying to, I worked up really late last night to try to ultimately start organizing all my documentation for all the other people we have, and you create some sort of list of all these tools that we need.

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [2:43:36]: Mhm

@Chris Andrade [2:43:44]: And I don't know, and it's just how

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [2:43:47]: No, I agree. I think 100% we have options on the table right now, and then also that ties into After we get tired at loose ends on this, Matthew, I definitely want to go through this whole process again. We could like maybe even by this we can spin that through your business and then also Chris, like come up with like a way to evaluate

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [2:44:06]: Opportunities because at the end of the day, I think we should almost be exclusive because it's like, especially now we're beginning, we should almost be like, hey, we're only taking X amount of clients this month and we're going to be selective about how we, so if when we hop on like an opportunity call we should almost be interviewing them and not the other way around, you know, and just be like, hey, we, and then we'll have truth. We'll have proof based off our past projects and be like this we could show you this, like this is what we're doing. So I think it's a good strategy.

@Chris Andrade [2:44:25]: And I don't And I really honestly happened in real time yesterday. I don't know if you caught that from me, but I was supposed to go fly a drone mission yesterday from this new client that hit me up all excited about what we're doing, and we all need to build an app. I need to do this. You, I've been looking at, I got me all fired up, right? So then I was ready to drop everything I was gonna do to go fly this mission to get this client, right?

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [2:44:41]: Mhm.

@Chris Andrade [2:44:56]: He didn't call me like the next day and then send me a text, and like, here it is 2 hours away from launch, and I still don't have any information. I text him like, I can't operate like this, dude. You know, and, and ultimately, now I feel like I have the power to choose.

@Chris Andrade [2:45:14]: Who or what I'm, who am I spending my time with? Like, who am I gonna get the most out of. I want the smaller time that I got right now, because you ain't paying me.

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [2:45:24]: Especially now Yeah, especially where we're at. OK, I feel like that's something to think about.

@Chris Andrade [2:45:25]: Right. Right And so that what you just said is the qualifications is kind of important because ultimately we need to be able to see what out of all of these wins that I got just floating over my head right now. Which one can I look like transit low hanging ones.

@Chris Andrade [2:45:44]: So I can just snapchat.

@Matthew Kerns [2:45:44]: Yeah So definitely ones where we don't have any documents are farther out of reach than ones where we do have documentation. Anyone that we have documentation and a bunch of documents for, like, where like one of my clients, I'm just waiting on documentation and it's like annoying, so anyone that we have documentation, we can feed through our processes. We can feed through our process mapping structures, and we can essentially put together, so how we do an opportunity

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [2:45:46]: Yeah.

@Chris Andrade [2:45:57]: Then that would

@Matthew Kerns [2:46:16]: Matrix for each company, we can do an opportunity matrix across multiple companies to prioritize our efforts.

@Chris Andrade [2:46:23]: Leads a lot.

@Trent [2:46:24]: You know, yes, we need our own opportunity matrix for the companies themselves and maybe, maybe for overlapping solutions, like, OK, so there's an, there's an opportunity matrix for each company, right? Then some of those opportunities inside of the company overlap with other companies, so we need to also have that, right?

@Chris Andrade [2:46:29]: Right

@Matthew Kerns [2:46:36]: Yeah

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [2:46:44]: Over that

@Matthew Kerns [2:46:47]: Yeah

@Chris Andrade [2:46:49]: So great, like I always say that.

@Matthew Kerns [2:46:49]: So like one company ROI

@Chris Andrade [2:46:52]: Sorry, go ahead

@Matthew Kerns [2:46:52]: Yeah. Yeah, I was, I was literally probably gonna say the same thing you're gonna say, like, the voice agent might have a particular ROI for one company, and then if, if we find a pattern, especially in the same niche, right? If they're, all these are in construction niche, so there's gonna be probably a couple of solutions that are highest ROI, and then we just nail into those solutions and maybe instead of maybe we focus

@Chris Andrade [2:46:55]: Yeah Yes Yeah

@Matthew Kerns [2:47:17]: We'll have to see what's the higher ROI if we focus on a whole company or if we deliver one solution at a time across the three companies. I don't know what is gonna be better for execution.

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [2:47:27]: I mean

@Trent [2:47:29]: Well, I, I think that for scale, like the way you scale in a business is really to productize, right? You take the same process or the same product, which can be your process. And you apply it across many, because it's repeatable and you've you refining it and making it more efficient, and it's something that you test battle tested, so I think that, you know, if we can at a minimum, take the process.

@Trent [2:48:00]: And productize it. That's what we're doing right now actually is we're building our processes For every opportunity or every business, and then we have a voice agent that works well across many industries, then we try to push into the ones that are the most

@Chris Andrade [2:48:08]: So can you

@Trent [2:48:17]: ROI I guess Really, right

@Chris Andrade [2:48:20]: So can I make a suggestion here?

@Trent [2:48:21]: Bru. Yeah.

@Chris Andrade [2:48:25]: With what Matthew just said in Trent, you just said, I think me and MiL can create a really good overflow. Chart Of the clients, the opportunities, the, the what we need, right? And then she put build a matrix and see how many of these potential clients need this one aspect, this one tool.

@Chris Andrade [2:48:53]: And maybe make that determination from them. But right now, as I see fit, SNS and woolsheds, we already have all the documentation we need. We know regardless, the main component to that, to make that function work is the hyperlink system.

@Chris Andrade [2:49:11]: Right? Can we start working on like, like can we start figuring out that hyperlink system because that's hon honestly the only thing really to stop us from rolling out into their live environment.

@Matthew Kerns [2:49:24]: Yeah Dude, OK. So I have literally, for my company, I'm on my demo video list is a system where, I wonder if I have one right here. There's a QR code link on the insert card, for my company that goes out with every product and recently we did a scratch and win thing, so you, you scratch off for for that company, and then you get a QR code and basically the customer scans the QR code

@Matthew Kerns [2:49:55]: And they land on my website that I created with cloud code, so to migrate away from Shopify, which I'm still considering going back, honestly, but basically it's a custom-made website that there's a flow that I have set up that's just like they spin a wheel, they like to get their prize, right, and then in order to proceed, they, they have to sign up for an account.

@Matthew Kerns [2:50:24]: So they have to sign up for an account and then they have to put in their order ID and then once they do those things, there's an automation that checks the order ID and then basically they'll get shown their discount code link, so it's a very simple flow. There's just like 3 steps, but it includes account creation, QR code, link to the website and

@Matthew Kerns [2:50:47]: A custom flow. So there's already that infrastructure at least built.

@Trent [2:50:52]: Once you, yeah, once you have the, the QR code to get to where you want. It's a matter of just walking the

@Matthew Kerns [2:50:52]: So

@Chris Andrade [2:50:55]: It

@Trent [2:51:01]: Whoever scanned the QR code through the the workflow, right, the funnel.

@Chris Andrade [2:51:06]: And that's also plotter mechanics' system that they need, because their inventory is just boxes and we can put a hyperlink on each box, or shelf or tray on that shelf, ultimately creating their inventory management, then obviously knowing what boxes where on what shelf, so we have to create a

@Trent [2:51:06]: OK.

@Chris Andrade [2:51:32]: What's the method for file systems in computers.

@Matthew Kerns [2:51:40]: Directory structure, folder structure.

@Chris Andrade [2:51:42]: Yeah, something that in effect, but it's like a a a directory of their like, then that's why I took that 3D model, cause now we know where the shelves live, how many shelves there are, where, you know, we're approximately in the office there is, and then so you guys can visually see that they have 5 shells

@Chris Andrade [2:52:01]: 123 on the left side, 456 are on the right side, where we can actually name them conventionally, and then so water mechanics needs that same thing regardless too. So it's the same theory if you could figure that out right now, you're technically figuring out two companies deliverables at the same time, that we know of right now.

@Trent [2:52:22]: That's what we're Yeah, that's what we're, that's what I think we're looking to do is to find overlap, right? So the ven like the Venn diagram type of situation where, you know, the solutions overlap in some way that we were working on multiple projects or multiple opportunities at the same time, but only doing it with one

@Matthew Kerns [2:52:25]: Period.

@Trent [2:52:41]: Iteration of effort, like one pass of effort, so.

@Chris Andrade [2:52:46]: Yep Yep

@Trent [2:52:47]: Or 80/20, right? 80% of it is shared between the two and the 20% is customized.

@Chris Andrade [2:52:53]: So I think what may hold, I, I think after we have our coaching call that Mike is gonna have tonight. We go over that tomorrow, right? So, which would be Friday, right? And maybe weschedule. I wanted to release the workbook one for the shed dealership, maybe Wednesday night after our meeting with Kelsey, but I think that might be too long. Maybe we do that like on a Friday night or Saturday night.

@Chris Andrade [2:53:24]: Where we have, like for me it's like this is my launch party, right? I wanna, I would love to have a launch party with you guys on a Friday, Saturday night, so so I can introduce to you guys the workbook one project.

@Trent [2:53:39]: Yeah, yeah If you guys are available. And then from there you can see all of the documentation

@Matthew Kerns [2:53:43]: Yep.

@Chris Andrade [2:53:47]: To support your tools that is needed that could possibly waterfall into other projects that could potentially be capitalized on For plug and play options.

@Trent [2:54:03]: Yup.

@Matthew Kerns [2:54:03]: Why don't we, like, I'm imagining like, you can just like for any new company, I know these are, we, we should probably treat these first ones with more care, but in the future, like, we can literally just have a, a channel created in Slack, where all the documentation, maybe the folder for the documentation gets uploaded.

@Matthew Kerns [2:54:27]: And then like Anytime any of us want to pick one up, we can just run it through our process. That company and just do an assessment. And then That way there's like, kind of like a queue of potential opportunities, and then we can like cause we're going to have a process once we create it for the opportunity matrix across companies. So if we just have an easy way to

@Trent [2:54:57]: The pipelines

@Matthew Kerns [2:54:57]: Have access to the dietitian, then it's a pipeline, yeah.

@Trent [2:55:01]: The, the sales pipeline, I think is probably like a good channel right now, that would, that would fit into, And you can fit, I think you can do

@Chris Andrade [2:55:08]: You guys take my string

@Trent [2:55:12]: Swim lanes Like a canban style board on a canvas. I think

@Chris Andrade [2:55:20]: So like You see, you guys see my screen?

@Trent [2:55:23]: Yeah

@Chris Andrade [2:55:24]: So you see how I have these folders.

@Trent [2:55:27]: Yeah

@Chris Andrade [2:55:27]: Each one of these folders See all these files

@Trent [2:55:31]: Yeah

@Chris Andrade [2:55:32]: These are all recordings from potential clients. Now I have to go through Every, like I gotta literally figure out how to go through these, like, this is just from December. This is just from since we started the program, and now I had to start organizing my my names.

@Chris Andrade [2:55:54]: Right? And, and, and, and Like This is, I had to start organizing it because with what we've noticed with plotter mechanics is that once you were able to not only just see the transcript, is one thing, but when you could hear it,

@Chris Andrade [2:56:12]: Is another, or you see something on the transcript, but you maybe want some more context to it. So then you have the audio file and the time stamp to go to that, right? I, now I just gotta figure out what you just said. The client, I, I, all these, so like, for instance, so Dave is towards one project, so when I said I had 10 different clients. I mean, I think I meant I attended for projects that I touched on yesterday, right? So this is Reuss, this was John Sanders, dude, this, this is called right here.

@Matthew Kerns [2:56:44]: Yeah

@Chris Andrade [2:56:50]: Nathan, again, another one that this is all about construction stuff. This is what I mean by I'm overwhelmed with how much input I have to go through, you know.

@Matthew Kerns [2:56:58]: So Yeah. So we work that has to be done manually is organization of Like these files, and like, so running it through a process and determining the opportunity, there, there's a, we feed the transcripts. We can feed the transcripts through cloud code and do some stuff pretty instantly. But processing the audio files takes time.

@Trent [2:57:32]: Well, let me, I was just

@Matthew Kerns [2:57:32]: And also manually going through the audio files, right? We'll take, will be the big like there.

@Trent [2:57:34]: What Yeah, so So I was brainstorming just now, right, while we were Sorry, I, forgive me, I have to take this phone call real quick.

@Chris Andrade [2:57:46]: Yeah, oh, I'm gonna use the restroom real quick. I'll be right back.

@Matthew Kerns [2:57:47]: For OK. Maybe I'll get water enough.

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [2:58:05]: I shared those files, the, the, the driver, the yes. It's not whatever files or whatever.

@Trent [2:58:17]: OK, OK, I'm back. So what I was saying, before the doctor's office rudely interrupted us. They, that I was brainstorming on this Audio file situation. He's got all these audio files.

@Trent [2:58:35]: So, is there a way that we can run a local processing to transcribe these Well, like And then If we can literally take these and transcribe them.

@Trent [2:58:51]: He doesn't need to organize them Or even rename them. Himself If we can transcribe them, it could literally take the information from the transcription. To put them in some organization.

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [2:59:07]: Yeah.

@Trent [2:59:07]: Let's name them

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [2:59:08]: I think. I think Matthew did it away. I'm not sure how he did it. He just stepped away for a sec, but, There is a way to do that. He, he got the transcripts from the Google Drive and then fed it through the cloud awash.

@Trent [2:59:21]: Yeah, so what I'm, what I'm brainstorming on this for our process and our automation in the future, a vision that I have is that we have a web page or a web portal or a something like this that that works through our automated process where we have a recording, we put the recording on the web portal, and it will take that file and transcribe it and then automatically do what it needs to for from there, like an automated sequence of events.

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [2:59:32]: Yeah Cigar.

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [2:59:52]: Yeah. So we, we

@Trent [2:59:52]: That It Yeah.

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [2:59:54]: We, we, I think, Matthew, we, we talked about it and the way Is like, it would have to be user based, so there needs to be like a user-based login once they do and then they go in, they either chat with like some kind of interface or agent or whatever dump in the files and then

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [3:00:12]: Process flow and gives those maps and drawings and whatever spits out whatever we needed to.

@Trent [3:00:18]: Yeah, yeah, exactly

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [3:00:18]: Once we build our processes, our in test and validate.

@Trent [3:00:22]: Yes, exactly. Something like that.

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [3:00:23]: That makes sense. I think the best way to do that is through the website, right?

@Trent [3:00:27]: Like through, like we, well, from a from a user like an end user perspective, definitely is gonna be one of the best ways to do it. I was thinking, like, for internal, like our internal processes, you know, trying to build a system that

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [3:00:27]: Like the like a

@Trent [3:00:44]: You know, we're, we're talking about some of the problems we have, which are file organization Processing audio files or video files to make transcriptions, tends to be a little bit of a lengthy and manual process in in some ways. So In the organization side of things, but if you could take the file and you could put it into a portal, either an AI chat or just an upload link, like you just drop the file into it like you do Google Drive.

@Trent [3:01:11]: And it sets off a workflow that what it does is it transcribes it, it organizes it, pulls out the details of the client.

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [3:01:23]: Put it through our processes.

@Trent [3:01:24]: And, and sort of like links things together, like it, it daisy chains our process that we're currently building.

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [3:01:30]: Mhm

@Chris Andrade [3:01:31]: If my plan is like moving forward to help limit opportunities lost from my end and I installed fireflies on my tablet that sits on my desk, so I'm on my phone call, I have to like, cause I always talk on my earpiece.

@Trent [3:01:38]: Yes.

@Chris Andrade [3:01:51]: Now I'm having those conversations in speaker. While my iPad is running fireflies recording that conversation. That's what I'm gonna start doing, moving forward, it's like

@Trent [3:02:04]: Yes, if we can, if we can transcribe live using tools like what you're doing right there. It saves us that step of an audio, right?

@Chris Andrade [3:02:10]: Right It's just, I, now I have like, dude, this is just since I started PMG I got audio files from

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [3:02:13]: While we're building. Sense

@Chris Andrade [3:02:22]: Like detailed construction notes, like conversations with inspectors, conversations with builders, like Other subcontractors, like so much information just sitting in this drive that now knowing like that's kind of gold.

@Chris Andrade [3:02:45]: Because we can use that as a, as our own database to reference things on in construction or whatever category, right? And so I'm like, like I'm almost tempted to literally buy another computer and just dedicate that computer to our business, our consulting, and then whatever gets onto that computer is structured the way it needs to be structured, cause

@Chris Andrade [3:03:13]: I have So 5 years' worth of businesses on this one computer and it's just so mixed.

@Trent [3:03:22]: Yeah, so this This process I kind of talked about of like audio files and parsing them. I get that we can shortcut that by using fireflies or a tool that can record and transcribe for us, but if I were to come back to the thing that I was talking about previously with having a way to just have a little device that you wear on your person, and record things, it, it kind of

@Chris Andrade [3:03:47]: Yep. Yeah.

@Trent [3:03:52]: Having the ability to be able to take an audio file and transcribe it It Works with that too, like it's a piece of the puzzle. So

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [3:04:01]: Isn't that the device that you shared, like something that you do?

@Trent [3:04:05]: It, it does kind of what we want it to do. It does do that, but the biggest thing that I think we'll run into is the subscription fees that are required for it. Are like the the entry level is like

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [3:04:16]: Makes sense

@Trent [3:04:20]: What was it? I wanna say it was like $5 or $10 a month, but you only got like 100 minutes of

@Chris Andrade [3:04:26]: Yeah, it was gonna cost me $99 a month, like $99 was it a 9 month or a year. I forgot which one it was.

@Trent [3:04:33]: No, it was, it was actually kind of expensive as you go up to like the unlimited plan where you can store as much transcription as you want.

@Chris Andrade [3:04:36]: Right. So

@Trent [3:04:41]: I like it. I really like it. I do, but I think that's gonna be a limiting factor for us.

@Chris Andrade [3:04:47]: And so we

@Trent [3:04:47]: Other ways around it though.

@Chris Andrade [3:04:48]: Me and Mika, real quick, we were talking about my solution because I was actually going to purchase that plot. But then I saw how much, like how it integrated and how much you have to pay for it, right? So my, my, my, what I did to salute that was I bought my DJI, right? Mike, I have two of them. It's the mic 2, right? And this is the receiver

@Chris Andrade [3:05:14]: That has not only USBC, but then I can also plug in an old, like there's this adapter, right, that is, I think that's Thunderbolt, that

@Trent [3:05:14]: Yeah

@Chris Andrade [3:05:27]: If there was a way to, I, I can connect this to my cell phone, right? But the problem is then my cell phone, in order to run fireflies, it enable disables the microphone or the phone because now it's running the app.

@Chris Andrade [3:05:46]: So then I have to have a secondary app to run it. My question would be, is like, is there a way that we can plug this transponder or receiver into our own device. To connect the mic to our app.

@Trent [3:06:00]: Yeah, that, that's precisely what I was trying to solve that problem. We haven't, now, what Matthew has brought up is that his background is creating mobile applications like Android applications for Amazon, and

@Chris Andrade [3:06:01]: I Right

@Trent [3:06:18]: I mean, he's like, hey, if you wanna, you know, let's like come up with an idea here. Maybe we have something that we can put together using a mobile app that can use a microphone To do what we wanted to do.

@Chris Andrade [3:06:33]: Yeah, cause we already know Kelsey pushes a button and records his voice to a text or writing.

@Trent [3:06:40]: Well, yeah, that's what we need him to do, but we need him to do that, send it through our, our system so that we can do, we can work our magic, right?

@Chris Andrade [3:06:49]: And then and then if that all it takes is like math spending maybe that's what we do. It's like man I think might be spending good time to build out what our user interface would look like. To be able to transact.

@Matthew Kerns [3:07:01]: So I would, yeah. And, but I would prefer That we start, we try out, well, what do you guys think about this? Like, cause There's different phone types, right? There's iPhone and there's Android, so if we go the native app route, we have to solve for both platforms every time we do anything, so there's another alternative which is that we just create a web app, so they just pull up the URL and then as long as there's not any practical issues, like I don't know if for example, one thing that I could

@Chris Andrade [3:07:18]: And

@Trent [3:07:31]: Yeah.

@Matthew Kerns [3:07:40]: Think about or foresee potentially happening is when you have a web app open, does your phone just lock on you when it thinks that you're not using it, like, and then with that close the audio transcription, or could it run anyways, like, it happens to me when I use the Circle app,

@Trent [3:07:58]: Indefinitely

@Matthew Kerns [3:08:02]: I think there must be a way through it because the circle app, like I, I can record a voice message and WhatsApp also I can record a voice message and then like I can go to other apps or my phone darkens and it's still recording, and I just have to open it again, so I think there's a

@Trent [3:08:20]: Yeah, so those are native apps though, right? They're not, they're not web apps, right? So the que the question really comes, can we solve the problem through a web app or does it have to be a native app, right? So, but you can do what they call those progressive web is it progressive web apps or whatever where you can install it in a way you install it on your phone, but it's still just web.

@Matthew Kerns [3:08:25]: Yeah Yeah Yeah. Yeah Yeah

@Trent [3:08:43]: Like it's still a web-based app, but it's An icon that goes on your home screen that you can click like an app.

@Matthew Kerns [3:08:47]: Yeah But does that make it

@Trent [3:08:53]: No

@Matthew Kerns [3:08:53]: Native, or did it give you native capabilities.

@Trent [3:08:55]: It just wraps it differently. It still opens it opens it in a browser that's like minimized, doesn't have all the UI features of a normal browser, but it's still the web page like as if you went to safari and you Open it up.

@Matthew Kerns [3:09:09]: Yeah Well, if we just have

@Trent [3:09:11]: That's my understanding

@Matthew Kerns [3:09:13]: Yeah. So if we just have one problem that's like we just need audio recorded through our system. We can find a way to do it. It's just, that's my first question. These are the questions, and then it's like, OK, you native like, who are we building it for? Is it do we want Kelsey to be our first one and what phone does he have? Does he have an iPhone or an Android?

@Trent [3:09:24]: The engineering chance Yup.

@Chris Andrade [3:09:36]: He has an iPhone

@Trent [3:09:38]: Wow.

@Chris Andrade [3:09:38]: But Yeah, I mean, I, I got, I got, I got 4 Android devices just sitting in a drawer that I can just I know, I, I don't know about, is it called kerneling, kernel kernel. Where you can Rewrite the operating system on the phone.

@Trent [3:09:57]: Yeah, I mean, we don't really, I mean, we would just, so you can debug like Matthew knows this, you can write an application without having a physical device and test it and all that. So, but the trickiest part next would be actually testing it on hardware to make sure that it does function. So if he might already have the hardware that he needs. If he doesn't have it, then you sound like you might have something, and then it's a matter of just getting it into the developer mode or the debug modes to be able to, you know, do what he needs to do.

@Chris Andrade [3:10:27]: Right.

@Matthew Kerns [3:10:27]: Yeah I have my iPhone and I have, I have some leftover Android devices from Amazon that I probably should have sent back to them, but still have them.

@Trent [3:10:37]: Yeah, you'll have that Yeah, you'll have that. I have a whole basement full of electronics that are from Omeron, so I need to, I need to sell some of them.

@Matthew Kerns [3:10:44]: Yeah, they didn't even, they like. Yeah, didn't even ask for him or anything, but

@Trent [3:10:51]: Yeah, but anyway, so yeah, we got lots of cool ideas of things that we can build. I think that, you know, the key here is let's solve a problem for an opportunity or a client, and where it fits in and makes sense, we spend time and effort on it, right? So

@Matthew Kerns [3:11:07]: Yes, yeah.

@Trent [3:11:07]: That's

@Matthew Kerns [3:11:09]: And the highest ROI thing because we just want to go build everything, but you know

@Chris Andrade [3:11:14]: Right

@Matthew Kerns [3:11:15]: Yeah.

@Trent [3:11:15]: Yes, we do

@Matthew Kerns [3:11:16]: Yeah, the first step is, OK, what's the highest ROI thing, once we figure that out, then it's like, OK, now we just build and then we actually get rewarded for it.

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [3:11:29]: 100%. I think it's also like, once we close the slaughter mechanics, like we could shift gears, like you and me could shift gears on our next target and start building an acquisition for that like a plan for that and then just go that way, you know. We, we, I think I like how we work together to attack a certain client.

@Chris Andrade [3:11:37]: Yes

@Trent [3:11:43]: Bingo

@Chris Andrade [3:11:45]: For that because Oh sorry

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [3:11:50]: And

@Chris Andrade [3:11:51]: I, I just said I can't wait for

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [3:11:52]: I was just just Telling you

@Chris Andrade [3:11:56]: There's

@Trent [3:11:57]: Breakup on your audio there, Miguel.

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [3:11:58]: The more Oh sorry

@Chris Andrade [3:12:05]: I you say I can't wait for that to be honest, because I've been waiting to jump on you with this just because I know you're gonna help me. See things a little bit more clearer. But yeah I

@Trent [3:12:16]: By this first one and then Matthew and I can really start tackling it however we choose to do that, right? we can start tackling the technical aspect and the delivery while you guys are working on massaging the next

@Chris Andrade [3:12:22]: Right

@Trent [3:12:30]: Opportunities, so that we can deliver You know, hopefully like right behind or even potentially in parallel with plotter mechanics.

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [3:12:34]: Yeah

@Trent [3:12:40]: Yeah, and, I think that's why I want to have that release, maybe earlier than I anticipated for wolfsh sheds for the wolforkbook wine because I really want you guys, like, this is the whole reason why I'm here, right? I am now obviously we shifted gears because this team just kind of became precedents to me.

@Chris Andrade [3:13:00]: But at the end of the day, we have another client just sitting there waiting for us. That can make us money as soon as we put it live, like legit. So, I, I think we need to use wolf sheds as our client #2 for sure.

@Chris Andrade [3:13:21]: And let's start, cause this is a whole other type of client. This client needs an app. This client needs a CRM and integrations, iterations, installs, like, like this is like It could be, this is at $50,000 80,000 dollars client.

@Chris Andrade [3:13:40]: That we have a runway on, you know.

@Trent [3:13:42]: Yeah And, and, well, that's so, that's where plotter mechanics kind of is sort of key to our plan here is that if we can just get some revenue from from plotter mechanics. It gives us a little bit of flexibility to, to consider other

@Trent [3:13:58]: You know, other avenues that we can work on in parallel, and try to set up for the next, the next opportunity. So

@Chris Andrade [3:14:05]: And, and that's the and at the end of the day and that's why I wanna have that release party, so if we can have, if you guys, I don't know what your schedule is Friday night or Saturday night, I, I, I, I would love to kind of, you know, spend maybe like 30 minutes, maybe an hour, just to, just to show you guys the workbook, and then and then I would, I just love just to see your guidance's first reactions, if I mean,

@Trent [3:14:32]: Do you want this, this Friday?

@Chris Andrade [3:14:34]: Or Saturday, yeah.

@Trent [3:14:37]: Saturday

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [3:14:37]: Yeah, that's right. About

@Trent [3:14:39]: Saturday night, maybe like later-ish.

@Chris Andrade [3:14:44]: And if it doesn't work, it don't work, you know what I mean? Like you don't, I mean, tonight is my son's jazz concert, so me and my lady are actually getting a night out on the town. I'm gonna watch my son play some jazz with his group, and then then tomorrow night I'll be pretty much back in, you know, in the office, so.

@Trent [3:14:44]: I know Nice

@Trent [3:15:06]: Yeah.

@Matthew Kerns [3:15:06]: Tomorrow night would be good for me. Saturday night is questionable. Saturday morning I could

@Trent [3:15:07]: OK. Yeah.

@Chris Andrade [3:15:14]: OK

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [3:15:14]: OK

@Trent [3:15:15]: Where I'm at with Saturday as well is that it's kind of questionable in the evening, Friday is a better

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [3:15:18]: Bye bye

@Chris Andrade [3:15:22]: If you need Saturday Saturday morning works, I can do Saturday morning. I'm not stuck tonight.

@Trent [3:15:27]: Well, it depends on like what time we're talking about in the morning. I mean, you know, if we're talking about what we would normally doing. Probably I got a basketball game to go to 9:30 Eastern time, so, I probably have to leave earlier

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [3:15:42]: I'm really every day. We could, we could do

@Trent [3:15:43]: Probably at 9

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [3:15:44]: We could do whatever. whenever you guys are available, like Friday, Saturday, it doesn't matter to me.

@Trent [3:15:51]: OK.

@Chris Andrade [3:15:52]: Yeah

@Matthew Kerns [3:15:53]: I can be available

@Chris Andrade [3:15:54]: But you just let me know when you are available like we, are we, are we putting those meetings in a in our meeting chat in Slack.

@Matthew Kerns [3:15:54]: Just not for her.

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [3:16:03]: Yeah, we could, we could, we could spin up a Well, I forgot the company name, but yeah, we could spin up the channel for you and then like yeah.

@Chris Andrade [3:16:13]: OK

@Matthew Kerns [3:16:13]: I liked the the calendly scheduling thing that Trent did with like, where all of us.

@Chris Andrade [3:16:19]: I do own

@Matthew Kerns [3:16:21]: Yeah

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [3:16:21]: But I don't see that guy.

@Trent [3:16:23]: What's that

@Chris Andrade [3:16:24]: The

@Matthew Kerns [3:16:24]: You did this thing that was like meeting set up. I think it was through Calendly where it's like,

@Chris Andrade [3:16:28]: There was, you were a pole where we took a poll on what times were

@Trent [3:16:32]: Oh yeah Yeah, yeah, the pole, yeah, so you can use if you're, I think you might have to pay for Calendly. I don't know if it does with the free one, but yeah, you can do a meeting poll. ultimately, it doesn't schedule it. What it does is it comes back and tells me the results, and then I have to pick the time.

@Matthew Kerns [3:16:50]: OK, got it.

@Trent [3:16:50]: So if you want, I can send another one out or

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [3:16:54]: Yeah, I don't.

@Trent [3:16:55]: I think we can do that

@Matthew Kerns [3:16:57]: And then Mika, we, me and you, me and you should do that for with Katrina too, so we follow up with her cause I don't want to leave her hanging.

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [3:17:04]: Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, I completely. Yep, so we'll, we'll set that up.

@Chris Andrade [3:17:07]: I've been meaning to introduction for, by the way. I just haven't had a moment

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [3:17:11]: Yeah.

@Matthew Kerns [3:17:13]: Let me see if you can join

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [3:17:13]: I think we, we're supposed to set up a meeting with her. I completely forgot about that channel. I'm not gonna lie. We can, I'll set that up with her today. What works for you? We can hop up online, it doesn't matter. But Chris, we can invite you to that meeting too, or like can everyone doesn't really matter.

@Chris Andrade [3:17:25]: Yeah, I mean, I just I just would love to meet her, honestly, I, I had a conversations in our networking group. I just never got to meet her, but yeah, if you got

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [3:17:35]: I don't see why not

@Chris Andrade [3:17:36]: Yeah, I, if you guys are open and I'll be, I'm pretty much this is what I'm doing all day, so.

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [3:17:37]: We Yeah, OK, then maybe we need to, we can ask Katrina for her time and Maybe we all just meet her as a group to show her what we're working on and then see if If we can get some ideas or see how we could maybe collaborate or whatever, you know.

@Matthew Kerns [3:17:55]: Yeah, cause I know she needs the whoopers. She needs people to build stuff, cause she's she's got her funnel of attracting leads, so,

@Chris Andrade [3:17:57]: Go She actually talked about that during Tuesday's meeting. Apparently she did a huge unlock. She's focusing in on, yeah, the SOPs, right? And really making sure that these companies have the foundations that are needed to expand the way they are. And that

@Trent [3:18:25]: Well, son of a gun I mean, right there's another, you know, use case for what we're working on for Plotter mechanics.

@Chris Andrade [3:18:32]: Yep.

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [3:18:32]: Exactly.

@Chris Andrade [3:18:33]: Yep Yep, and I think that's where she's really niching in down on because I think that's a specialty. So overall, I, I, I just love her personality and how she carries herself. Like, I think she

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [3:18:44]: We should just introduce ourselves to her, like as a group and just be like, hey, and then just show her whatever, like, we'll just work out our time and then We'll figure that out

@Chris Andrade [3:18:53]: And then just on the second I height because you're touching on that, I got Chiporrison. He is, a quality engineer for oil and gas company. And he's using clo code to generate his company, gave him an initiative to use AI and to see what he can do to save money.

@Chris Andrade [3:19:15]: He can't really talk about what he's doing because it's all, it's in the gas and oil sector, you know how them are, but he is, he's a mentor of mine, and he's curious, he just wants to meet you guys, and he has, he's been working in there's a lot of debugging things that he's been exposing in cloudcoat that he ultimately wanted to share with you guys about his findings and his experience with developing apps in cloud, and then maybe help

@Chris Andrade [3:19:46]: In any way, shape or form, he just, he's there. And so, yeah. I'll let you know He's in a meeting right now, but it looks like he won't be available for this one, but

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [3:19:55]: Yeah, I think Chris, that's, that's a great idea and something that we could talk to Katrina about is maybe setting up an event or something that maybe once we get through a little bit more through like potter mechanics or whatever, maybe we could shift and you and me can work with Katrina to set something up as like an introduction, right? Katrina could do her part and show her how documentation is important, and then we could come in on the back end of that and be like this is what happens after documentation and then use that opportunity or that Zoom call or whatever that event that she does to bring in our

@Chris Andrade [3:19:56]: Here.

@Chris Andrade [3:20:20]: OK

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [3:20:25]: Networks and just present to them like, you know, you maybe even use plotter mechanics that this is what we're doing for our client and just tie everything together that way.

@Matthew Kerns [3:20:35]: Yeah, and we can share with her the whole education idea from the the Italian dude, I think his name is Matteo from The essentially talked about the champion, building a champion at each company, an AI champion, I think she would really like the idea. That was one that I wanted to make sure we share with her.

@Matthew Kerns [3:20:59]: If she hasn't seen it already

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [3:21:00]: That's so cool, yeah.

@Matthew Kerns [3:21:05]: Yeah.

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [3:21:06]: Yeah, I'll set up a time, OK

@Chris Andrade [3:21:07]: Hey guys, I'm on the phone. I'll I'll, I'll, I'm, I'm still the.

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [3:21:11]: No worries. I think

@Matthew Kerns [3:21:11]: Also I, I just wanted to say, I think,

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [3:21:13]: Yeah correct.

@Matthew Kerns [3:21:17]: I really need to just make some, we need to make like demo videos of what we're doing, and Just cause like we're like as as soon as we get rolling, people are gonna be wanting like asking us about things, and like, if we just have a demo video that we can just send and be like, hey, this is how we're doing this.

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [3:21:38]: I The

@Matthew Kerns [3:21:41]: Then they can get that info without having to have like an hour meeting and intro and like or or like

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [3:21:42]: Yeah. That.

@Matthew Kerns [3:21:48]: We still talk with it, we still have the connection and the intro, but we've already watched that.

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [3:21:50]: But we have our ass. Yep. So do you work on like a, if you work on like a, if you work on on like a framework or like an outline for that, we could like set aside some time this weekend and just start doing videos.

@Trent [3:21:54]: Yes, we don't wanna Scream the same thing

@Matthew Kerns [3:22:05]: Yeah, I'm, I have it on my plate to do videos cause I have, I have one that I'm, I owe this guy and then I have another couple of ones that I just need to get done. Like, for one, my one client, I wanted to get a demo video done and posted before I book a development call, so it's, and it's been on my plate for a few days, so I just need to book. I just need to set some time today and, and get through that. And then I'll share it with you guys too. Just a few, a couple demo videos.

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [3:22:21]: From

@Chris Andrade [3:22:32]: Yeah, I'm gonna be honest, I, I'm like, I have 5 more SD cards that I got to go through to, like I'm just getting really backed up on my photos and my videos on just the other stuff. So I'm gonna, I'm organizing my desktop right now, organizing all my files, and then I'm gonna move over to going through Malik's deliverables on the drive, that looks like I got thank you, Mika for setting that up. So I'll start putting that in I'm dry, and start working that problem. I'm gonna try to find the reason why I started going down with my videos

@Chris Andrade [3:23:08]: Is because I want to find that one that you, transcribed and maybe we can give her maybe some sort of video with that as well. I, I took those 3D model shots of the, the plotter mechanics store that I wanted to also put in there, so I'm getting all my media documents signed up and then so that's what I'm working on today. So, I'm here if you guys need me

@Matthew Kerns [3:23:36]: Sounds good

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [3:23:36]: You

@Trent [3:23:40]: Hey, Matthew, I wanted to ask you, do you have any knowledge of any way that, or a good way to transcribe The audio files indoor video files. Using a local resource, but, but that does a good job.

@Matthew Kerns [3:24:01]: So I don't know if it does a good job. I just spun up one that that is a thing that was is installed locally on my computer. I think it's like Whisper Local or something, but I just

@Trent [3:24:13]: Yeah, yeah. I went across that

@Matthew Kerns [3:24:17]: Yeah, I, so it works. It created the transcripts, but I didn't verify anything. I literally just Did it and fed it through the stuff, and it, I mean it creates

@Trent [3:24:27]: One thing it'd be interesting

@Matthew Kerns [3:24:29]: The audit stuff, but it's very good.

@Trent [3:24:30]: Sorry. No, yeah, sorry, it's like we have a little delay sometimes and we we overlap each other. the So Thinking about Chris's problem with his files and his audio files. We kind of talked about this earlier, but I think you stepped away.

@Trent [3:24:50]: In the future, having a few like a way to upload audio files and transcribe it, use the transcription to organize and extract details and basically go through our pipeline would be amazing in the future, but I'm thinking like right now, is there a way that Without pumping all of his audio files

@Trent [3:25:08]: Through OpenAI. Which could be expensive If we can find a way to Process them locally But I was thinking that if I can, we might be able to just use an example file.

@Matthew Kerns [3:25:20]: Yeah.

@Trent [3:25:25]: Like maybe the MP3 that I just did through OpenAI. And just push it through a local model, and then just compare the transcriptions.

@Matthew Kerns [3:25:36]: Yeah, sounds good

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [3:25:39]: This, I can't remember, but this fireflies have an option to like upload files and stuff or no?

@Trent [3:25:46]: It does have a way that you can upload video. I don't know about audio. I'm gonna guess you can audio.

@Chris Andrade [3:25:52]: Yeah, you can

@Trent [3:25:54]: I'm, I'm, but I'm, yeah, you might, maybe they maybe aren't.

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [3:25:57]: But you're saying entirely, right

@Trent [3:25:59]: Yeah, maybe you're onto something there. Maybe we can leverage, if you have a subscription to fireflies that maybe is like unlimited videos or audios or meetings. You could upload that file.

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [3:26:10]: Yeah.

@Trent [3:26:12]: And then it automatically transcribes it and puts it into your repository.

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [3:26:17]: Yeah, that could work. I have a business phone. I'm not sure. I got a check. But yeah, it's, I think I have the, I do have access to the Google Drive. I just saw it, so maybe I'll try that out, see if that works.

@Trent [3:26:27]: Yeah, so I'm just thinking about, you know, he, Chris has lots of audio files that have lots of valuable information in them, but he doesn't have a real good way right now to transcribe them without Going through some really length of.

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [3:26:39]: But I'm, that's just like a quick band-aid, but I think internally we should definitely have a way, because that's kind of like valuable info too. I don't know if we wanna, you know. But it's just figuring out a way to Yeah, extract that, I guess

@Trent [3:26:53]: Well, it didn't take me very long to ask Claude Code to create me the Python script to

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [3:26:54]: Yeah.

@Trent [3:27:01]: Parse through this file. So if we have a local model, like something that we can run locally, it wouldn't take me but a few minutes to Create something that we can at least use manually.

@Matthew Kerns [3:27:14]: Yeah, so check out it's already, it's already been pushed. You can just check out this Reade Trent, and then there's the audio processing tool. It's not super organized yet, but it's, it's all there.

@Trent [3:27:20]: Yeah, got it

@Chris Andrade [3:27:25]: Guys, guys, can you see my screen real quick? I forgot about this.

@Trent [3:27:29]: Yeah

@Chris Andrade [3:27:30]: OK, so this is my Instant 360, remember what I was telling you where this is where our meeting is gonna be taking place, right? We're gonna be looking at this TV.

@Matthew Kerns [3:27:30]: Yep

@Trent [3:27:37]: Yeah

@Chris Andrade [3:27:39]: Right? But check this out, this is what I wanted to show you. See this board?

@Matthew Kerns [3:27:48]: So the product types, the product, wow, you do, that's such good quality.

@Trent [3:27:52]: Yeah, it is

@Chris Andrade [3:27:53]: But this is their inventory management. And I was like, you mean to tell me, cause, cause look at where it's at. So this is Alyssa's desk right here.

@Matthew Kerns [3:27:58]: But

@Chris Andrade [3:28:04]: You see all these, you see what I mean by hyperlinks? Like, this is how they store all their shit. Right? Like, look at that, right? But this is how they keep track of all their inventory and look where it's at, right? where they walk, and I was like mean to tell me if I accidentally bumped my shoulder into this board. I'm gonna wipe out your inventory system.

@Trent [3:28:28]: Yeah, that's exactly what you're saying, yes.

@Chris Andrade [3:28:30]: Oh. So this is Alyssa's desk.

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [3:28:32]: It's such a good opportunity though

@Chris Andrade [3:28:34]: Alyssa's desk, right? This is Kelsey's desk This is his wife's desk, and so this is what I need. So I did a full walkthrough of the whole shop. This is while Kelsey was recording, the what you transcribed as the

@Chris Andrade [3:28:54]: The notes or for the, the SOP

@Trent [3:28:59]: Yeah.

@Chris Andrade [3:29:00]: This is what I was doing while he was doing that. But like look at their like Yeah, it's fish-eyed, but you just got to turn the camera. So I don't like, so if, if I turn it this way and zoom in, doesn't turn fisheye. But like we have a full, like we could even scale this if we wanted to, because these plotters, these

@Chris Andrade [3:29:23]: They're all like in dimensions, right? And then the way that that it is, I mean, it's easily scalable But This is what I wanted to show you guys on what we have. Oh yeah, this is the one I put on top of the desk. So this is the workshop, right? Oh, this is Joe's desk

@Chris Andrade [3:29:42]: This is Joe's desk This is the door when you walk in. Like, so apparently this printer right here is like a $200,000 printer. This one right here

@Trent [3:29:58]: Jeez

@Chris Andrade [3:29:59]: It's ink That like it has gallons of ink. But like, again, it's like how cool like we like this is Like I don't know if we can use any of this, but remember I was telling you about the shelves, like we can give the shelf systems a name.

@Chris Andrade [3:30:18]: And then ultimately show him which one, how we convention that name, you know. I don't, that's just an idea I had.

@Trent [3:30:28]: I just put a meeting poll. I just put in my Availability in there, so it looks like

@Chris Andrade [3:30:35]: OK.

@Trent [3:30:36]: I have more availability tomorrow than I have on Saturday, so.

@Chris Andrade [3:30:40]: OK Well maybe we got release party tomorrow and.

@Trent [3:30:40]: But

@Chris Andrade [3:30:43]: I'm fine with that

@Trent [3:30:46]: And then

@Chris Andrade [3:30:46]: Pretty cool though, right So this coming back though, this inventory manager, is there some, should I, should I use this for something?

@Matthew Kerns [3:30:49]: Yeah, it is.

@Trent [3:30:56]: Definitely

@Matthew Kerns [3:30:57]: Like I

@Trent [3:30:58]: Keep it. We need access to it. I don't know what we're doing with it just yet.

@Chris Andrade [3:31:02]: OK, so I, this is, this is that again there our customer portfolio

@Matthew Kerns [3:31:03]: Yeah

@Chris Andrade [3:31:08]: Like this is like what I'm talking about, you know what I'm saying? This is just a one camera.

@Matthew Kerns [3:31:13]: Yeah

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [3:31:15]: Chris, I think you're on to something. Like honestly, just like. All together, like what we're doing right now for Platter mechanics is such high value. Just you going in, taking doing your video, audio thing, and then us on the back end just tying it together is like a complete transformation process and like that's, that's so cool, like.

@Matthew Kerns [3:31:19]: Yeah.

@Chris Andrade [3:31:34]: The Brandy, the marketing, the low IQ with all of these like if you guys take Leo's playbook that we literally just got what, 2 days ago?

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [3:31:34]: Like I can't wait to like document this project.

@Chris Andrade [3:31:44]: We've been working this problem for, I think we just counted 13 days. We got a playbook on day 12. And if we kind of look at where we've been thinking and how we've been projecting, we're pretty fucking close to what Leo is already doing.

@Chris Andrade [3:32:01]: And I think we may even be able to one up the by offering our media capabilities as a component, as a full-on. Package, like a turnkey solution, not only to the systems, but to the money model itself by producing a marketing campaign that can generate money as well, and Trent, you know what I'm talking about when I'm talking about money models.

@Trent [3:32:29]: You have to

@Chris Andrade [3:32:30]: I Like We're not just your systems We are also your, we can be your media channel, your marketing channel, you're like, you need analytics on social media. Like, that's a whole other beast in itself. How do you know what money to spend on advertising if you don't know what

@Chris Andrade [3:32:52]: Budget performed on what iteration you're trying to commit, right? We can analytically tell you, yeah, you want to put more money on this campaign because it produces 10% better than all your other ones.

@Chris Andrade [3:33:08]: Right?

@Trent [3:33:09]: Yeah, yeah. I mean, we've got lots of, we've got lots of ways we can branch off and do these things for sure, and I

@Matthew Kerns [3:33:10]: Yeah

@Chris Andrade [3:33:14]: And the media, I think that's why the media is so important. Ay, cause I love to fucking do it, but B, because at the end of the day

@Trent [3:33:15]: You, you

@Chris Andrade [3:33:25]: When's the last time you're updating your website's been updated. When have you put new pictures on there? Oh yeah, I just haven't had time. Oh, well, let me hire a photographer. No.

@Matthew Kerns [3:33:33]: Yeah

@Chris Andrade [3:33:35]: Let me just call my photographer real quick. He'll come here on Tuesday and we'll get you squared away. Boom

@Trent [3:33:37]: Mhm. Yeah, yeah. So yeah, there's lots of opportunities for that stuff. And I, you know, we have people coming to us for white label stuff, development and services in the community, and I mean, if we can build something, you know, there's no reason that we couldn't leverage that same angle.

@Chris Andrade [3:33:55]: Yep. And not only that, I think it also contests, and this is what I've been speaking to, and honestly this is how I got so many people to put on our table is that I use my media company as the catalyst or the Trojan horse to understand their systems and ultimately then I'm ultimately seeing where the problems are that I can just scratch on and be like, hey, listen, now we have a solution over here

@Trent [3:33:56]: So

@Chris Andrade [3:34:23]: You know, and it's been working out fucking good. So why not keep doing it, you know?

@Trent [3:34:27]: Yeah, yeah Yup, yup.

@Matthew Kerns [3:34:30]: Yeah, the, the capturing of everything is the top of the funnel for this whole transformation process, so it's so awesome that you've done all that capturing like in all the different media formats,

@Trent [3:34:34]: It is And you've done a good job to, like, this is, I was thinking about this with the audio transcription is that these are are are most important assets, the things that we are feeding in that we're collecting for these opportunities and proposals is that, you know, when I said, when I said recording local, like transcribing locally, but I also said, does it well. That's very, very, very important because if we feed shit into our system, we're going to get shit out.

@Chris Andrade [3:35:10]: So speaking of that real quick, I want to touch on that because this is the 3rd time I missed it out. Trent, you built your deal out of Kelsey's Mike. I would suggest you download My Mi as well, because while Kelsey was in

@Trent [3:35:10]: So,

@Chris Andrade [3:35:26]: That room I was in where I just saw those pictures, taking those models, and I was talking to Joe and a list no, Joe.

@Trent [3:35:31]: Yeah.

@Chris Andrade [3:35:37]: About what he thinks he needs to do to make the company better? Like, what are his ideas that he has, and maybe Use that my audio file and find those things, if you will, about that moment with Joe.

@Chris Andrade [3:35:55]: Did I have a, I don't, I don't, I think it was just Joe because by the time Alyssa came in, I was already sitting down with Kelsey. So yeah, it would just be that.

@Trent [3:36:03]: Do do we have a transcription? Do we already have a transcription of that?

@Chris Andrade [3:36:07]: No

@Matthew Kerns [3:36:07]: Yeah, well, I made, I made the, I processed the 7 audio files and there was a few from Chris and a few from Kelsey, so they're in the, they're in the development OS next to this read me that I sent that I sent you, or in the act of active question.

@Chris Andrade [3:36:08]: I

@Trent [3:36:22]: OK I can run, I'll run my audio through it, Trent, and then I'll dictate, I'll dictate out what because I know what it was. It was just a section of Joe that I was really it's a, a really good

@Chris Andrade [3:36:37]: Piece of information, ultimately to understand the gaps in the workflow.

@Trent [3:36:43]: Yeah, I mean, if I had the transcription, I don't even, I mean, you, you know, you, you emphasizing what it is that you want to pull out is helpful. if you can just give me something.

@Matthew Kerns [3:36:44]: A

@Chris Andrade [3:36:48]: Right. Got it

@Matthew Kerns [3:36:53]: I wanna check.

@Trent [3:36:55]: Go ahead.

@Matthew Kerns [3:36:56]: I wanna, I wanna check if it's already in our audit because

@Trent [3:37:00]: Yeah, maybe

@Matthew Kerns [3:37:01]: Like, yeah, cause we pulled the transcription and so it should in theory it should be there unless the transcription that I use is just terrible.

@Trent [3:37:12]: And you did that with a local model with the whisper local.

@Matthew Kerns [3:37:15]: Yup, whisper local, yup.

@Trent [3:37:17]: OK, yeah, yeah. OK. So that would be, that would be interesting to see too. OK. Yeah, so you, you might, OK, yeah, let me look at that.

@Matthew Kerns [3:37:23]: Yeah.

@Trent [3:37:27]: Where you, where did you say that was at again? That's in your

@Matthew Kerns [3:37:31]: The the transcriptions themselves are In active projects under her plotter mechanics. And wait, are they here? Shoot, yeah, under audit and then under transcripts.

@Trent [3:37:51]: Is it operations active projects? Yeah, OK.

@Matthew Kerns [3:37:56]: Yes

@Trent [3:37:57]: It's auto mechanics and then audit

@Matthew Kerns [3:38:01]: Yup

@Trent [3:38:02]: Transcripts

@Matthew Kerns [3:38:03]: I did

@Trent [3:38:03]: I see it.

@Matthew Kerns [3:38:04]: Yup

@Trent [3:38:05]: I see it. OK, perfect. Yeah, that, so, yeah, so we can do, I can just use that. And then what's the full transcript? Is that where they just concatenated the What's.

@Matthew Kerns [3:38:18]: Yeah, I think it, it's just concatenation. I think at some point we could try and do like, OK, Chris said this, it literally just put them next to each other though.

@Trent [3:38:18]: What Oh It, that's what it did is it just concatenated with the title of the files in here. So it doesn't really have any perception of

@Trent [3:38:39]: Time. In here

@Matthew Kerns [3:38:40]: Yeah, no interleaving or anything like that.

@Trent [3:38:43]: Yeah, there's nothing like that. So, I might just quite literally only use the Cris. Stuff to do the to do what we're talking about. So, so,

@Chris Andrade [3:38:53]: Quick question, does anyone experimented about like when you're dictating or conversating like, hey, this is Chris here, just chiming in. Does the, with the AI bot picked that up and it ultimately classified that voice as Chris.

@Trent [3:39:06]: Yes, yes Yes, it will

@Chris Andrade [3:39:09]: I think we need to make sure we do that, especially when we're in interviews, like, oh, thanks Mike for that introduction or that explanation or, you know what I.

@Trent [3:39:20]: It looks for that. It it definitely looks.

@Matthew Kerns [3:39:22]: I don't know really I don't know if we even need to do anything extra because if you look at like fathom or fireflies breakdowns, it's like pretty much like Well, it does get some stuff wrong.

@Chris Andrade [3:39:33]: You have to separate you cause, cause I've had troubles doing that, and sometimes if you have more than 2 speakers or 3 speakers happening, then you have to pick out which one it is. And if, if you, if there's a name in that text for that speaker, then it's a lot easier to figure it out versus having to like reroll reverse roll, so just discussion.

@Trent [3:39:45]: But Yeah So, so Fireflies has an advantage when you have a virtual meeting with multiple people joining it. It knows where the audio stream is coming from. So if it's coming from me or coming from Matthew, it knows who is who, because there's a name attached to the audio, so if you're in the same room having a conversation with the same microphone, the same stream. That's where you're talking about would be a little bit more important

@Trent [3:40:29]: Is when we have the same audio stream.

@Matthew Kerns [3:40:32]: Yeah, long term though, we could probably build something in that trains automatically per person and identifies as who they are. Potentially.

@Trent [3:40:42]: Yes Yeah, potentially, you are correct. And there may be, you know, some of these transcription tools that we already have access to may have the ability to do some of that, so, we might have a shortcut to do it now and then maybe we need to build it in later to our solutions.

@Matthew Kerns [3:40:54]: Right.

@Chris Andrade [3:40:59]: Right

@Matthew Kerns [3:41:00]: Yes

@Trent [3:41:02]: So anyway

@Chris Andrade [3:41:02]: We keep man. I feel like we could seriously just stop, like, talk to each other all fucking day, and like just

@Trent [3:41:03]: Cool You could just jam on this all day, yeah.

@Chris Andrade [3:41:10]: Yeah, yeah, no I no, no, no doubt. I do got to get some stuff done, but yeah, I'll be back here I'd say in about an hour. if you guys need anything, just let me know.

@Trent [3:41:20]: OK OK, sounds good. I gotta jump too, so,

@Chris Andrade [3:41:25]: OK.

@Trent [3:41:26]: Awesome guys

@Chris Andrade [3:41:28]: Good stuff

@Matthew Kerns [3:41:29]: Sounds good yeah

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [3:41:30]: OK that's good

@Matthew Kerns [3:41:30]: Good

@Trent [3:41:32]: Good too.

@Matthew Kerns [3:41:32]: Yeah
