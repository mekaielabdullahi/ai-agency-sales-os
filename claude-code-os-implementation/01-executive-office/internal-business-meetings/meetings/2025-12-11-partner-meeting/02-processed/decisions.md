## Decision 1: Media Capabilities as Core Business Solution

**What Was Decided:**
Position the agency's audio/video processing and SOP creation capabilities as a comprehensive business transformation solution, not just a technical service.

**Context:**
- Trent successfully demonstrated creating detailed SOP from Kelce's audio recording using Whisper
- Team realized this capability is highly valuable across multiple businesses
- Current process: Audio recording → Transcription → SOP with process diagrams → Training materials
- Chris highlighted this is more than tech - it's capturing and systematizing operational knowledge

**Reasoning:**
- **Proven Value:** Kelce's SOP creation showed immediate, tangible business value
- **Repeatable:** Same process works for any business with undocumented workflows
- **Differentiator:** Most agencies don't offer documentation transformation
- **Scalable:** Can be productized and automated further
- **Market Need:** Every business struggles with training documentation

**Implications:**
- Agency positioning shifts from "AI consultants" to "business transformation documentarians"
- Media services (recording, transcription, SOP creation) become core offering, not auxiliary
- Need to invest in technology to streamline recording → SOP workflow
- Pricing model must reflect documentation value, not just transcription cost
- Marketing materials need to emphasize transformation outcomes

**Owner:**
Team - Strategic positioning decision affecting all client engagements

**Timeline:**
- Immediate: Apply to Plotter Mechanix proposal
- This month: Create demo videos showcasing SOP transformation
- Q1 2026: Productize the SOP creation service

**Success Criteria:**
- Clients see SOPs as primary deliverable (not just process maps)
- Agency can produce SOPs faster than clients can create them manually
- SOP creation becomes standard part of all engagements
- Revenue tied to documentation deliverables

## Decision 2: Selective Client Acquisition Strategy

**What Was Decided:**
Be highly selective about client acquisition, focusing only on high-value opportunities with clear transformation potential and avoiding clients that don't fit the agency's systematic approach.

**Context:**
- Chris tracking 10+ client conversations
- Team discussing bandwidth and resource constraints
- Realization that not all clients are good fits
- Need to focus on clients who value documentation and systematic improvement

**Reasoning:**
- **Quality Over Quantity:** Better to deeply transform 5 clients than superficially help 20
- **Resource Protection:** Team bandwidth is limited - must invest in right clients
- **Case Study Quality:** Flagship clients create better marketing materials
- **Revenue Model:** $10K/month clients require deep engagement, not quick projects
- **Strategic Focus:** Aligns with P0 priority (revenue from right clients)

**Implications:**
- Need qualification criteria for client opportunities
- Some prospects will be turned down or referred elsewhere
- Sales process includes evaluation phase (not just discovery)
- Longer sales cycles but higher conversion and retention
- Team must align on "ideal client profile"

**Owner:**
Team - Sales qualification process

**Timeline:**
- This month: Define client evaluation criteria
- Ongoing: Apply to all new opportunities

**Success Criteria:**
- Clear "yes/no" criteria for client acceptance
- Higher engagement completion rate (fewer abandoned projects)
- Better client satisfaction scores
- More referrals from satisfied clients

## Decision 3: Develop Proprietary Audio Processing Technology

**What Was Decided:**
Invest in developing proprietary mobile/web applications for seamless audio recording, transcription, and SOP generation to eliminate current workflow friction.

**Context:**
- Current pain: DJI mic requires download → upload → transcription (too many steps)
- Fireflies doesn't work for phone calls
- Plod note pen has subscription costs and limited integration
- Team needs solution that works for both internal use and client delivery
- Vision: Wearable or mobile app → automatic transcription → SOP generation

**Reasoning:**
- **Workflow Friction:** Current tools create too much manual work
- **Client Experience:** Kelce and future clients need easier recording
- **Competitive Advantage:** Proprietary tool is agency differentiator
- **Revenue Opportunity:** Could become SaaS product alongside services
- **Data Control:** Own the transcription and processing pipeline

**Implications:**
- Development investment required (Matthew + Trent)
- Need to decide: mobile app, web portal, or both
- Must integrate with existing Whisper transcription
- Client adoption depends on ease of use
- Could become separate product line

**Owner:**
Trent & Matthew - Technical development
Chris - Client requirements and use cases

**Timeline:**
- This month: Explore existing solutions and evaluate build vs. buy
- Q1 2026: Develop MVP for internal use
- Q2 2026: Beta test with Plotter Mechanix (if applicable)
- Q3 2026: Launch client-facing version

**Success Criteria:**
- Recording → SOP workflow takes <10 minutes (vs. current hours)
- Clients can use tool without technical assistance
- SOPs include screenshots/visuals automatically
- Integration with agency's delivery workflow

## Decision 4: Phased Client Engagement Model

**What Was Decided:**
Create engagement options with both short-term (quick win) and long-term (deep transformation) commitments, allowing clients to choose their level of investment.

**Context:**
- Mekaiel suggested phased approach during discussion
- Aligns with 3-tier model from Dec 10 meeting (Free Audit → Low-Cost → Scale)
- Some clients need quick wins to justify larger investment
- Others ready for deep transformation immediately

**Reasoning:**
- **Flexibility:** Different clients have different readiness levels
- **Risk Reduction:** Clients can start small and scale up
- **Revenue Predictability:** Short-term projects fund operations, long-term create recurring revenue
- **Conversion Path:** Easier to upsell existing clients than find new ones
- **Portfolio Building:** Short engagements create multiple case studies

**Implications:**
- Pricing must reflect different commitment levels
- Deliverables must be modular (can stand alone or build on each other)
- Sales process explains progression path clearly
- Team capacity planning includes mix of short and long engagements

**Owner:**
Mekaiel - Engagement model design
Team - Implementation across all clients

**Timeline:**
- This week: Document phased model options
- This month: Apply to Plotter Mechanix proposal
- Ongoing: Refine based on client responses

**Success Criteria:**
- Clients understand options and progression path
- 80%+ conversion from short to long engagements
- Revenue from short engagements covers operational costs
- Long engagements generate profit and recurring revenue

## Decision 5: Invest in Partner Sandbox Environments (NCP Instances)

**What Was Decided:**
Trent will provide each partner with their own NCP (AI tool environment) instance as a sandbox for experimentation and personal tool creation.

**Context:**
- Trent has built custom CRM and sales tools in his NCP instance
- DIY pod members interested in how it works
- Team would benefit from having their own experimental environments
- Isolates individual experimentation from production systems

**Reasoning:**
- **Skill Development:** Partners can learn by building
- **Personal Productivity:** Each partner can create tools that fit their workflow
- **Risk Isolation:** Sandbox failures don't affect production
- **Innovation:** Experimentation leads to discoveries (like Trent's SOP process)
- **Capability Building:** Team becomes more technically proficient

**Implications:**
- Setup and maintenance overhead for Trent
- Need documentation for how to use NCP instances
- Partners need time to learn and experiment
- Could discover new agency capabilities through experimentation

**Owner:**
Trent - Setup and training

**Timeline:**
- This month: Set up instances for each partner
- Ongoing: Partners experiment and share learnings

**Success Criteria:**
- All partners have functioning sandbox environments
- Partners regularly use and share discoveries
- New tools/workflows emerge from experimentation
- Team technical confidence increases

## Strategic Alignment

**How These Decisions Support OBG ($50K/month × 3 months):**

1. **Media as Core Offering** - Creates clear, valuable deliverable clients will pay for
2. **Selective Clients** - Focus resources on $10K/month clients, not $1K projects
3. **Proprietary Technology** - Speeds delivery = more clients = more revenue
4. **Phased Model** - Easier client acquisition → faster revenue ramp
5. **Sandbox Environments** - Builds team capability → better delivery → client retention

**Math to OBG:**
- 5 clients × $10K/month = $50K/month
- SOP creation as core offering = clear value clients understand
- Selective acquisition = higher close rate and retention
- Proprietary tools = faster delivery = serve more clients
- Phased model = easier entry = more clients in pipeline
