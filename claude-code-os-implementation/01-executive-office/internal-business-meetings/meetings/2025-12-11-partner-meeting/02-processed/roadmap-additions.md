## Detailed Breakdown

### Addition 1: Audio-to-SOP Platform (Web Portal)

**Description:**
Web-based platform that automates the workflow: audio/video upload → transcription → SOP generation with screenshots → formatted documentation. Both internal tool and potential client-facing service.

**Business Value:**
- **Speed:** 10x faster SOP creation than manual documentation
- **Quality:** Consistent, comprehensive documentation every time
- **Scalability:** Can process unlimited recordings without adding staff
- **Client Value:** Clients can create SOPs themselves without agency involvement
- **Revenue Model:** Potential SaaS product ($$$) or service offering (SOPs as deliverable)

**Target Outcome:**
Client uploads video of Kelce doing a task → Platform automatically generates:
- Full transcript
- Step-by-step SOP with screenshots
- Process diagram
- Training checklist

Matthew/Chris upload client calls → Platform extracts:
- Action items
- Decisions made
- Client requirements
- Follow-up tasks

**Priority Rationale:**
P1 - Agency infrastructure. Critical for scaling SOP creation service. Current manual process (download → upload → transcribe → format) takes hours. Automated platform reduces to minutes. Enables serving more clients without proportional labor increase.

**Owner:**
Matthew - Technical architecture and development
Trent - AI/transcription integration and SOP formatting logic

**Estimated Timeline:**
- Planning: 2 weeks (define features, UI/UX, architecture)
- MVP Development: 6-8 weeks (Q1 2026)
  - Phase 1: Upload + transcription (Whisper integration)
  - Phase 2: SOP generation (structured output)
  - Phase 3: Screenshot extraction (if video)
  - Phase 4: Client-facing portal (authentication, storage)
- Beta Testing: 2 weeks (internal use + Plotter Mechanix)
- Launch: End of Q1 2026

**Effort Assessment:**
- **Technical complexity:** High (video processing, AI integration, storage, authentication)
- **Resource requirements:** Matthew's development time (~40-60 hours), Trent's AI expertise
- **Dependencies:** Whisper API/local setup, cloud storage solution, frontend framework

## Strategic Alignment with OBG

**OBG:** $50K/month revenue for 3+ consecutive months

**How These Additions Support OBG:**

1. **SOP Service (P0)** - Immediate revenue stream, $2-5K/month minimum
2. **Audio-to-SOP Platform (P1)** - 10x speed = serve more clients = more revenue
3. **Client Qualification (P1)** - Right clients = $10K/month engagements (not $1K)
4. **Phased Model (P1)** - Easier entry = more clients = faster revenue ramp
5. **Mobile App (P2)** - Better client experience = higher retention = recurring revenue
6. **Sandboxes (P3)** - Team capability = better delivery = client satisfaction = growth

**Math to OBG:**
- 5 clients × $10K/month = $50K/month base
- SOP service adds $2-5K/month additional
- Audio platform enables serving 8-10 clients (not just 5)
- Client qualification ensures clients actually pay $10K/month
- Phased model brings 2-3x more clients into pipeline

**Timeline to OBG:**
- Dec 2025: SOP service launches → $2-5K/month
- Q1 2026: Audio platform MVP → 2x delivery speed
- Q2 2026: Mobile app → client adoption jumps
- Q2 2026: $50K/month achieved

## Technology Development Context

**Current Pain Points Driving Development:**
1. Recording friction (download → upload → transcribe)
2. Manual SOP creation (hours of formatting work)
3. Client onboarding complexity (too much friction)
4. Inconsistent deliverable quality (manual = variable)

**Vision: Seamless Documentation Workflow**
```
Client records work → Auto-transcribes → SOP generated → Client reviews → Agency refines
```

**Competitive Advantage:**
No other AI agency offers:
- Automated SOP creation from audio/video
- Client-facing recording tools
- 48-hour SOP delivery
- Systematic documentation transformation

This is the agency's moat.
