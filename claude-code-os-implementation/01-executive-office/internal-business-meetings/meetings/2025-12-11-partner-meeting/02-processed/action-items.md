- Audio transcription workflows (Whisper, Fireflies, Loom)
- SOP automation (audio → transcript → structured SOP with screenshots)
- Web portal concept for client-facing audio processing

**Business Insights:**
- 10+ client conversations in progress (Chris tracking)
- Need better recording + organization for all client interactions

## Notes

**Meeting Duration:** Nearly 4 hours - extensive strategic discussion

**Key Breakthrough:** Trent's demonstration of creating SOP from Kelce's audio recording validated the agency's core value proposition: transforming tacit knowledge into documented processes.

**Technology Gap Identified:** Current recording workflows are too cumbersome (download → upload → transcribe). Need seamless recording → processing → SOP creation.

**Strategic Positioning:** Team recognizing they're not just "AI consultants" - they're business transformation documentarians who use AI to capture and systematize operational knowledge.
