@Trent [0:26]: But

@Trent [1:04]: Hm

@Trent [2:14]: But

@Trent [3:03]: Hey Matthew

@Matthew Kerns [3:03]: Hey, what's going on? What's going on? Yeah The meeting was amazing. Great job

@Trent [3:11]: So Yeah, I mean, so I know we gotta work on our delivery, right? We gotta work on delivery. We, and we gotta work on, I, I gotta work on being able to pay attention to you guys, because I kept looking at the chat, but I was looking at it like way too late, and then I wasn't really paying that much attention. So there's definitely some, some work that needs to be done. But at the same time, you know, Kelsey's a really hard cat to, to hurt hurdle. So,

@Matthew Kerns [3:35]: After. Yeah.

@Trent [3:40]: So you know He's a

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [3:43]: He is

@Matthew Kerns [3:45]: Often talks about stuff, but I think that's going to be kind of like a lot of small business owners, especially ones that have the same problems that he has. Like they're just dealing with so many things that so much is going through their mind all the time. So It's gonna be some

@Trent [3:58]: So we're talking to him about his baby, right? I mean, this is his baby. Like he built this over 25 years and he's had to restart it and redo things so many times, and he finally feels like he has some traction and he's headed somewhere he wants to go.

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [4:02]: Right

@Trent [4:11]: He just needs some help getting there. So we're talking to him about all of the like He's getting excited about it because he's like, yes, these are great ideas. I love it.

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [4:22]: And then we're like, how do we, how do we pitch it together, right?

@Trent [4:22]: I

@Matthew Kerns [4:24]: Yeah

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [4:26]: It's, yeah, it was a lot. I was, I was not expecting that to go for two hours, but I was just like, wow. Yeah, it was, it was a good, like, it was a good, it was definitely a good run, good experience. I feel like I've learned a lot,

@Trent [4:30]: No, me either

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [4:37]: Yeah.

@Trent [4:37]: And we'll, we'll learn more every time we do it, right? So we'll learn more and more and, you know, at some point in time, we won't meet everybody in the call, but, you know, I think these are really good learning experiences for us,

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [4:48]: 1.

@Trent [4:49]: Yeah,

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [4:49]: You gotta get the reps in, right

@Matthew Kerns [4:51]: Yeah, for sure

@Trent [4:51]: Get that up buddy That's right That's right

@Matthew Kerns [4:55]: I do a manual before it can go automatic.

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [4:57]: Yeah

@Trent [5:00]: Yeah, yeah, so Why, why is the huddle theme, like under the ocean. Let's, let's change that. Oh, there we go, no, that'll work for you guys that don't have snow.

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [5:14]: Matthewsian shows palm trees.

@Matthew Kerns [5:15]: Yes, so Like I get back from my blog, but.

@Trent [5:20]: He's got palm trees in the background, literally.

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [5:23]: OK

@Matthew Kerns [5:24]: Yeah On my wife. Actually I got to jump back in after I get in through my gate, so I gotta

@Trent [5:29]: Right

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [5:32]: I just think that went. Overall, I was, I was happy with it. I think,

@Matthew Kerns [5:32]: Hang up.

@Trent [5:36]: Yeah.

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [5:38]: Obviously it's a learning experience. I, I think I'm happy with it. I almost like I was thinking like, We almost Did kind of a discovery, just about, right? But I kind of get to why people are doing the audit first and then the The, the integration phase, because it's a lot to kind of extract all of their problems, and then put it into solutions and essentially, if he knew about Qu like he could go integrate it, but like we gave him that solution, right? So like the audit is the product, you know, so I feel like it makes sense just from a business aspect that we should try to like, bring them into door, and I like the first, like the phases approach. I feel like we should tie like some type of documentation, some type of like small MVP and like mapping out of processes

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [6:22]: Into like the first or like part of the audit phase or the consulting phase, which would lead into like a development phase, you know, over a long period. Just from a business life, it's like 10,000 ft macro, you know,

@Trent [6:26]: Yeah Yeah. Yeah Yeah, I, I think, I think this gives us an opportunity now that they feel comfortable, they feel comfortable with if nothing else, they are, they are.

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [6:38]: To figure it out

@Trent [6:43]: They've all but paid us $5000 to do something, right? so, What this gives us an opportunity to reevaluate where we think we can take them. I think that we take what we have now, like what the information we have now, and let's just

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [6:58]: Yeah

@Trent [7:05]: Tweak our Quick win offer, just a little bit, whatever we need to do to refine that and hold onto that, but we need, I think we should come back with something bigger.

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [7:06]: Right

@Trent [7:17]: Like the primary thing we should come back with is something bigger.

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [7:21]: The package essentially

@Trent [7:23]: Yes, like this, the

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [7:24]: The longer engagement Or, or like a big, I would.

@Trent [7:27]: Oh.

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [7:29]: Go on. I was just thinking like, yeah, like, in general, right? Like, I'm just gonna pop up the website. So we have a four-faced approach, right? So I'm thinking 5K apiece to build out like we get the vision, right? And then 5K a piece of like each phase, you know, but we are, we have to understand phase 4 and what they want eventually, but as long as we can phase it out into these different phases into like sprints or whatever, 30 days, however many days you think it's going to take or phases or sprints, but essentially just like scope it out that way, you know.

@Trent [7:30]: Yeah Yeah Yeah, yeah, yeah

@Trent [7:58]: Yeah, we've kind of like, I mean, we're refining our Phase two. We don't really have phase one completely clear.

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [8:06]: At all

@Trent [8:07]: But I don't know that we're actually gonna, I actually see these, like you have 4 phases, and you could put very clear Lines on that, if you want to, but I almost see them as happening in parallel too, like for the very first engagement

@Trent [8:23]: It will be phase, phase, phase, but then I think as we learn more, we're going to be discovering more So it's kind of gonna be like overlapping where we're going to feed more information back in. For the next phases So, like, I don't know how to represent that, but I think you kind of know what

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [8:38]: Yeah I think

@Trent [8:43]: I mean.

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [8:43]: I think a way to do that would be to either just say like, hey, do you want like a small version of a discovery, or do you want like a bigger version of a discovery. I like how he did that, and we could essentially have two different offers and packages. Like we could have done the 5K for 30 days, right? Or we could have come back with like a 90 day more comprehensive, but it's tied to more results, I guess, you know, and more details, and then we could roll through the phases, and each phase is, and then like if you go with the bigger package, obviously it's going to be discounted and we

@Trent [9:04]: Yeah

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [9:13]: You're still gonna get everything with the other phases. Essentially, that's what I was kind of thinking, you know.

@Trent [9:16]: Yeah, so here's what I'm thinking right now is that I don't think the wife As much as I'd like to get them on a longer term engagement.

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [9:27]: They're not ready. We have to kill that first engagement.

@Trent [9:28]: You We have to kill the first engagement, right? We really have to do, you know, do it right, and I don't think we're going to be able to get them on a long-term engagement without doing the first Thing for them. We have to do something for them before we can get them in a longer term engagement because she's not convinced.

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [9:44]: I agree I agree I agree. For this, yeah, for this, for this client, but in general, like as we get more fines, we can play around with it, you know.

@Matthew Kerns [9:50]: Yeah

@Trent [9:54]: Yeah, yeah, yeah, we can play around and figure out what works. Sure.

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [9:54]: Sure.

@Trent [9:57]: Yeah.

@Matthew Kerns [9:57]: But I think for the for the prompt that you said, Trent, with, with like, OK, let's come to them with something bigger. Potentially what we can do because we want to make sure we overdeliver on phase one, and we're not getting paid a whole lot for phase one. So maybe we keep it sort of

@Trent [10:13]: Wait, wait, but wait. Hold on

@Matthew Kerns [10:15]: Yeah

@Trent [10:16]: I say we come back with something bigger and we ask for more.

@Matthew Kerns [10:23]: Maybe

@Trent [10:23]: Our, our, our $5000 is a quick win. It's just putting tools in place and getting them a few things that they can collect data and follow a process.

@Matthew Kerns [10:27]: Yeah

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [10:34]: Yeah. With the $5000 is. I think our opportunity right now is to think bigger

@Trent [10:41]: And and think longer But only still deliver something in 30 days, but something bigger that is more value that he can, we can charge him $10,000 for.

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [10:51]: For double the price system Yeah, I agree. I see what you're thinking, I see what you're thinking. That makes sense.

@Matthew Kerns [10:55]: OK. Like.

@Trent [10:57]: See what I'm thinking. This is our opportunity because they do sound like they're ready to engage with us.

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [10:58]: That makes sense

@Trent [11:04]: In, in a bigger way.

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [11:04]: Yeah Yeah, so we should shoot for 60 or 90 days, like a like a 60 day commit like a 60 or 90 day thing, a bigger, more deliverables, obviously, but think bigger in the sense of scope of work and project and deliverable.

@Trent [11:17]: Yeah, that's that's what I'm saying is like, OK, something I threw out in the WhatsApp chat chat is like, I'm just thinking like big and bold here that What could we do that would blow their minds that they would love, right? That's something that will truly add value to their what they have, and they, we've gone above and beyond.

@Matthew Kerns [11:32]: Yeah

@Trent [11:39]: And we, it's a stretch goal, like Matthew put it, a stretch goal, like, we might be able to give them this But we're not 100% confident.

@Matthew Kerns [11:47]: Yeah

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [11:49]: Pushing the edge, yeah, I like it.

@Trent [11:50]: Pushing the edge, but we, we don't promise them that.

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [11:52]: Yeah. Mhm.

@Trent [11:55]: We don't promise them our target. We promise them like 50 or 60% of what our target is.

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [12:03]: I agree.

@Trent [12:04]: And then if we miss it, we still, we still deliver.

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [12:08]: Look good, yeah, yeah.

@Trent [12:08]: Yeah. So what I'm at, so what I'm saying, what I'm proposing right now is what do we think would be awesome for them, if we could deliver it in 30 or 60 days. That we can come back and offer them with a larger dollar figure attached to it.

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [12:24]: I think essentially it's

@Matthew Kerns [12:24]: So I got an idea, but yeah, go ahead.

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [12:26]: Everything we have, I think we could just add a layer on. I think we have a good foundation, right? Maybe even more documentation or more workflow stuff, but it, the main thing I have to listen back to the transcripts or get the summary, but I think there's a few key points that they, they said is communication, and it was the time, like, right? So like, I think everything we have is good. I think we could, we could expand on that, maybe, cause it's gonna be required regardless, right? I don't think we throw away everything we have, but

@Matthew Kerns [12:48]: OK.

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [12:56]: I think we could figure something out.

@Trent [12:58]: What, what is some, what is something that we told them, I want to hear you out, Matthew. Sorry for jumping in there. but what is something that we kind of alluded that or almost explicitly told them that they could not have in phase one.

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [13:02]: Sorry, sorry about that

@Matthew Kerns [13:16]: Yeah, I think

@Trent [13:16]: If we can deliver that in phase one.

@Matthew Kerns [13:20]: Yeah

@Trent [13:20]: Just, that's where my mind's at.

@Matthew Kerns [13:22]: So what I'm thinking is he, his problem is like there's communications all over the place, and he doesn't even have time to get to his email and like if we basically we we're saying we can, our phase one is we get him on quo and we integrate with Jabber. So, but if we can add email, I think we need to hook into their email as soon as possible because they have pricing data in their email. So it's like if we just pull that and like

@Matthew Kerns [13:52]: That can be a quick win for us, but also like that can be the start of how we start tying in business value to the inventory system and then we try and move inventory forward as much as possible, like their naming scheme, I think it was a fantastic start. Like they already have started that process like that can shorten our timeline, like, and if we can, you know, start the inventory process and start getting a system where like

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [14:07]: And

@Matthew Kerns [14:22]: They can actually use it. I think that's our stretch goal. This is like literally the inventory into Jobber.

@Trent [14:28]: I'm wondering, I'm wondering, here's what I'm thinking now, right? Is that we have some proposed tools that we want to try to help him put into place that helps us in the future What if we were to help him see that future earlier, like what you're suggesting is that without us, without us having to put a new tool in place, leveraging the tools that we kind of already had planned to put in place.

@Trent [14:56]: How can we expand and make that blow their minds, right? So, if we're using N8N and we're using Jobber, and we're using Quo, and then if we even tie in the email.

@Matthew Kerns [15:00]: Mhm.

@Trent [15:09]: There is like, I don't know, limitless possibilities of what we can potentially do with just like those tools, right?

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [15:12]: Unlimited

@Matthew Kerns [15:18]: Yep Like literally like maybe a what would blow their mind is like an agent that Alyssa can use that hooks into all those data and then she can use that and like everything is automatically into Jobber, and then she has an agent she can chat with.

@Trent [15:20]: So What if we could do,

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [15:34]: What about, what about an internal agent?

@Trent [15:35]: What What, what about we just start building them out. The N8N Chat agent somehow, or we can put our own user interface, whatever that ends up looking like, OK? Just to chat. I don't want to spend a bunch of time building a UI though.

@Matthew Kerns [15:53]: Yeah

@Trent [15:54]: Like I don't want to build a platform. So, like in my eyes, I mean, I'm, I'm Up to the challenge, I think we should take it on, but

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [15:59]: Functionality over UI.

@Matthew Kerns [16:02]: Yep. I think we're gonna end up It might even help us to have an, an agent that can pull data from the different sources. So while we're building, we might just accidentally create an agent and then it's just building the UI on top of it.

@Trent [16:18]: Yeah, I mean, we can give them a basic UI like with the N8N chat hub, but the thing I was concerned about there is the entry point to it is you have to go into NAN.

@Matthew Kerns [16:24]: Yeah Yeah.

@Trent [16:32]: So it's not

@Matthew Kerns [16:35]: It's another software

@Trent [16:35]: Like Yeah, so not only that, but it doesn't necessarily

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [16:43]: Could you call that web hook into like maybe like their website for like internal use, or no?

@Trent [16:49]: He's, he's paying for Jat GBT. What if we just either have him switch to Claude, or

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [16:52]: I

@Trent [16:56]: Try to use chat GPT or something as the user interface. And link it to our back end systems. Like what I'm doing with my, with my cloud mobile app. I, it's just, I'm trying to figure out a way to make it easy to use and easy to use on the computer, easy to use on the phone, but we're linking into their systems, giving them real business value.

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [17:21]: Mhm. So

@Trent [17:24]: Right?

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [17:25]: Yeah, ChachiBT would be good. I don't know but I think that's the least like most user friendly, and he's already familiar with it, but yeah, I like going back to the NAN Like, you have to, I know he's not willing to go into NAA probably doesn't want to, but like, why can't we use that functionality or like

@Trent [17:45]: Well, the, the, the pro

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [17:45]: To and

@Trent [17:47]: We, we can use NAN. I'm not saying not to use NAN at all. What I'm saying is that the front facing UI

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [17:54]: Yeah, it has to be nice

@Trent [17:55]: Yes, so, so the hub, like, OK, so let me just show you.

@Matthew Kerns [18:00]: And it should be ideally, it could be something that they already use.

@Trent [18:00]: OK. Ideally, it is something they already use that they can they can easily interact with everything else with, right? I think that we are headed into a future where we're gonna have chat interfaces, be one of our primary ways to communicate with technology.

@Trent [18:21]: I think that the future is that.

@Matthew Kerns [18:21]: Yeah For sure

@Trent [18:25]: Maybe not forever, but that's where we're headed to in 2026.

@Chris Andrade [18:29]: That's where all these platforms are moving to, all these tools, service providers, that's the only way. Like the other day, I was moving, changing some TXT records on the website, and I was just, I asked the chappo to do it and I did it, and I was just like, holy fuck, like they're already integrating that on their back end, so we're just tying into that.

@Trent [18:45]: I know, exactly, that's what we're, that's basically what we're doing here. And so, Hold on, let's see. I wanted to pull up this.

@Chris Andrade [18:53]: I just wanted to say real quick guys, real quick.

@Trent [18:55]: Yeah

@Chris Andrade [18:56]: So His wife at first, like I was like, oh my gosh, like we're losing her, we're losing her, we're losing her. She, you guys didn't like you heard what she said at the end, right? Like,

@Matthew Kerns [19:08]: Yeah

@Chris Andrade [19:10]: That for us, we, we turned a skeptical individual who was honestly, I felt like she was like getting ready to throw up her hands for a second. And then at by we turned her around, guys. We turned like she was like, honestly, she's like, when she said it too, like, I got 5 more people that can use this if you guys could actually do it. So I was like, oh shit. So, sorry, I just had to say like

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [19:16]: You

@Matthew Kerns [19:36]: Yeah, that was one

@Chris Andrade [19:39]: They are beyond excited, Kelsey is fucking tickled at the opportunity of just getting clarity, like we gave these guys clarity and like they, they just feel, I could see relief and not only

@Chris Andrade [19:56]: Kelsey, but Alyssa and Joe, like they, it seems like we, we picked up the morale of that office. It's so cool. So I just wanted to let you guys know that real quick.

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [20:07]: Like

@Trent [20:10]: Yeah, that's awesome. That's awesome. I think that, you know, yeah, I was concerned. What's the wife's name, Nikki, or?

@Matthew Kerns [20:16]: Yeah.

@Trent [20:18]: I think it's Nikki. Alyssa is actually the office assistant.

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [20:23]: I was calling her Elisa the whole time

@Chris Andrade [20:25]: Yeah, so, yes, she's the, she's the administrator and Nikki's the wife.

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [20:30]: OK.

@Trent [20:31]: So, OK, so I felt like she came in very skeptical, and she was just waiting to just tell us no. Like she was just like, well, I'll let them talk a little bit and I'm just going to tell him no.

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [20:42]: And try to point holes in their, in their, in their offer or whatever they're offering. And once she got a little bit of clarity herself and we explained it to her. I think, yeah, she's on board

@Trent [20:46]: Right I, I, I know that we had to get our word in so that we try to explain where we're at, but she was at a point where she was just like, give me a number or I'm done. So, we'll have to

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [21:00]: Yeah We did drag it a bit

@Trent [21:02]: We'll have to figure out how

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [21:03]: That's good too

@Trent [21:04]: So you know, I think we did shoot ourselves in the foot by offering this the 50, but hey, we, we, we, we, we, cause she like jumped a lot easier than I thought. Like, I guarantee you we would have told her 7500, she would have done just as fast. But we're getting we got a lot of value on that. I just wanted to show.

@Trent [21:23]: Well Yeah, so here, here's what we're talking about in here, Chris, before you came in, is that Yes $5000 we effectively have all but received the $5000 right? To do something for them.

@Trent [21:42]: So What I'm looking at now is this is our opportunity to reevaluate. And come back with something that is much bigger for them.

@Chris Andrade [21:55]: Uh-huh

@Trent [21:56]: Like the we'll still hold on to and we'll still offer and we'll still

@Chris Andrade [21:57]: Mhm

@Trent [22:04]: Execute on the quick win if that's what they want to do. But it's going to be less, right? It's gonna be less money and less results, less outcomes. Oh. But what I'm trying to talk to these guys about right now is what is our stretch goal What is something that we could give them that would be amazing that they would absolutely see value in that we told them they couldn't have in phase one, or they don't believe they can have in phase one.

@Trent [22:32]: That we can deliver on To get them

@Chris Andrade [22:36]: I mean

@Trent [22:37]: To do 30 days or even 60 days.

@Chris Andrade [22:38]: I think I, and, and as long as we can, intelligently. Demonstrate that, right? And, and then not only can we demonstrate it, but then give them like how McKel, you know how like that first set of the first iteration of our

@Trent [22:48]: Yup.

@Chris Andrade [22:59]: Our Deliverable. It gave them that three options that they can choose from depending on which ones they like.

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [23:05]: Yeah, I can just, yeah, yeah.

@Chris Andrade [23:07]: Maybe we can on with that You know what I'm saying? We give them hey, we're giving you guys 3 different options, 3 different

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [23:09]: Yeah

@Chris Andrade [23:12]: Packages. Package one is the grand, you know what I mean? And then, let, let them choose, you know.

@Trent [23:16]: Yeah. Yeah, and that's, and that's fine. Yeah. And we can do that. So here, here's what I'm trying to figure out how we can do this, right? is that I want In my mind I would love it for them if we could overdeliver, but

@Trent [23:33]: But get them to where They see really tangible results. And we knock it out of the park for the first, the first iteration, right? The first pass

@Matthew Kerns [23:46]: Maybe o and Jaber sooner than they expect, and then

@Trent [23:52]: It can be timer

@Matthew Kerns [23:52]: Follow up with more.

@Trent [23:53]: Yep Sorry, go ahead

@Matthew Kerns [23:57]: That's pretty much it. I mean, follow up with more like email integration and starting to track inventory potentially get a good hold on inventory by the end of 60 days, 75 days.

@Matthew Kerns [24:13]: Stretch goal

@Trent [24:15]: Yep, yeah, yeah, yeah.

@Chris Andrade [24:16]: So I'm just, I'm just thinking out loud here after actually seeing her and then, I feel like we kind of pigeonholed ourselves into the 5000. And I don't want to change it up. That's why I mean let's give them the 5000 and those set of deliverables, right?

@Trent [24:35]: OK

@Chris Andrade [24:36]: But then let's do what you're talking about, like, give them the ultimate package and say, hey, just so you know, after our meeting, we also came up with this plan. Now I know you're hesitant. We still got to give you our, you know, to show, to give that trust.

@Trent [24:53]: Yup

@Chris Andrade [24:53]: So we're just giving you options and you, we're giving you what we can do. It's ultimately for you to decide, and I think that would, we give them that still like we're not taking that $5000 offer back.

@Trent [25:05]: Yeah No

@Chris Andrade [25:05]: But we're just expanding on it, on it, you know what I'm saying.

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [25:08]: Or, or, or, or I feel like another option we have is something we could do is we could keep the 5K deal and keep how it is over deliver on how we just talked about Trent and do that, and then after the 30-day engagement,

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [25:24]: Then sell them on. The bigger or the grander, like just the other phases essentially, and just keep that in our back pocket or just iterate on 30-day figures like we kinda, we have options, that's the beauty, you know.

@Chris Andrade [25:33]: Right

@Trent [25:38]: I'm looking at how, how can we stop it, right? We, we say we're still going to do everything that we promise in the quick win.

@Chris Andrade [25:39]: So. Yeah.

@Trent [25:46]: And then we stack something on top and say, if you guys want to go even further. Faster We'll stack this on top for 10,000, right? So

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [25:58]: Just give that to them as an offer

@Trent [26:01]: Yeah

@Chris Andrade [26:01]: And you know where that value would hit is if we can figure out oh what like some sort of plan using the quote system to develop or enhance the like a plan to ultimately tackle their inventory, right?

@Trent [26:17]: Yeah.

@Matthew Kerns [26:19]: Yeah

@Chris Andrade [26:19]: And they say, hey, because we're using quo We can now start gathering the analytics specific So, you know, we use the transcript to pull out all of the inventory context or whatever however that looks, and they say, hey, we're going to start focusing up on the inventory at the same time. Is that something we can do that like added on value?

@Trent [26:43]: That's, that's what we're trying to think of right now is like, how could we like seriously

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [26:43]: Yeah

@Chris Andrade [26:47]: OK.

@Trent [26:50]: Like stretch this out And overdeliver. So if we're just gonna do a 5000,

@Chris Andrade [26:54]: Well.

@Trent [26:56]: If we're gonna do the 5000, what we do is we promise it in 30 days, and we try to overdeliver and in two weeks, right?

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [27:02]: Yeah

@Trent [27:04]: What are they gonna say, hey, what if we give them the bare bones for the 5000. We said it was going to take 4 weeks, but it was just say we do it in 2 weeks. I'm like, hey.

@Chris Andrade [27:14]: We actually, we're, we've got pretty good at it and now we just paid 5000 out in two weeks, then we can ask for the next chunk of change because dude, not only did we save our, we gave you on the 5000. We, we are two weeks ahead of schedule. Now we can already move on to the second phase. What do you think?

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [27:15]: Me

@Trent [27:24]: Yeah Yeah, you're, you're, you're convincing me that we should probably just literally just dial in what we want to do for $5000 and get it done as soon as we possibly can so that we can prove that I can do it, and then the next one we, you know, 10 or 15 or 20 depending on what we believe the value is.

@Matthew Kerns [27:36]: No

@Chris Andrade [27:40]: Yeah Yep Yup

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [27:51]: Yeah, we're, we're, we're in that trust-building phase right now. Like this first engagement, they're gonna see how we work, so I think it is like we sold them on 5K today. I'd say we'd take that and deliver and then re-engage and just see where they're at, we're at.

@Trent [27:52]: Is

@Chris Andrade [27:54]: Yup Yeah Like, let's go with the MVP for that, right? Like, so if, if it's just, what does that look like? OK, that's the middle man that you guys were fantasizing on but the the establishment from Kelsey's phone

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [28:07]: Hm

@Chris Andrade [28:20]: Installing quo to ultimately communicate the jobber and then ultimately it's like, let's, how does that look? And then was to find that and then let's put that in a quote and just send it off And then see if they approved on it or not like, oh my gosh, you guys can do this for $500 in 4 weeks and then we do it in 2.

@Trent [28:42]: Well, yeah, we'll, we'll, we'll, we'll either do one or two things. We'll either deliver it very quickly, or we'll deliver it and maybe go a little over and we'll have more things than we promised them.

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [28:55]: And we could meantime secretly be working on phase two, like we can tackle some of the inventory stuff.

@Matthew Kerns [28:57]: You know Yeah, I think we

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [29:03]: We can detect

@Matthew Kerns [29:05]: I think we work on more stuff, and we deliver the stuff that's ready, and we try to overdeliver on the time delivery because that's how we get to 5000, and that increases our hourly rate if we, like our, our personal pay, if we can deliver faster to get to that 5000, and then we have their trust, and then we're like, OK, now,

@Trent [29:20]: Yup That's

@Matthew Kerns [29:29]: That you guys know what we can do, let's talk about the next phase and how much it's going to cost and the ROI we expect.

@Trent [29:37]: Yeah, so let's, so what we're, what we're talking about right now is let's do a very focused deliverable. That we can, we know we can deliver in a shorter time frame than 30 days. Right? We, we know we can do it. Well, I mean, OK, there's variables, right? So that's why we're going to say 30 days because we know there's some unknowns.

@Chris Andrade [29:50]: Yeah Right

@Trent [29:57]: OK But at the same time, we're gonna try to just zero in on delivering this as quickly as possible.

@Chris Andrade [30:06]: Yeah

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [30:06]: All right.

@Chris Andrade [30:07]: That's gonna show good faith to them, and it's gonna look way better for us, you know, like we're getting like a multiple win off of just our first iteration and And, and we want to prove to Nicky that we're good, so she can get us to her 5 other people right off the bat, you know?

@Trent [30:26]: Yeah, yeah

@Matthew Kerns [30:27]: Yeah

@Chris Andrade [30:28]: Dude, what is the best form of advertisement. Like you can't buy that shit. You know.

@Trent [30:28]: There we go

@Chris Andrade [30:37]: And we got it with our first iteration, our very first run, if that can be possible, it's a dream come true, my fellas.

@Trent [30:45]: Yeah, I think that I think we can do this. It's just like, let's put the places, the pieces in place, and let's refine the the the

@Matthew Kerns [30:46]: Yep.

@Trent [30:54]: The deliverables for the quick win.

@Chris Andrade [30:57]: Hey, also, can we take a minute

@Matthew Kerns [30:58]: Things we don't keep I just want to say real quick.

@Chris Andrade [31:00]: I, sorry, Mac.

@Trent [31:03]: You group hug? Is that what you're gonna say.

@Matthew Kerns [31:06]: No

@Chris Andrade [31:08]: Do you wanna take a minute though, and I do want to like, can we like figure out What could, can I, can I say everybody just say one thing they could have done better this time around. For me What I could have done better was

@Chris Andrade [31:25]: Test out my fucking, because I had that camera. I was trying to connect the goddamn remote to the camera on my phone so I can move the camera around and just be better prepared, just on that side.

@Trent [31:36]: Mine would be paying attention to the team in the back and then also like delivery. Controlling the client is gonna be really difficult with Kelsey. So he's a challenge for sure. So,

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [31:47]: Yeah. I, I could have, I could have engaged more. I feel like supportr a little bit more, I feel like. Also, clothes a little stronger. yeah, I feel like there, like there's gonna be that one person to engage with the client and then the one person that kind of like steer the combo or whatever, like, you know, yeah, and then almost like.

@Matthew Kerns [31:52]: Yeah

@Trent [31:56]: Oh It's hard Like there was no way that like it was so difficult for anybody to interject because there was this no dead air.

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [32:16]: Between Chris and Kelsey, I was like

@Matthew Kerns [32:17]: Yes

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [32:19]: I.

@Chris Andrade [32:20]: It's

@Matthew Kerns [32:22]: Me and I was like, yes, I've been waiting to say something like, perfect.

@Trent [32:25]: I'm, I'm, I'm trying, yeah, I'm trying to like pass the ball, man.

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [32:30]: That's, that you have some great patience bro. I'll, I was interrupting a bit too much. I didn't, I just was not patient, like.

@Chris Andrade [32:32]: What you

@Trent [32:38]: I know I was losing my patience a little bit too. I, I wanted to hear Kelsey talk at the same time, we're just like going off and, and, and nowhere lands. I mean, not nowhere, it's valuable, but like off topic, so.

@Matthew Kerns [32:51]: And then one, like the things that I could do better, I think the demo video, I could have like refined that more like or or I could have also set the expectation for it better. before I showed it, and then the other two things are like, I could have eaten breakfast and I could have gotten a haircut, like, no.

@Chris Andrade [33:07]: Yeah

@Trent [33:12]: Well, yeah, but look at me. I'm, I'm still looking like DJs and I, I didn't chill, so.

@Chris Andrade [33:15]: Yeah, you You got

@Matthew Kerns [33:18]: But

@Chris Andrade [33:18]: Kelsie saw you guys and he's like, yeah, these guys just rolled up out of bed. Oh shit. First impression, all right. And then, OK, let's flip it around. the other thing, I think what went good is just the overall connection that we established with the client. And at the end of the end, like that for me was like the best thing out of all of it.

@Trent [33:45]: He had all 4 people there, all key key people that we needed there, right? So there Joe, which we actually don't know that we were actually going to have him. Alyssa was definitely somebody we wanted in on it, and Kelsey and then by requirement, his wife had to be there, so.

@Chris Andrade [34:02]: Yeah Yeah.

@Matthew Kerns [34:03]: Go in, his name is Joe Ed, by the way, Jo E Cruz.

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [34:06]: It's cool too. Yeah, so, so, OK, so we've determined that, so how do we want to go forward to refine this and when are we going to target delivery.

@Matthew Kerns [34:19]: So I, oh yeah, that was the thing I wanted to mention is like, I don't think so we promised them like by February 1st. I don't think we pull that in. I think we leave it there and then we still try and obviously like deliver in 2 weeks, just blow them out of the water.

@Trent [34:37]: Like, do we, do we wait and delay and then wait until January 1st or 4th or whatever the first week is, and then we take Go time

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [34:48]: We could say, we can honestly just say. Give us till January 30th

@Matthew Kerns [34:51]: Like, oh

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [34:53]: And we, we get, we get started right away and give a February 1st, we, we'd love to get started right away. And then we can honestly kill it and then secretly on the back end. And then I think we have our deliverables, right, for the first week, I think we were all in line.

@Trent [35:05]: You need to go find them. We're, we need to dial them in, OK? Yeah.

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [35:09]: And

@Matthew Kerns [35:10]: Is going to like take time, like I didn't read the full thing that Dennis said in the DIY chat, but basically switching his number over might take almost the full 2 weeks, so we gotta like start that process as soon as possible. And then we can be testing and validating with like test environments in the meantime, and once it's hooked up, then we test the live thing, but getting it done in 2 weeks is gonna be quite a challenge, and it probably will go to 3 weeks, what I'm guessing it's.

@Trent [35:39]: The way that Dennis explained it, was that When you sign up for quo, you get a number. Then you, you take the existing number and you forward the calls to the new number. And you initiate the transfer at that time.

@Matthew Kerns [35:54]: OK

@Trent [35:58]: And it takes time for the the transfer to the port to port over. During that time, it has to just be forwarding the calls. So it's not fully integrated until that gets ported over.

@Matthew Kerns [36:09]: Mhm

@Chris Andrade [36:13]: I gotta hop off for a little bit. I'll come back on.

@Trent [36:15]: OK

@Matthew Kerns [36:16]: OK. So then,

@Trent [36:18]: So that's the way Dennis said they do it all the, he said, that's the way we do it all the time. Like, I mean, that's like his standard protocol.

@Matthew Kerns [36:19]: Is That

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [36:26]: Which makes sense, right? You get that two week buffer, like you wanna trans you wanna initiate as soon as possible, and then meanwhile, it'll forward off to your actual number, and then after the two week sink or whatever, you'll, it'll just port back to the original phone number and it won't use the quote one, right?

@Matthew Kerns [36:27]: Right, so that's

@Trent [36:42]: Yeah, I'm just worried about the, the compromises.

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [36:46]: Yeah

@Trent [36:47]: I'm worried about what, what doesn't work during that one week period.

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [36:47]: And it Yeah

@Trent [36:52]: Or 2 week period that it's not. Working, right

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [36:57]: Yeah Yeah Well, we can talk to Dennis, see how, if he has experience using it, but I don't

@Trent [37:04]: He doesn't have experience with quo, he said, but they have other ones that they use, however, it's a standard porting process. Like when you're moving a number from a phone to a phone or a phone to a service or a service to another service.

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [37:15]: Yeah

@Trent [37:15]: It's, it's a standard thing. That Is the same no matter where you go.

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [37:22]: Got it So it's like, OK. So that is something to think about too. that could go it could go sideways. I don't expect it to, but it could, you never know. worst case, I think it's there We should always have a contingency, right? Like,

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [37:40]: Worst case, what's the worst thing that can happen if that process goes bad, his phone, he won't have access to his business phone.

@Trent [37:46]: Well If, if for any reason we lose the number, yeah, but up until the point that it ports over to Quo, We just have, he still has the number. It's not like the number's not functional. The numbers still functions, but on the day that it moves,

@Trent [38:02]: What'll happen is that the number will no longer be going to his cell phone. It'll be going to quo.

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [38:09]: Got it. And that new number, yeah. So some phone numbers might not go through.

@Trent [38:11]: Yeah Yeah, so, so it's, it's more like The experience will be different. So, it, I'm concerned a little bit about outgoing calls. Because

@Trent [38:28]: When, when you forward a call, so that means Someone calls up the number. The number actually gets rerouted to a 2nd number. It it actually just gets redirected to another number.

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [38:40]: Yup.

@Trent [38:41]: But In the other direction So if Kelsey picks up the phone,

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [38:47]: I go there

@Trent [38:47]: And he's dialing out We may not have any quo integration When he dials with his business number to somebody else.

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [38:56]: Got you

@Trent [38:57]: I don't know how that works

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [39:00]: OK.

@Trent [39:01]: This is something that we can either get on the hook with quo. On.

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [39:07]: Mhm.

@Trent [39:09]: He, I think that's actually probably going to be one of the best things is to just try to get a hold of somebody a quote.

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [39:14]: Directive source, yeah

@Trent [39:15]: And say, hey, look, here's our here's our plan. What does it require and what is gonna happen. And also get us access to a free trial, which we can go do right now. You can go get a free trial of quo for 14 days, right off the bat. Same thing with Jouber, you can go get a 14-day free trial at Jouber.

@Trent [39:36]: But I don't know if that gives us access to APIs. I don't know what that gives us. It'll give us a number, I believe we'll get a phone number. That we can use, but we are, we aren't going to want to port our phone numbers over to it.

@Trent [39:54]: So the, the actual porting is not going to be something that we do.

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [39:54]: So OK. What do we need to do it or no?

@Trent [40:02]: I don't think we need to do it. I think we just need to understand it.

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [40:05]: OK.

@Trent [40:06]: And I think quo can help us with that

@Matthew Kerns [40:07]: I mean That is a good prompt though, like, should we just for the sake of avoiding interrupting his business, like set up just a test number that we test the forwarding on right before so we can do that port forwarding and experience what happens right before we switch his over.

@Trent [40:27]: No We, we can test it on our demo. Like our demo, we should be able to take one of our numbers And forward it to that, so that we can experience what that's like. We'll never port it. Not gonna port it at all. We won't do that at all. But what we'll do is we'll set up phone number forwarding or phone call forwarding.

@Matthew Kerns [40:42]: Oh OK

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [40:48]: I think that's at least, yeah, we could test that easier, right? I shouldn't take too much one because one of our numbers is just hook up to the thing, yeah.

@Trent [40:51]: Yeah

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [40:55]: We could test that right away, like we should start testing that right away. I could sign up.

@Trent [40:55]: Yeah

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [40:59]: Port my thing

@Trent [40:59]: Yeah Yeah, I think probably it'll be me or Matthew, trying to set that up because we'll have to be very quickly trying to test and try to integrate and build features on top of that. So, cause we're gonna want to understand exactly what we can do.

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [41:03]: OK Right.

@Trent [41:18]: As soon as possible

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [41:20]: Yeah. That makes

@Trent [41:22]: Yeah. So But I think step one here is that we need to get them on the Get them signed

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [41:32]: Mhm

@Trent [41:34]: And get payment So We need to just dial in the deliverables. Now, the deliverables that we're gonna give them Are spelled out on the statement of work. But we need to dial that in on that what we're actually planning on delivery.

@Trent [41:50]: Like what we're gonna promise To deliver

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [41:53]: Yeah, what's on, what, what are we on the hook for actually, and then what do we want to deliver?

@Trent [41:57]: Yeah, we should have a stretch goal. Of what we want to deliver, but then also what are we? So, Coming back just real quick while I have it up. The the way that the N8N chat interface works. I, I have it up. You guys can see it, I assume.

@Matthew Kerns [42:14]: Yup

@Trent [42:15]: Yeah, OK. So, What I was concerned about was the fact that you, this is NAN, and it's a, we can give them I guess, the home chat is really the direct Link to get in there

@Trent [42:31]: Right

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [42:32]: Mhm

@Trent [42:33]: Right, the forward slash home chat, so they could just have a shortcut to it. To, they can start using this like

@Matthew Kerns [42:38]: Mhm.

@Trent [42:41]: I don't wanna say from day one, but after week one, probably they could start using something like this if we build something for them. And, but one of the problems is this If I click on the N8N logo, it'll take them into this UI.

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [42:57]: Yeah, what, they don't know what they're looking at.

@Trent [42:57]: This We don't want them in this UI. So we don't really want them.

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [43:04]: Is there a way to lock it down by user or no?

@Trent [43:07]: Let's see. Oh, maybe. So

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [43:10]: Permissions maybe

@Trent [43:11]: I can invite, I'd have to invite, let's see. Or I can do this. I have a demo email, that's fine, I'll do that. So you can do member or admin, so, well, I guess I can't do admin, didn't let me.

@Trent [43:28]: So

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [43:28]: Yeah, so maybe it's already locked down my preference.

@Trent [43:31]: Yeah, let me see what it does It's my roll. I think you get more granular access controls when you pay for a license, but let's just see what we get for free.

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [43:42]: Yeah, I'll guess what I got in the mail and just picked this up. Thank you.

@Trent [43:46]: Nice. Awesome, man.

@Matthew Kerns [43:47]: Nice

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [43:49]: Appreciate it. I can't wait to get into it.

@Trent [43:50]: It's. For sure See,

@Matthew Kerns [43:53]: Then

@Trent [43:54]: See, where's my email at? I got too many email Boxes

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [43:59]: Same, story of my life.

@Trent [44:04]: There's Chris I haven't seen one. I haven't seen it come in yet. Let's turn at gmail.com, says pending.

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [44:19]: Oh, I gotta get my key

@Trent [44:26]: I don't know why, but I haven't gotten the invite yet.

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [44:32]: Do any family maybe

@Trent [44:35]: Yeah, let me check Promotions Spam No Didn't get capped in spam I don't know, it's just taking a little while

@Chris Andrade [44:48]: What do you guys

@Trent [44:51]: Any anyway, so What we need to do is we need to clarify our deliverables, we have a challenge in timing with quo. But we need to get on the hook with Quo and get them to explain it to us so that we can get that taken care of ASAP.

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [45:10]: Oh Offer and payment, right? so deliverables. Yeah, you wanna finish going in with the the liberals and what that kind of looks like, or like what we, we could dial in on that at least, right?

@Trent [45:21]: Yeah Yeah, I, well, I mean, OK, so there's a couple things we could do to do that, right? Is that we can just sit on this call and we can just punch it out right now.

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [45:24]: For free.

@Trent [45:33]: Or we could take the information that we have from our transcript today and try to dial it in using that information, if we want to, OK? Yeah, that's pretty much like

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [45:47]: I think it would be wise I haven't gone through the transcripts yet, but I think it would be wise to use a lot of that information, or most of that information. It would be dumb not to, right?

@Trent [45:55]: Yeah, I think, I think go for that, yeah. So use the So the best The best source of the deliverables that I have right now is gonna be in that Either the execution plan or the quick win proposal.

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [46:14]: Mhm

@Trent [46:14]: So you, you have these documents, it just looks different to you right here, OK?

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [46:17]: Mhm.

@Trent [46:18]: But the, the quick win proposal, it's in the Google Drive.

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [46:22]: OK.

@Trent [46:22]: Right? So this was sort of spelling out the deliverables, but we'll have to dial them in

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [46:28]: OK

@Trent [46:28]: And if I look at execution plan, execution plan is how we would intend on executing on the quick win proposal.

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [46:38]: Got you

@Trent [46:39]: OK.

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [46:39]: So the execution plan comes from the Pucoin proposal. Go, yep.

@Trent [46:42]: Yeah, Quin is supposed to be a summarized version to propose to the client. Execution plan, which if they say how are you going to do it? That's the plan, but that's also what we try to execute off of.

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [46:46]: Thanks, bye.

@Trent [46:56]: Like that's what we intend on trying to use as our guide to get there.

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [46:56]: Yeah OK. Do you think, do you think it would be wise to take the, the transcripts again and run them through the process, and now that we know information, new information, run it through the process again.

@Matthew Kerns [47:01]: Cool.

@Trent [47:09]: Yeah Yep, and

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [47:12]: And then see what it comes up with.

@Trent [47:12]: Yup And then ask Claude to give us alignment, like

@Matthew Kerns [47:14]: What

@Trent [47:18]: Point the point claw to these files.

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [47:21]: Mhm.

@Trent [47:21]: And say, can you look at this transcript, pull out all the information, and look for alignment in our quick win proposal, right?

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [47:29]: Gotcha

@Trent [47:29]: So, that's the way, that's the way I would approach it.

@Matthew Kerns [47:30]: Yeah, that's one

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [47:33]: Perfect. And then

@Matthew Kerns [47:33]: And I was thinking that there's a separation, so the sales OS is going to have the proposal generation and then the development OS is going to have more of the execution plan, but we can do it whatever way we want. That's just what I'm thinking. But also I wanted to ask where it, where you said mentioned this is in the Google Drive, which, which Google Drive folder is it?

@Trent [47:54]: Go to, go to the Google Drive by Mikel. Right here, so

@Matthew Kerns [48:01]: So it's sales.

@Trent [48:03]: Yeah.

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [48:03]: Should be aroused group sales of us.

@Matthew Kerns [48:06]: Here group sales, OK.

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [48:10]: And then under lea

@Matthew Kerns [48:10]: Oh, and then under lease Got it. OK

@Trent [48:14]: Yeah, so just one, this one right here, go to Leeds.

@Matthew Kerns [48:14]: Process

@Trent [48:18]: Water mechanic

@Matthew Kerns [48:18]: Of

@Trent [48:19]: And then it's in offer Yeah

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [48:23]: Yeah Yeah.

@Trent [48:25]: Execution plan. There's the offer framework, the offer framework is basically what I got from Acquisition AI.

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [48:27]: That one

@Trent [48:34]: The execution plan in the Quickrim proposal were derived from that. I just, I told

@Matthew Kerns [48:34]: OK

@Trent [48:41]: Acquisition AI listen, I don't want to give them the full plan right now. I just want to give them the quick win. And that's what I got out of it, was the quick win. So basically the way it is is like big picture is the plotter ops. Big picture, right? Ongoing relationship,

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [48:58]: Yeah

@Trent [49:01]: Quick win proposals, the small first phase.

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [49:02]: Yeah.

@Trent [49:05]: And execution plan is how we plan to execute on it.

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [49:08]: Got it

@Matthew Kerns [49:09]: OK. So I'm thinking to pull in the trans pull in these files to myOS, explained that

@Trent [49:10]: Right

@Matthew Kerns [49:18]: And basically say, OK, we now have this new meeting transcript. I want to pull this new context and update the offer framework, and then basically,

@Trent [49:18]: Yeah

@Matthew Kerns [49:31]: The quick win proposal, I, I'll probably explain exactly this to Claude, like, we'll keep the quick win proposal very similar, and I want an updated execution plan for a phase 1 and a quick follow phase 2 with Sort of like a stretch goal in there and see what comes up with.

@Trent [49:49]: Yeah Yeah, go for it. I, I love it. I love the plane, that's it, that's, yeah. So open to any input from the rest of the team, but I think that's, you know, that's kind of the approach I was thinking.

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [50:01]: OK.

@Matthew Kerns [50:02]: Cool.

@Trent [50:02]: Build upon this, but feeding in our latest information to try to see if we can just sort of give it the little tweaks that we need to make sure that we can deliver. Just don't forget the piece that we wanna, we wanna kill it, right? So, if you want to give it a stretch goal, go for it. But at the end of the day, I think if we overdeliver on time,

@Trent [50:21]: It's probably more valuable

@Matthew Kerns [50:23]: Yeah, for sure, cause that accelerates us to like

@Trent [50:27]: The next stage

@Matthew Kerns [50:27]: The, the closer Yeah, the next stage of the quicker testimonial, the better testimonial, like if we just blow him out of the water with value quicker,

@Trent [50:37]: Mhm

@Matthew Kerns [50:39]: Yeah

@Trent [50:39]: Yeah, I think that's the way to do it. I think that Chris was on point there. I was going the other way, but I think that I'm convinced that all of us are on page with Nail it on the quick win. Let's just not even offer them anything else. Tell them there is something else, it's coming, but

@Trent [50:56]: We're not offering anything

@Matthew Kerns [50:58]: Yeah, cause we've built trust, we just want to build upon that with value delivery and our advantage with all four of us is speed. Like we can do things fast because we've all teamed up. If we were all

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [50:59]: OK

@Trent [51:09]: And we don't have anything else going on. I mean, we have other things going on, but not really, right?

@Matthew Kerns [51:15]: Yeah, we have enough capacity to deliver quickly on this project, and yeah, we're this, we're in a good spot.

@Chris Andrade [51:22]: Right.

@Matthew Kerns [51:22]: Loving this.

@Chris Andrade [51:23]: That you touch it on capacity, which we also got to take into consideration that Trent's gonna be gone from the 24th to the 4th, right?

@Trent [51:33]: I'll, I'll do whatever I can to help, but I will be working 12-hour days in a factory, and I won't be able to do much for Basically the holiday to the 4th.

@Matthew Kerns [51:46]: Yeah

@Chris Andrade [51:46]: So we gotta, we gotta That maybe we can.

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [51:49]: Is she walking If we lock in a proposal, say by like Friday to get everything signed and done and just say we'll deliver by the end of January. That still puts us like we Yeah, like we, we should have like enough time, I feel like, you know.

@Chris Andrade [52:04]: I think so too. That, that's the way to go because everybody's busy during the holidays, including myself, that we just say, hey, we'll get started in the very beginning of the year, and we'll deliver by February 1st.

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [52:04]: I

@Chris Andrade [52:16]: But I, I actuality we're already building it. It's just At our pace and when the clock really starts. So technically we're getting like a two-week jump ahead.

@Matthew Kerns [52:22]: Yes

@Trent [52:25]: Yeah We're we're gonna, we're gonna tell them that we're going to start on it January, but in reality, we will be working on it now and then, so, yeah.

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [52:36]: No head start

@Trent [52:37]: So.

@Matthew Kerns [52:39]: We also need the, I don't know how that's gonna work with data collection because we need to start data collection as soon as possible, like. This week if possible or next

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [52:50]: That would be to knock out as much of it as possible in kickoff section and I think if, if we know from what it is exactly what we need based off the delivery rules, if you give Me that, me and Chris can extract that from him and relay that back to you guys. I think that's how we should.

@Matthew Kerns [53:06]: So when you So we need access to emails, we need access to Joer And we need inventory, when you start gathering inventory data.

@Trent [53:17]: Let's, let's Definitely take note of those, but let's make sure we thought through everything very well. Let's get the deliverables from what we dial in with Claude, then we'll take what you just said as our shortlist, and then I think there's some things that we probably need to make sure we put on there too.

@Trent [53:35]: And then we'll

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [53:37]: Yeah, it's a kickoff how we schedule with them like an hour, hour and a half at, like at least just to get. Like going, you know So we, so we don't have to play that tag, that phone tag.

@Trent [53:44]: Yeah We don't wanna do one contact Good, Chris

@Chris Andrade [53:50]: Can I say very quick, is there a way, Matthew, when you were just walking through the refinement of the 2nd iteration of our interview. At the end, when you're talking about your stretch goal. Can you also ask it to give us a list of prerequisites or prerequisite requirements for a list of what we're gonna need and then let's attach that to the deliverable, and say, hey, so this is what

@Chris Andrade [54:20]: We're delivering, just so you know, in the same time, can you start gathering the information, so that's like, that's not surprise them. Hey, we also need this and expect the result that day. Let's just give them the what we need at the same time of the deliverable at the contract.

@Chris Andrade [54:40]: And set that expectation and then say, hey, We would like to have this by Monday. Is that possible?

@Trent [54:47]: Yeah

@Chris Andrade [54:47]: And give them a time That we give them, OK, we need a list. You got 4 days together and then it gives us the ability to assess them to see, OK, are they gonna we gave them a task to do in 4 days on a scale the task is really not that hard, so they should be able to get it done. And if they don't, then that puts a flag up in our system. We're like, OK, well, their tendencies

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [54:56]: Perfect

@Chris Andrade [55:14]: Cause delays Which we need to contingency that the contingency factor when we go to the next iteration of the next phase of the next compulsion. You're not

@Trent [55:24]: Oh yeah

@Chris Andrade [55:25]: Predicting.

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [55:26]: I like that. I really like that.

@Trent [55:27]: After this first phase of how the client works, right?

@Chris Andrade [55:31]: Like that though. I really like But if they could just Get, if we could just get that set of notion, right, with the deliverables, but the same, you know, where you're gonna write or run through the prompt, just add that section about the requirements that we're going to need to request and then

@Chris Andrade [55:48]: Use that to build off of, you know.

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [55:51]: Beautiful.

@Trent [55:51]: Yeah. Matthew knows what we're talking about

@Matthew Kerns [55:55]: Yep

@Trent [55:55]: He's he's got it under control

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [55:59]: Yeah, that's, I think we're on point, guys. I think I really think we're on point. I think that I, I wish they met us before they met the other dude, but like, I, I think we sold them, and I think they're in a great spot. I, I know them. I know them yeah.

@Trent [56:11]: Yeah, yeah So.

@Chris Andrade [56:14]: I was supposed to happen, my guy. They were supposed to go through all that. They were supposed to see how fucking difficult it is working with these guys and then, you know what that does for us though. Like it turns, we get to

@Chris Andrade [56:30]: Exactly

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [56:30]: Like the

@Chris Andrade [56:32]: Actually, I'd like, these are the per like when I go into a contract here or if I go to a remodel and they say the same shit, it honestly makes it my job easier because I already know what not to do, you know, and so then it gives me, and now I make sure that I'm hitting those pain points that they had with the other guy, and I make sure that I'm addressing those right from the very beginning. So then we are, we're not giving

@Trent [56:32]: Yeah.

@Chris Andrade [57:02]: Them any type of wiggle room for the mind to wander on, you know.

@Trent [57:07]: Yep Yeah. So if we can get just dial in the deliverables. I'll dial in, I'll dial in the contract. OK? So we can have that ready and queued up. Mikel, I will need information if, if we're doing this through a rise group, if we're doing it all throughI group, then I need to put your information as the

@Trent [57:27]: You know, the primary party, and then I'll let him fill out his information. Like I can leave it blank. I could actually leave ours blank too, and you can just fill it out.

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [57:29]: Yep, got you. I'll send that over. OK. Yeah, either or. However, however you want it, just let me know.

@Trent [57:41]: Get blank and I'll just have you be like the first person I can think I can put it in order. So I'll have you be the first person and then it'll pass to him. But we'll have to relay the message to him. Once we dial this in, we'll have to communicate with him, which that might be the time when we say, hey, here's the things we need, but also, I'm going to send you over the contract, right?

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [57:46]: OK.

@Trent [58:02]: And then we can take payment here. That's kind of how I, I think it should work probably. Hey, here's, here's the list of things we need. We're going to send you a contract and payment.

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [58:08]: 100%. I I agree. And then also for payment, I was thinking either, I don't know, like check AC, I don't know, I'm doing the QuickBooks thing, but I should be ready. I got the bank account set up yesterday, and

@Trent [58:24]: Yeah

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [58:26]: However

@Chris Andrade [58:27]: So I, you know, I say let's just make it painless. I, like, let's say they, I, if we get a check, I can just take that check and go to your bank and to all I need is your account number

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [58:27]: Didn't want

@Chris Andrade [58:40]: I can actually just deposit that right into your bank.

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [58:40]: Yeah.

@Chris Andrade [58:43]: And it'll be right then and there immediately.

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [58:46]: Easy

@Trent [58:47]: Yeah, I mean, that, that, that should be reasonably possible because when you're doing deposits, they don't really care.

@Chris Andrade [58:53]: Yeah, exactly. You're not, I'm not taking money. I'm just putting money in there. So I, that's what I do. I

@Trent [58:58]: Yeah It's chase so the overwhere.

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [59:03]: Yeah

@Chris Andrade [59:04]: Yeah, exactly. I live right next door to one. So,

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [59:07]: Saying

@Chris Andrade [59:08]: There was I, I didn't want to interrupt you, but now I've lost my fucking thought it.

@Trent [59:15]: Sorry, we interrupted you.

@Chris Andrade [59:17]: No, no, it's fine. I, Yeah, oh Can we figure out, to get our emails set up with all the right domains.

@Trent [59:30]: Let's, that's a good idea

@Chris Andrade [59:30]: All of us have our name with

@Trent [59:32]: That's a good idea. What does everybody have as far as their email provider in the business side, not a personal side.

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [59:39]: I'm, I'm using Google

@Chris Andrade [59:41]: Go down or

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [59:42]: For.

@Matthew Kerns [59:43]: Yeah, I like Google the best

@Chris Andrade [59:44]: But, but But Remember, I don't know who are you using for your domain, Miguel?

@Trent [59:51]: It

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [59:52]: My domain

@Chris Andrade [59:52]: Oh

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [59:54]: I'm hosting it through Hostinger

@Trent [59:55]: Yeah, so hosting hostinger is easy to set up.

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [59:56]: But I

@Trent [59:58]: So you, you probably already experienced that. It's pretty easy.

@Chris Andrade [59:59]: Yep. Yeah

@Trent [1:00:04]: So

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [1:00:05]: I'm confused cause I'm using Google Workspace, and I, I think I, I'm using the Google email, but I know hostinger offers emails, maybe that's it.

@Trent [1:00:15]: Works is the email on the backside, your email like is through Google. But Google Hostinger, hostinger links into Google and that email address just basically gets passed into Google.

@Trent [1:00:32]: It gives Google permission Permission to use your domain.

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [1:00:38]: Right

@Chris Andrade [1:00:39]: Because to be honest, I need business cards if I'm being straight up, that's why. And I was just like those business cards to have our group.

@Trent [1:00:39]: OK

@Chris Andrade [1:00:48]: On there

@Trent [1:00:48]: So So here's the thing, when I was just having a quick chat with Claude about how to do this. We don't have to get a business Google account that we're all on right this minute, right? So Google lets you put alternate domains.

@Trent [1:01:04]: I don't know if you

@Chris Andrade [1:01:04]: Oh

@Trent [1:01:05]: Should. So you can pick two domains for your business email So I can have Trent at 40hero.com and trent at Arisegroup.com or .au. So I can

@Chris Andrade [1:01:20]: AI

@Trent [1:01:21]: I can have both from the same box, the same box I send an email, and there's a dropdown on the email address that you're sending to. OK, or sending

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [1:01:30]: We do that for a right group with temperatures and we can work around having to pay for it right now. That's, that's, that's a true integrator. That's why.

@Trent [1:01:37]: Yeah, that's what I'm, that's. That's what

@Chris Andrade [1:01:42]: Yeah

@Trent [1:01:44]: That's what I'm trying to work through is that if I understand that, you know, we're all on Google, but as Chris, you said you're using what?

@Chris Andrade [1:01:53]: Google as well

@Trent [1:01:54]: For business, right? Everybody's using it for business?

@Matthew Kerns [1:01:58]: I have one, my business email account is through Zohomail.

@Chris Andrade [1:01:58]: Yeah.

@Matthew Kerns [1:02:03]: Cause I don't know why the fuck I did it, but I also have a Gmail one that I could use, that's Could be better, but if we can find a way for the Zohon.

@Trent [1:02:10]: Is it

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [1:02:11]: Business

@Trent [1:02:13]: OK. Yeah, so let's work through that. I don't know, we might go do the same thing with other providers. I just only checked Google because I didn't know what we had. So you said Zou?

@Matthew Kerns [1:02:25]: Soho Yeah, only the Zoil because

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [1:02:26]: Another would another option.

@Matthew Kerns [1:02:29]: It's like, it gives you like multiple emails, but maybe I can even just move it, like to Google, so whatever works.

@Trent [1:02:37]: I mean, I don't know what else you have on there. It's totally up to you how you want to do it, but if you move it to Google, I mean, you're going to be paying, if you're paying Zoho Email, are you paying for that

@Matthew Kerns [1:02:47]: No, it's free

@Trent [1:02:49]: Google Google Workspaces will cost you something.

@Chris Andrade [1:02:53]: Yeah

@Trent [1:02:53]: So you'll, you'll have an added cost. So we can try to go down the aisle.

@Chris Andrade [1:02:57]: Yeah, I did play like $17. I got for, I got 5 gigs and a business deal for 17, it was like a it was a promotion. That's why I jumped on it.

@Trent [1:03:09]: Yeah, so I mean if we're, if you want to try to go the other route where we can try to keep it free for you. We can try to go down Zoho and see if we can put in an alternate domain, but I don't know if we can or not. Otherwise,

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [1:03:20]: What

@Trent [1:03:22]: You know

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [1:03:22]: Possibly just buy another domain and, and attach it to it. The reser

@Trent [1:03:26]: That it's not really the domain that's the problem. It's the domain it's whether or not the email provider, the email host allowed. Yeah.

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [1:03:29]: Oh, it's the, the email is. Gotcha

@Chris Andrade [1:03:34]: Say this, I, my hosting because I have that agency. I bought that agency starter package. I get 100 free emails for the first year. I get 100 free email accounts set up.

@Trent [1:03:45]: Oh, yep OK, but what Yeah, so that might work too. That might help too. So let's Let, let, I'll work through that one.

@Chris Andrade [1:03:55]: Let OK

@Matthew Kerns [1:03:57]: What's the end objective? Do we all have the same domain, that we put on business cards. OK. OK, so then, well, my, the one that I was talking about through Zoho is Matthew aticodemyussiness.com, so it's my own domain that's not going to be one, like we're gonna, that's not the objective, I think.

@Trent [1:04:04]: Yeah, that's So no, but what I'm saying is that I have 40hero.com, but I can add a second, so I can have two domains, same email

@Trent [1:04:27]: 2 domains

@Matthew Kerns [1:04:29]: Hm, OK

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [1:04:29]: Google provide you to that's why, that's why he's saying cause my second one I used as like an infoAdderized group or whatever, but instead I could just change that

@Trent [1:04:32]: Mhm.

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [1:04:37]: Or I, I would actually, can I give that one, can I give one to Trent if, if, or no, that's not how it works.

@Matthew Kerns [1:04:38]: Oh

@Trent [1:04:42]: So, so when you add a new user You're going to have to

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [1:04:48]: A, yeah

@Trent [1:04:48]: Pay for an additional user, but you can create email aliases, so you can have info at rigroup. AI, OK? I have like one that's called Demo. I have one that's info. I have one that's, I don't know, they're just aliases though. They all come to the same box, but the domain is the same.

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [1:05:09]: Got it

@Trent [1:05:10]: The domains the same, but my understanding, I haven't done it. My understanding is Google lets you put a second domain. You can do, you can do two domains.

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [1:05:21]: Got it.

@Trent [1:05:21]: On Google You could probably do more

@Matthew Kerns [1:05:24]: With the Does it have to be the same first one cause I, I do have a Google one that's like support at Infinityaultcars.com. So if I wanted to do at a rise group. Could I do Matthew at a ris group?

@Trent [1:05:35]: I don't know I mean, that would be, you know, I feel like that would be ideal, but I don't know. I don't, yeah, we'll have to work through this. I think one at a time, right?

@Matthew Kerns [1:05:43]: Yeah Yep, sounds good

@Trent [1:05:47]: So what, what email options do you have right now? You have Matthew

@Matthew Kerns [1:05:53]: Me, I have one Google email through one another business, and then I have one email that's For I code my business.com, with Zoho mail.

@Trent [1:06:08]: OK. All right. And do you know that the other one, the Google one, that's for another business, is that Workspaces or is that something else? Are you, are you paying for it

@Matthew Kerns [1:06:21]: I think it was free, but it might be through like Wick or something. I'm not sure if I migrated it because I did migrate that domain to like name cheap, so it might be there now.

@Matthew Kerns [1:06:38]: I think the emails go through there now for the Domain of

@Trent [1:06:43]: Yeah, there's a Gmail business account. Hold on. Get started Get the whole business account. We don't have to do this on the call, but I can, I can look into it a little bit and I can just go back and forth with you, Matthew. I would like

@Chris Andrade [1:06:55]: Yeah. They

@Trent [1:07:00]: Yeah, go ahead. Go ahead.

@Chris Andrade [1:07:04]: Sorry, go ahead I was just gonna ask Mikha, do you have a vectored image of the logo, or is it just a JPEG

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [1:07:13]: It's a JPEG. I need to get, how do I do that? Actually

@Trent [1:07:18]: Where did you get the label

@Chris Andrade [1:07:18]: Give And I, I got Adobe Illustrator that I can convert it over to a vector file.

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [1:07:26]: OK, I'll show it to you, I'll shoot it in the WhatsApp group.

@Chris Andrade [1:07:29]: OK, and then I'll, I'll convert it over. you could actually, I've done it, it comes out a little wonky, but yeah, just send it to me. I'll I'll get it. I'll I'll convert it over.

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [1:07:40]: OK.

@Chris Andrade [1:07:44]: Yeah, I have the Adobe Suite, so I have all of the Adobe products

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [1:07:50]: Nice What do you guys think about that one? That's, that's my favorite so far. I don't

@Trent [1:07:56]: What's that?

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [1:07:57]: I'm just trying to. It's not important, but yeah, I feel like I, I, I like that one But I agree we could get dialed in on the The email stuff so we could get business cards. And Yama, I'm, I'm excited.

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [1:08:14]: I'm so hyped to help these guys

@Trent [1:08:14]: Yeah Yeah, just get it started, man. Get it started.

@Matthew Kerns [1:08:19]: Yep, so I'm super hyped as well.

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [1:08:23]: If you're talking

@Chris Andrade [1:08:24]: I can't believe he converted him. I seriously thought we were going to, I was like, I was like sad at first cause I saw her face and I was like, oh my gosh. And then I, we turned it around and Yeah, dude, I, I

@Trent [1:08:35]: Was

@Chris Andrade [1:08:38]: I

@Trent [1:08:38]: Hey man, you're her own. I could hear her tone. It was, she came in and.

@Chris Andrade [1:08:38]: Didn't think we're

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [1:08:40]: She did come a lot.

@Chris Andrade [1:08:42]: Far this fast, to be honest, like this is crazy.

@Trent [1:08:45]: Yeah. Yeah

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [1:08:47]: She came in hot, but she left, she left school.

@Trent [1:08:48]: Yeah, she was ready to say no So Anyway, OK, I'll, I'll look into this email situation, if If Matthew wants to get started and then if Mikel has, wants to get involved with trying to figure out how to process this transcript and inject it in there, go for it.

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [1:09:06]: Yeah Yeah

@Trent [1:09:08]: All right? You guys can work together on that one if you want to. Unless you think there's something else you don't work on that happen.

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [1:09:08]: Yeah Yeah, he, we No, no, no, 100% already before even this meeting I hit up Matthew and I told him to look me in on that. So I think bringing in the transcripts and processing it is definitely gonna, should be on the sale side. If I'm gonna pick up how he does that, shoot it through the process, and then I can share it out with the group. I say we shoot to have a proposal to him and get paid by Friday. I think like take today and tomorrow the rest of today and tomorrow to think through it, prepare, and make sure it's all good. And then Friday morning, we can get them signed in, imported. And then, and then also ideally

@Trent [1:09:19]: Yeah Yeah.

@Trent [1:09:37]: I Yup

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [1:09:43]: To what Chris was saying earlier, to schedule a kickoff call when, when, so like, exactly what Trump said, I think this is what we're gonna need This is what we're gonna need the contract and then

@Trent [1:09:56]: Payment, right? Yeah, so, yeah, our, our list of you need to give us stuff, right? to water mechanics, the contract signed and the payment, and then we can have, we can schedule that kickoff call where we're ready to just hit the ground running sometime in January, right?

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [1:09:56]: Get paid. That's how we're doing the payment. Yup They're right, yeah

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [1:10:12]: E Yup. And in order to get that stuff, we gotta process all the, the new stuff, so we'll get going on that.

@Trent [1:10:19]: Yeah.

@Matthew Kerns [1:10:19]: And the, the axis as soon as possible so that as soon as we're ready, we can start You know,

@Chris Andrade [1:10:26]: So,

@Matthew Kerns [1:10:27]: Integrating Doing there actually

@Chris Andrade [1:10:29]: Two things then If we, I can to make sure to ensure I know we're going to give them our January 1st start date, but hey, Chris would like to see if he can come over on Monday Just to make sure that the passwords or emails, if there's any issues, ICANN ultimately walk through those issues physically and not have to rely on a phone or anything like that, you know, I think that would be

@Chris Andrade [1:10:57]: Really good for us.

@Trent [1:10:58]: Yeah And I can be on the hook or I can be on the hook digitally, where if we need to, I can just, we can do a remote link where they just click a link in the email and

@Chris Andrade [1:11:00]: And OK

@Trent [1:11:08]: Help with that

@Chris Andrade [1:11:09]: Hey OK, and, and then

@Matthew Kerns [1:11:11]: Let's definitely do that, but Chris, I think when you're doing that, we want to have you on a Google Meet, and we fathom record it so we can make an SOP for how we're going to do it remotely in the future.

@Chris Andrade [1:11:22]: Yep, yep, and then also, this is something like this is.

@Trent [1:11:22]: OK cool I too

@Chris Andrade [1:11:27]: The, the easier we can make this onboarding problem or onboarding process, the easier we can get or send out for more leads, right? So I would like for us to take what we're doing right now and ultimately let's see, let's start figuring out how can we send this onboarding process in a link like we discussed from the very beginning, and just keep that in the back of our minds because I, I like, I got 5

@Trent [1:11:38]: Yup.

@Chris Andrade [1:11:57]: People right now who are waiting for that link. And and ultimately for to test that link out and how that function works, right? So I, I'm not promising any day time or anything. I'm just saying.

@Trent [1:12:06]: What length are you, what length are you talking about?

@Chris Andrade [1:12:10]: To get more leads if we can develop that, it would be, it would go a long way.

@Trent [1:12:14]: What link are you talking about? What is the link for?

@Chris Andrade [1:12:17]: Like, The link that we would send to somebody to start the onboarding process like the questions, the interviewing, you know, for us to, to ultimately give them that The question, the 5 question framework to respond to in a recording.

@Trent [1:12:30]: Yeah. That's on the website there

@Chris Andrade [1:12:38]: I know, but how do we have a way to record and capture. And send back

@Trent [1:12:45]: Well, yeah, it's a, it's a user form, so someone clicks the link and then they answer the questions and then we get the response.

@Chris Andrade [1:12:53]: Oh, so it like we, we can send the link right now and they can record their responses.

@Trent [1:12:59]: We'll have the responses in a database.

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [1:13:00]: Not, not a link in the way you're talking about, but if they visit the website and ask for help or whatever, if there, like, it would ask him the 5 questions and collect their information and all that.

@Trent [1:13:12]: Yeah, on the website

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [1:13:12]: And then going to see that

@Trent [1:13:13]: Yeah, on the website, any CTA, any any call to action button, I think, goes to the form that the 5 questions, and then it will take their information, their responses, and it puts it into a database. The only thing I think we're lacking there is we don't necessarily have a good way to get notified when that stuff goes in immediately, I don't think, do we?

@Chris Andrade [1:13:16]: OK Right. OK

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [1:13:37]: No

@Matthew Kerns [1:13:38]: No.

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [1:13:38]: Not yet

@Trent [1:13:39]: That's what we need to actually

@Chris Andrade [1:13:41]: I guess that's what I mean like let's start seeing, like, let's start thinking of those things to start dialing that system in ultimately so we can start getting more leads to come through the funnel is ultimately what I'm trying to

@Trent [1:13:55]: Yep.

@Chris Andrade [1:13:57]: To achieve

@Matthew Kerns [1:13:57]: Yeah

@Trent [1:13:59]: I think we can just figure out how to tie in a notification that will probably get us Most of the work.

@Chris Andrade [1:14:04]: OK All right. Hey, I just, I just got home and the girls are, I gotta get, I got it.

@Matthew Kerns [1:14:06]: Yeah

@Trent [1:14:12]: Yeah. Gotcha

@Chris Andrade [1:14:12]: I gotta go. I'll call you back

@Trent [1:14:13]: OK. See ya

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [1:14:15]: Later

@Matthew Kerns [1:14:17]: See ya

@Trent [1:14:18]: Yeah, so lots of things there, right? So

@Matthew Kerns [1:14:19]: So Yeah I already started processing the stuff. I did the stuff that I said about pulling in the offer framework in this quick win proposal and stuff. So I paused that so I can kind of like

@Matthew Kerns [1:14:39]: You know, get it on a call. So maybe I don't know if we end this huddle, and then we do a new call whenever you're ready, Mika, if you wanna do that together. I don't know if Trent, if you want to be there too, definitely. And then we've, I'm trying to put together the, the, the initial deliverables.

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [1:15:01]: OK Yeah, we can stop, this huddle. I gotta step out for like 30, 40 minutes, and I'll be back on my computer But 4:30ish, Eastern like 45 minutes, but yeah. We can

@Matthew Kerns [1:15:17]: Sounds good

@Trent [1:15:18]: OK. I'm, I'm just trying to take notes by putting him in. I already sent one message, but it wasn't complete, so anyway, in this chat right here of like kind of the things we talked about just a bullet pointed list.

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [1:15:26]: One next Proposal to deliver your request will find. Way to get paid. Perfect But yeah, easy. I'll, I'll see you guys in a bit. Matthew, I'll I'll, I'll shoot you, I'll ping you when I, as soon as I get back.

@Matthew Kerns [1:15:38]: Yeah Sounds good, buddy

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [1:15:45]: You know, later

@Matthew Kerns [1:15:45]: And then, yeah, no this, but yeah, see you guys.

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [1:15:49]: Better shot

@Trent [1:15:50]: Yup, see yup

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [1:15:50]: Yes

@Trent [1:15:56]: So 11 day. Because the

@Trent [1:16:15]: Posing

@Trent [1:16:48]: And once we get this process, like dialed in, we can start to automate it too, right?

@Matthew Kerns [1:16:56]: Yeah, I'm sorry, which process though?

@Trent [1:16:58]: So like, what you're doing right now, Once we have that dialed in, and then Mikkel said that, you know, that should be on the sales side, and I agree they should have the tool that they need to execute this. Once we have it

@Matthew Kerns [1:17:11]: Yeah.

@Trent [1:17:12]: Like Like just knowing what the steps are, right? And having the core That you are using, right? Whatever you're prompting the agent, whatever files are relative to it. Whatever that stack looks like.

@Trent [1:17:28]: We can try to package it up somehow and give it

@Matthew Kerns [1:17:29]: Yeah

@Trent [1:17:33]: A way that they can talk to it, that they can execute that.

@Matthew Kerns [1:17:35]: Yeah I think a good way would be the chat hub, so we

@Trent [1:17:41]: I know, me too. I was thinking the exact same thing. I don't know if it's the best for our end users yet, right? But for our purposes, it will help us be able to build these little agents quickly for ourselves.

@Matthew Kerns [1:17:41]: Yeah Yeah, so we can build these agent, the agent that does this intake stuff, and then like Mikhail can just chat with it, and then pretty soon Chris will be able to chat with it and like

@Matthew Kerns [1:18:07]: Just automate the whole thing

@Trent [1:18:10]: Yeah, that's kind of what I had in my mind, I'll see, I had the To go Here. I moved it. OK, here Yeah, so inside the chat interface, I don't know if you like what you paid attention to in the video, but you can just, you can turn these off, these, these, all these different ones that are in here.

@Trent [1:18:37]: On my show and my screen. OK. you can turn all these this dropdown off, right? And you can just do custom agents, or custom agents are right here.

@Matthew Kerns [1:18:38]: Mhm. Yep

@Trent [1:18:47]: And We can just have like the Meeting transcript agent or something, right?

@Matthew Kerns [1:18:55]: Yeah

@Trent [1:18:55]: Or the sale, the sales proposal agent or what have you, whatever the The task or role is. We can assign an agent that we create and then N8N on the backside does the The heavy lifting

@Matthew Kerns [1:19:11]: Yeah, I know what I would like is Basic like I, I already feel like we have so many slack huddle meetings that I just haven't put into my OS and like I would love it if that could get automated, so like, it just, I just can chat with it and be like, hey, just had a slack meeting.

@Matthew Kerns [1:19:31]: I mean, even that we can automate away and have it automatically do that, but for now, like, first step is probably just If we can set up where we can say, hey, just had a slack huddle, you know, can you make sure that that meeting is captured in my OS and then have it connect to my OS and update documents there with like a prompt that's

@Matthew Kerns [1:19:56]: Basically templated

@Trent [1:19:58]: Yeah Yep, and we need to know like what that looks like, right? And what the final store, what like what we need to do with it and where we're finally, the final resting place is, right? And then what the output is, what we're expecting to come back to the user or

@Matthew Kerns [1:19:59]: And Yeah

@Trent [1:20:13]: What's the, what's the outcome? Once we have that dialed in, then we can just we can automate it pretty quick. It's like, what's the input and we're making a request. We can, I mean, I can dial that in pretty quickly, to be honest. I can probably go get it to where we have an N8N flow.

@Trent [1:20:32]: That can go and get our slack huddles from the last day. Or we give it a time frame and it goes and gets it for us. But then where do I, what do I do with it after that?

@Matthew Kerns [1:20:41]: That's

@Trent [1:20:43]: Is the question

@Matthew Kerns [1:20:44]: Yeah, yeah. I mean, what What I'm using right now is the Cloud CotoS, but yeah, we don't know the final resting place. I heard on my call yesterday that notion AI is pretty good at plugging into a bunch of things, so it's potentially an option, but it's just, there's so many options, right?

@Trent [1:21:02]: I'm, I'm, yeah, I have, I have not in AI and I, we can work with it, and, but I don't think you have access to it. If you click on the link, the notion link, you have an open perchance or do you have a quick access to it?

@Matthew Kerns [1:21:14]: Yeah, yeah, I have, I have it open.

@Trent [1:21:17]: Does it give you the little AI bubble in the bottom right hand corner.

@Matthew Kerns [1:21:22]: I don't see one, but.

@Trent [1:21:23]: This here

@Matthew Kerns [1:21:25]: It says

@Trent [1:21:26]: In my

@Matthew Kerns [1:21:27]: So I clicked on, I just clicked on, I'll look at your screen in a second, but I just clicked on home and it says Experience notion as a Workspace member. And it says where I can request access. We create an organized projects, notes, and to dos, stay in the loop, supercharge work with the latest notion features, so that might be how I get it.

@Trent [1:21:45]: Well, yeah, for a price. That's the problem. That's, that's the big one right there is that I've been thinking about, you know, if we can get this first sale, like we get locked in. I'm thinking about dumping money into a couple tools, like notion, just so that we all have access to the full notion to, to work together.

@Matthew Kerns [1:21:48]: OK Yeah

@Trent [1:22:05]: Because we have, I think, I think notion is key to being able to give us a central place that we can

@Matthew Kerns [1:22:06]: Yeah

@Trent [1:22:12]: Work together

@Matthew Kerns [1:22:15]: I think that sounds good, cause it's all connected. It's a good interface where for even non-technical people and technical people,

@Trent [1:22:24]: Mhm

@Matthew Kerns [1:22:25]: Yeah, I mean, for now I'm just using the OS, the cloud CotoS just to organize my own thoughts, but yeah, I like that.

@Trent [1:22:32]: Well The way the way that this looks is that there is multiple locations of like truth. OK. Your cloud code OS can reside somewhere. Let's say GitHub.

@Matthew Kerns [1:22:41]: OK. Mhm

@Trent [1:22:47]: That can be a source of truth. It does not need to be in notion to be the source of truth. Notion is just the window.

@Matthew Kerns [1:22:55]: Got it, right

@Trent [1:22:57]: It's just bri it's surfacing things that are important to us.

@Matthew Kerns [1:22:57]: Makes sense.

@Trent [1:23:02]: And then if you want to

@Matthew Kerns [1:23:02]: Yeah, so

@Trent [1:23:04]: Go ahead

@Matthew Kerns [1:23:04]: So maybe development OS like me and you are comfortable with keeping that in cloud code and then notion just surfaces just as the window to that for the sales side if they need it.

@Trent [1:23:16]: Yeah, no notion will be the window for whatever department, whether that that's you and I, like I'll have my own ability to look at things. You'll have your own ability to look at things, and it may be all encompassing across all departments, or it might be project specific, or it might just be you, right? So, we can filter all that stuff through databases.

@Matthew Kerns [1:23:34]: Mhm

@Trent [1:23:39]: So, I mean, notion as databases, we can ask AI like you get access, that's what I'm showing up now to. There's this is AI so you can summarize the page. So if I just click summarize the page. It's, it's going through everything in this page right now, and it's going to summarize it for us. So that's just like a really simple, you know, thing that it can do. So if we actually were to look at it, says this page serves as a central hub for the AAA team. Team infrastructure, immediate actions, proposal agenda, that's the thing at the bottom, right? Proposal agenda. but anyway, there's lots of things you can do with this cause you can add files, you can change.

@Matthew Kerns [1:23:52]: Yeah

@Trent [1:24:17]: It can see globally, so you can actually, you can have it search GitHub. You can have a search Google Drive.

@Matthew Kerns [1:24:22]: Mhm.

@Trent [1:24:25]: You can have it Web search And there's other, there's other ways that it can search stuff too. So I guess what I'm saying is that

@Matthew Kerns [1:24:33]: More apps, and then, man, I almost wonder like if we're gonna be using this What's why like maybe long term for the clients that we work with, we maybe we just tell them like, hey, we use this, it does this and this and this for us. Like this might be a central place, but I don't think we, well, I don't think we surface that right now cause too early for that, but just something I'm think.

@Trent [1:25:02]: Yeah, Yeah, you're right. I mean, instead of us building our own application We could build out a Operating system or something, right? Inside of notion.

@Matthew Kerns [1:25:15]: Yeah

@Trent [1:25:17]: For their business

@Matthew Kerns [1:25:17]: And then Yeah, and just connect all their stuff for them and show them how to use it and that might be Quick and You know, something we could even just prototype it and have them try it.

@Trent [1:25:31]: Yeah, we absolutely can do that. I mean, they just have to pay the monthly fee and they paid our for our services to put it in place for them, right? So, yeah, yeah, yeah, it's definitely an option. There's no doubt. I think that, you know, we have a ways to go to figure it out how to use it on our side and then once we have that figured out, I think that we can start to propose that to our clients.

@Matthew Kerns [1:25:38]: Mhm. Yeah, that makes sense

@Trent [1:25:51]: So, but what I was, I was actually last night I almost did this. I almost set up cloud code to talk to notion so they can manage my notion. Now,

@Matthew Kerns [1:26:01]: Oh no

@Trent [1:26:02]: Go ahead, what

@Matthew Kerns [1:26:04]: I was just saying nice. Yeah, that's good.

@Trent [1:26:06]: Well, I mean, you saw what I did with the infrastructure NAN.

@Matthew Kerns [1:26:11]: Mhm.

@Trent [1:26:12]: I, I had Claude Coat do all of that. I mean,

@Matthew Kerns [1:26:15]: Yeah

@Trent [1:26:16]: I pointed it to where my doc ploy instances, so Doc Ploy just manages containers like railway. And I gave it an API key

@Matthew Kerns [1:26:23]: Mhm

@Trent [1:26:26]: And I gave it cloud flare, so cloudFlare is where I manage the the the The domain. So,

@Matthew Kerns [1:26:35]: Mhm. OK. So API access to your domain provider?

@Trent [1:26:40]: Boom, I gave it

@Matthew Kerns [1:26:40]: Dang

@Trent [1:26:41]: Yep And then it, it configured, it configured my cloud flare tunnel With the new domain

@Matthew Kerns [1:26:48]: Oh

@Trent [1:26:49]: Subdomains, and it configured Docploy and deployed it. And tested to make sure they were running. I, I, I had Claude Coe do all that.

@Matthew Kerns [1:26:57]: What So that, that accelerates that whole process just so much.

@Trent [1:27:04]: Thank you. Bingo. That's precisely what I'm saying. That's, that's what I'm saying here. So what I had to do was So there's a directive that it created for Where, where is it at? Team infrastructure.

@Trent [1:27:21]: So team infrastructure This is what I don't like Like, if I'm trying to show somebody something, it comes up in markdown and it's not as easy to read, but then you get the preview and it's easier to read, but I don't like all the steps I had to go through to get to this.

@Matthew Kerns [1:27:36]: Yeah, yeah

@Trent [1:27:38]: So I just spoke to it, told it what I wanted to do, right? And it created this document with, you know, when to use. So I said, hey, I need you to document all this stuff, and it helped me plan how we're going to do sandboxes, how we're going to do the production instance of NAN

@Trent [1:27:55]: What the, the domain URLs all look alike. What host port they point to because they're all running on the same box. They all have to be bound to a different port, and because we're using Docker or we're using Docploy, it, you can just map ports easily. So it did all that though. Like I, I didn't do that.

@Matthew Kerns [1:28:15]: Yeah, well.

@Trent [1:28:17]: And it created, it created these here, these composed templates for Docker compose.

@Matthew Kerns [1:28:18]: Incredible. Yup.

@Trent [1:28:23]: It created this for me. I had to point it to a few things because it wasn't quite right. But at, at the end of the day, it helped me create this. The environmental variables. The we're doing SQ light Database for the sandbox instances.

@Trent [1:28:43]: And we're doing post-gress QL for our production instance. So

@Matthew Kerns [1:28:48]: OK

@Trent [1:28:49]: It For the sandboxes, you know, for you, for you and for me or whatnot, it doesn't really matter that much. We're fine with just using SQ1. It simplifies things.

@Matthew Kerns [1:29:00]: Mhm

@Trent [1:29:00]: See what else we got here Tunnel ingress rules, so there's the mapping there. So it maps it to a local host 3000 in different ports.

@Matthew Kerns [1:29:10]: Yup

@Trent [1:29:12]: I mean, but I just ordered what I wanted to do, and it created the directive, and it created the execution layer. Which I think it created Doc Ploy API So right there's the the script for the DocPloy API.

@Trent [1:29:28]: And CloudFlare API So, I was just last night gonna say, hey, look, I need you to create

@Matthew Kerns [1:29:31]: Yeah

@Trent [1:29:36]: A notion API tool. So that you can interact with notion.

@Matthew Kerns [1:29:41]: Mhm.

@Trent [1:29:42]: And I think I actually might have started that, to be honest. If I go look at my conversations, let me look at that real quick.

@Matthew Kerns [1:29:48]: Just whoops The Donnelly set up this whole integration. It's insane what we can do nowadays.

@Trent [1:29:56]: Oh, I'm just like amazed at it right now. I mean, like, I'm like, I feel like it's a serious unlock that I understand, I can go to Notion AI. And I can ask not or notion AI to build out a page for me. But that doesn't manage the infrastructure and then it doesn't manage the, like, slack plus notion, plus doc ploy, plus like you're bringing all these things together.

@Matthew Kerns [1:30:11]: Mhm

@Trent [1:30:23]: And I'm just like

@Matthew Kerns [1:30:23]: Right

@Trent [1:30:24]: To execute a bigger task

@Matthew Kerns [1:30:27]: Yeah, so like having your clawed code agentic workflows in this one place, then it can see everything and all the integrations and then manage it and manage how they all connect so you don't have to

@Trent [1:30:40]: Yeah.

@Matthew Kerns [1:30:41]: Go from inside notion AI and be like, hey, help me connect to this other thing, like, and it doesn't know any of the context.

@Trent [1:30:46]: Mhm It got right, the big plan, it doesn't know the master plan, right? So now I have to copy and paste like a prompt between multiple tools to try to execute it or something, and, and they're just not as good at planning and execution like Claude Coe is, so

@Matthew Kerns [1:30:49]: Yeah.

@Trent [1:31:04]: And not only that, but I can take these scripts and we can port them over. We can transport them and put them into a service in the cloud if we wanted to or into a Docker container wherever.

@Matthew Kerns [1:31:04]: Yeah. Yeah

@Trent [1:31:16]: So But here's the next thing that I'm thinking right now. Is this is gonna get Difficult to keep organized And I don't necessarily want to blend domain. Domain specific knowledge.

@Trent [1:31:34]: Not necessarily So, I've got stuff in here for scraping leads. For example, scraping leads has nothing to do with managing Docploy.

@Matthew Kerns [1:31:43]: Mhm

@Trent [1:31:44]: So what I need to do is I need to find a way to separate them so that I open up. I'm going to call them agentic workspaces. So when I go into my infrastructure management workspace. It has all the tools I need for my Management of the infrastructure

@Trent [1:32:01]: Right?

@Matthew Kerns [1:32:01]: Oh

@Trent [1:32:01]: I go over to my sales Agentic workspace, and it has things for scraping leads and creating proposals or whatever.

@Matthew Kerns [1:32:09]: Yeah, and then there'll be like a development one, which I guess is part of

@Trent [1:32:13]: Yup

@Matthew Kerns [1:32:17]: There's some interface there with the infrastructure. But yeah, it might just be completely separate. We'll have to figure out How we wanna organize it, but, or just ask Claude to that out for us.

@Trent [1:32:28]: OK. It's good Yeah, it's gonna evolve and yeah, and that's another thing I had too was like I was waiting for it to grow a little bit, like add a few tools here and there. And then I would ask Claude Code, Hey, can you just look at all the stuff I have in here and help plan out how to divide it, right?

@Matthew Kerns [1:32:44]: Mhm. Yeah, yeah, that's what I'm doing now with like the meeting transcripts and stuff, cause I keep asking it, like, hey, like how can we better organize this? And then I'll put this stuff in there and then like, there's different projects that have different levels of organization. So every once in a while I'll just ask it like, hey, can you make sure we have the latest organization across all of them. So, but asking Claude to do the organization is a key.

@Trent [1:33:10]: Mhm. Yeah, that, that's precisely what I'm looking at here is that Claude Code Gives me the ability to create tools on the fly So I can manage multiple services, multiple tools, execute multiple tasks all in one request.

@Trent [1:33:31]: Right?

@Matthew Kerns [1:33:32]: Yeah. Yeah

@Trent [1:33:34]: Yeah, so

@Matthew Kerns [1:33:35]: It's, that's huge, yeah, I love that you're working on that. And I wanna work with this going on mine as soon as it makes sense to also.

@Trent [1:33:39]: Yeah Yeah I got it managing, you know, what was all in the directives. So audio to SOP client onboarding, email classifications, generate diagrams, generate proposals, mark down to Google Doc.

@Trent [1:33:58]: NAN workflows cause I have it to where it created the API. I can deploy an NAN workflow.

@Matthew Kerns [1:34:05]: Mhm

@Trent [1:34:06]: Create it, test it, or sorry, create it, deploy it, test it, look at the execution log and correct it and then redeploy it. I mean, it can do all that.

@Matthew Kerns [1:34:17]: Well, I see, I need that.

@Trent [1:34:17]: Yeah. Yeah, scrape leads, slack management, team infrastructure, and then writing SOPs. Then, like, in the execution, these are all the tools that they use, so the directives are just instructions on what to do for the task, and then the the tools are what it's building along the way as it needs them.

@Trent [1:34:39]: So cloud flare, copy slides, debug Aify, deploy

@Matthew Kerns [1:34:40]: Yeah

@Trent [1:34:45]: Her docboy, extract SOP. I don't remember what that one's for exactly, but maybe it's For the audio

@Matthew Kerns [1:34:52]: I mean, yeah.

@Trent [1:34:53]: Yeah, generate proposal, mark down to Doc X, marked down to Google Doc. Which is something I was playing with to try to figure out how we can take the markdown document, and then put it into a user-friendly format.

@Matthew Kerns [1:35:10]: Yeah

@Trent [1:35:11]: So I was working on that. Migrate Aski to mermaid.

@Matthew Kerns [1:35:18]: Yeah

@Trent [1:35:18]: I told you to stop making AI diagrams and start making them in mermaid form.

@Matthew Kerns [1:35:24]: Mhm

@Trent [1:35:25]: So, do I have I don't know if I have any PDFs open right now.

@Matthew Kerns [1:35:33]: Yeah, the mermaid ones are cool, cause it's like a whole, basically we can use that for architectural diagramming, We might even be doing that pretty soon with the whole jober and quo and Gmail integration.

@Trent [1:35:54]: Oh, mermaid Yeah, so there's One of the mermaid diagrams that it created on its own, because I was trying to figure out how do we process this stuff and put it into a good user form. This is the source

@Trent [1:36:11]: This is the generated image. So that it can be put into a PDF or put into a Word document. I'm not doing it, it's doing it, but it needed to create an image so that it showed up correctly in the in the document.

@Matthew Kerns [1:36:28]: Yeah, yep, and then this is a sequence diagram, and there's different types of diagrams that mermaid does.

@Trent [1:36:34]: I Yep, tons of them. We can also do the same thing with DrawIO. So it's like whatever works best, we can use mermaid, we can use yo. The nice thing about DraIO is it generates it and it's easy to edit. Mermaid's not as easy to edit because you got to edit it in text.

@Trent [1:36:51]: Kind of clunky, clunky for

@Matthew Kerns [1:36:51]: Mhm

@Trent [1:36:53]: You know, it's not what you see is what you get.

@Matthew Kerns [1:36:56]: Yeah, it's like you wanna be able to edit it with click and and and type and drag and drop, but you also want to be able to edit it with cloud code.

@Trent [1:37:05]: Yep, precisely. So here's See if I can get this Finder

@Trent [1:37:29]: So I was working on this. This is like a doc X. Right here. So it, it While it has this white space in between there, it did get the Mermaid diagram as a PNG. Put it in there, put this in there.

@Trent [1:37:47]: But I, I tested a different outcome because I, I was concerned that this being a Word document. That if someone edits the word document, How do we go backwards So I was like, OK, that sucks. So how do we, I was like, you know what, screw it. We're not even going to let them edit it. Let's make it a PDF because actually PDF is actually easier and actually formatted nicer, so let me find that real quick.

@Matthew Kerns [1:38:17]: OK

@Trent [1:38:20]: I, we're kind of getting into the weeds here, but it's still kind of cool to look at, Trying to see where

@Matthew Kerns [1:38:26]: Yeah, for sure Like, I feel like this is getting me more up to speed on all the capabilities you've been working on, so.

@Trent [1:38:35]: Yeah, yeah, yeah. So let me see if I can get Effusion directives, diagrams, Kelsey, Potter mechanics. There's Process maps, slack plan, how do I find?

@Trent [1:38:54]: Bozo MCP templates, it's not templates. This is another problem I have too is that finding what I'm looking for

@Matthew Kerns [1:39:03]: I just asked Claude to look before me.

@Trent [1:39:07]: Yeah, I can do that. Let's see if I can figure out. I'm looking for a mermaid testing situation where I

@Trent [1:39:24]: Actually hold on, and I just remembered. I remembered where I had it. I don't even have it in here because I was doing it while I was out and about. So it's actually not in cloud code, so hold on a second.

@Matthew Kerns [1:39:35]: OK.

@Trent [1:39:37]: It's actually in clouded Markdown tools for client documentation. And then Go away What are you doing here

@Trent [1:39:53]: Here it is Yeah, OK, so No, so that was ugly. I didn't like that. Close that.

@Trent [1:40:09]: Mark down PDF. Styled SOP. Here we go. Yeah, so this is what I liked, this one right here.

@Matthew Kerns [1:40:19]: OK

@Trent [1:40:21]: So, even though it doesn't have the process flow diagram in it.

@Matthew Kerns [1:40:21]: Yeah.

@Trent [1:40:25]: Look at how neatly this, it took a markdown document And it, it created this really nice Professional looking

@Matthew Kerns [1:40:35]: Hmm

@Trent [1:40:35]: PDF

@Matthew Kerns [1:40:37]: Yeah

@Trent [1:40:39]: So I was, I was

@Matthew Kerns [1:40:39]: That's really good This can be, this can be like the style that we use for

@Trent [1:40:43]: Yeah.

@Matthew Kerns [1:40:48]: Internal processes for deliverables, like I think it's Yeah, it looks solid

@Trent [1:40:54]: Yeah, I thought it was pretty solid too, and what it actually does is it takes Mark down, converts it to HTML. HTML to PDF. Apparently from HTML to PDF is a really clean conversion, so.

@Matthew Kerns [1:41:05]: Yeah. Yeah, yeah, I did that for one of my proposals for my first paying client that I posted the one about was just created an HTML and it knew how to do that, and it looked kind of similar.

@Trent [1:41:17]: Yeah Yup. And then This right here After I got it to where I liked it, I said, hey, is there any way that you can make this transportable so I can bring it into Cloud code. And it, it created an SOP skill for me.

@Trent [1:41:35]: Which I haven't moved it yet. I haven't tried it yet, but I was working towards it. I was like, OK.

@Matthew Kerns [1:41:44]: Yeah. So powerful

@Trent [1:41:48]: Yeah, I didn't like this. It looked kind of ugly. It was OK. It just looks archaic, and I was like, it's not as easy to read.

@Matthew Kerns [1:41:52]: Mhm Yeah, none of colors.

@Trent [1:41:59]: But here, here's what it did. It started from this. This is the sample SOP In markdown So I did this The only thing it didn't do is it didn't convert mermaid. It can't do that. This is another thing we have to think about.

@Trent [1:42:18]: I was thinking about how we can build out this demo. In N8N In the cloud Hosted version of N8N. You can't do this. You can't do the mermaid to PNG conversion.

@Trent [1:42:34]: Because the, the packages that you need Have to run on the base operating system. Like they have to run in the Os behind the, behind NAN.

@Matthew Kerns [1:42:47]: Hm

@Trent [1:42:47]: So To do that, we actually have to host our own instance of NAN, or we have to move the service that does the conversion to our own service, and we call it, and it sends it back.

@Matthew Kerns [1:43:02]: Interesting. So there's no way to just Move the right dependency into the container that OK.

@Trent [1:43:10]: The You For the the cloud hosted version of N8N because we're not managing the infrastructure, right? We don't have the ability to modify the Docker container that

@Matthew Kerns [1:43:18]: OK.

@Trent [1:43:22]: NAN runs inside of But we do, we do for our demos

@Matthew Kerns [1:43:24]: Yeah, yeah. Yeah

@Trent [1:43:28]: And and we do if we deploy it on railway Or however we want to do it, we can do that.

@Matthew Kerns [1:43:34]: Mhm

@Trent [1:43:34]: But if we put This solution into the cloud hosted version of N8N. We can't We can't do this all in one. We'd have to host the service somewhere else.

@Trent [1:43:51]: So anyway

@Matthew Kerns [1:43:52]: So that's gonna be something that, like when we do our final deliverables to clients, we have to keep in mind.

@Trent [1:44:01]: Capabilities, right

@Matthew Kerns [1:44:03]: Yeah

@Trent [1:44:05]: So, it did not do it, like when I showed you the Styled SOP The reason that it left this as a Dotted rectangle Is because it does not have the dependencies to run that.

@Trent [1:44:23]: Code to do the conversion.

@Matthew Kerns [1:44:26]: Gotcha OK

@Trent [1:44:28]: Yeah. So But anyway

@Matthew Kerns [1:44:33]: Yeah, good to know

@Trent [1:44:34]: Yeah. So anyway, that's Anyway, I can let you do whatever you're doing there. Unless you got something else you wanna chat about right now? I don't want to distract you working on what you're doing.

@Matthew Kerns [1:44:48]: I mean Yeah Yeah. No, I think, yeah, might be a good time to hop off, but I was just thinking like, Well, I guess we can, yeah, we can chat about cause basically we'll I'll

@Matthew Kerns [1:45:06]: Work with Mikel and come up with sort of like the deliverables, and then what I wanna do is start building, so I think at that point, maybe we sync up again and we start like, like I wanna make sure I understand or I get in my environment, like how to

@Matthew Kerns [1:45:24]: The up to speed on what you're doing with NAN so that I can start building the NAM workflow on my side, like the workflows that we're gonna create.

@Trent [1:45:32]: Yeah, I mean, if you want me to give you access or I'll copy over the files or something to give you access to my NAM stuff that I have in clouded code. If you want to start working on it that way, you can. I think that might be a good way to start getting you up to speed for it.

@Matthew Kerns [1:45:49]: Yeah, sure Is it in GitHub or is it just local still?

@Trent [1:45:53]: Not currently, so my thought here was like I didn't really know what the hell I was doing, so I didn't want to create a bunch of cluttered mess And then put it in GitHub and then have to worry about that at the time. So I've just been doing it local, but I think I'm about at the point where I need to do what I talked about.

@Trent [1:46:11]: Separate into Different agentic workspaces. And then, then, Push him to GitHub

@Matthew Kerns [1:46:19]: OK.

@Trent [1:46:20]: And that'll be where I start my, my repository for agentic workspaces.

@Matthew Kerns [1:46:26]: Sounds good

@Trent [1:46:27]: OK, so maybe I'll work on that. The The things primarily I'm working on until we narrow down the deliverables or I'll look into the email. Domains And I will work on separating my agent workspaces that makes it easily shareable.

@Trent [1:46:43]: OK.

@Matthew Kerns [1:46:45]: Sounds good. And then if you could maybe zip, just zip it up and send it over to me. then, if you think that's a good idea, but then I don't really need it until we nail in the deliverables, but I think Mika is going to be on a call with me in like 20 minutes, probably, so.

@Trent [1:47:03]: That's fine. Just let me know

@Matthew Kerns [1:47:06]: I'll just ping you

@Trent [1:47:07]: Yeah, you can ping me. That's fine. I'll, I'll be around. I got things to do, I guess, but I'll be around. OK?

@Matthew Kerns [1:47:13]: OK. Sounds great.

@Trent [1:47:14]: Perfect. Thanks. See ya.

@Matthew Kerns [1:47:16]: All right. Yeah, yep. See ya.
