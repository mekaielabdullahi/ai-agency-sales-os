### 3.3 Pricing Strategy & Margin Structure (~20 min)

#### Core Pricing Questions

**1. How to Price the First Project**
- Discovery call pricing: $200-500/hr (billable diagnostic)
- Prototype phase: Fixed price or hourly?
- Developer costs + margin calculation
- AAA coaching time: Included or separate line item?

**2. Margin Structure**
```
CLIENT PRICE
- Developer cost (actual)
- Agency margin (covers: management, QA, risk, coordination)
- Sales commission (Mekaiel/Chris share)
= Net profit to split among equity partners
```

**3. Example Pricing Scenario**
```
Client pays: $5,000
Developer cost: $2,000
Gross margin: $3,000

Split options to discuss:
- Sales commission (10-20%): $300-600
- Remaining to split among equity partners: $2,400-2,700

How do we split the $2,400-2,700?
- Equal 4-way split: $600-675 each
- Weighted by contribution
- Based on time invested
```

**4. Phased Delivery Pricing**

Option 1: 50/50 split
- 50% upfront (covers discovery, prototype, Phase 1)
- 50% on completion (Phase 2+)

Option 2: 40/30/20 split
- Phase 1: 40-50% upfront (covers prototype + initial build)
- Phase 2: 30-40% mid-project (after Phase 1 demo)
- Phase 3: 20% final payment (completion & handoff)

**5. Cost Breakdown Components**
```
Discovery call time: ____ hours @ $____/hr = $_____
Prototype time: ____ hours @ $____/hr = $_____
AAA coach meetings: $____ (included or separate?)
Developer selection: ____ hours @ $____/hr = $_____
Developer cost: $_____
QA/Testing time: ____ hours @ $____/hr = $_____
Client demos/delivery: ____ hours @ $____/hr = $_____

TOTAL COST: $_____
CLIENT PRICE (with margin): $_____
MARGIN: $_____ or _____%
```

**6. Developer Cost Management**
- How to find developer rates (research phase)
- Typical dev rates: $30-150/hr depending on skill/location
- Fixed price vs hourly for developers
- Managing scope creep with fixed-price dev contracts

#### Pricing Strategy Options

**Option A: Fixed Price Per Phase**
- Client gets fixed price quote upfront
- We manage developer costs internally
- Higher margin potential, higher risk

**Option B: Cost-Plus Pricing**
- Transparent: "Dev costs $X, our management fee is $Y"
- Lower margin, lower risk
- Builds trust through transparency

**Option C: Hybrid**
- Discovery/Prototype: Fixed price
- Implementation: Cost-plus with margin
- Balance between risk and trust

**Questions to Decide:**
- What's our target margin %? (Industry standard: 30-50%)
- Do we show dev costs to client or keep internal?
- How do we handle dev cost overruns?
- What's included in "agency management fee"?
- How do we split profits among equity partners on first project?

#### Example First Project Pricing

```
DISCOVERY & PROTOTYPE PHASE
- Discovery call (2 hrs): $400
- AAA coach strategy session: $200
- Prototype build (10 hrs): $1,000
- Client refinement (5 hrs): $500
Subtotal: $2,100

IMPLEMENTATION PHASE
- Developer selection (5 hrs): $500
- Developer cost (estimated): $2,500
- QA & testing (8 hrs): $800
- Client demo & delivery (3 hrs): $300
Subtotal: $4,100

TOTAL PROJECT: $6,200
Payment structure: $3,100 upfront | $3,100 on completion
```

**Profit Split Discussion:**
```
Gross margin after dev costs: $3,700

Potential split:
- Sales commission (15%): $555
- Net to equity partners: $3,145
- 4-way split: $786 each

OR

Weighted by contribution:
- Discovery/Sales partner: 30% = $943
- Technical partners: 25% each = $786
- Strategy/Management: 20% = $629
```
