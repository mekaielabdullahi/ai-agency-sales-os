## Strategic Decisions from Meetings

### 2025-12-10 Partner Huddle

**Key Strategic Shifts:**

1. **Free Audit Approach** - Decided to provide comprehensive AI audits at no cost initially to build trust and demonstrate value before asking for payment.

2. **3-Tier Engagement Model** - Adopted systematic progression: Free Audit → Low-Cost Entry ($3-5K) → Scale ($10K+/month)

3. **Trent's 3-Step Framework** - Standardized on: Stakeholder Interviews → End-User Interviews → Readiness Survey

4. **Multi-Perspective Analysis** - Each partner creates independent process maps and opportunity matrices, then consolidates insights

5. **Case Study Focus** - Plotter Mechanix is flagship proof of concept, not just a client engagement

**Impact on OBG ($50K/month × 3 months):**
- Repeatable framework enables scaling from 0 → 5+ clients
- Free audit reduces friction for client acquisition
- Case study accelerates future sales cycles
- Systematic approach makes 10 clients × $10K/month mathematically achievable

## Notes

**Strategic Context:**
December 2025 is the month the agency crystallized its systematic approach. Previously ad-hoc client work, now structured and repeatable framework for scaling.

**Critical Path:**
Plotter Mechanix case study (P0) → Validates entire agency model → Creates templates and documentation (P1) → Enables scaling to 10+ clients → $100K/month revenue

**Resource Allocation:**
- Matthew: Plotter delivery + case study (P0)
- Trent: Framework documentation (P1)
- Chris: Client relationships and conversion (P0-P1)
- Team: Pricing model collaboration (P1)
