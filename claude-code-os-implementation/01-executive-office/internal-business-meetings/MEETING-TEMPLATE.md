# Meeting Folder Template

## Quick Setup

To create a new meeting folder:

```bash
# Set meeting details
MEETING_DATE="YYYY-MM-DD"
MEETING_NAME="meeting-name"

# Create folder structure
mkdir -p "claude-code-os-implementation/01-executive-office/internal-business-meetings/meetings/${MEETING_DATE}-${MEETING_NAME}/01-raw"
mkdir -p "claude-code-os-implementation/01-executive-office/internal-business-meetings/meetings/${MEETING_DATE}-${MEETING_NAME}/02-processed"
mkdir -p "claude-code-os-implementation/01-executive-office/internal-business-meetings/meetings/${MEETING_DATE}-${MEETING_NAME}/03-integrated"

# Create placeholder files from templates
cp claude-code-os-implementation/01-executive-office/internal-business-meetings/templates/* \
   claude-code-os-implementation/01-executive-office/internal-business-meetings/meetings/${MEETING_DATE}-${MEETING_NAME}/02-processed/
```

## Processing Workflow

### Phase 1: Raw Capture
1. Drop audio file in `01-raw/audio.*`
2. Take notes in `01-raw/raw-notes.md` during meeting
3. Add Fathom export to `01-raw/fathom-export.md` (if available)

### Phase 2: Transcription
1. Whisper auto-transcribes audio → `01-raw/transcript.md`
2. Or manually trigger: `bash audio-processing-tools/whisper-local/batch-processor.sh /path/to/audio.m4a`

### Phase 3: Processing
1. Read transcript + raw notes
2. Use Claude to extract structured data
3. Fill in files in `02-processed/`

### Phase 4: Integration
1. Add urgent items to daily plan
2. Add important items to weekly plan
3. Add strategic items to active-items.md
4. Update roadmap files
5. Document in `03-integrated/system-updates.md`
