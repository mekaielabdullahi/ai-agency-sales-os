# Strategic Alignment Checklist

## Quick Alignment Check (30 seconds)

Before starting any significant work, run through:

```
[ ] Does this serve the OBG? (Deliver client results → Case studies → Get paid)
[ ] Is this a P0 or P1 priority?
[ ] Will this move the needle this week?
[ ] Am I the right person to do this? (vs. delegate/automate/eliminate)
```

**If 3+ boxes unchecked → STOP. Reconsider this task.**

## Daily Alignment (Morning Planning)

### THE ONE THING Check
- [ ] I know my ONE THING for today
- [ ] It directly serves a current client OR advances P1 priorities
- [ ] I will work on it FIRST before anything else
- [ ] I can complete it today (or make meaningful progress)

### Tier 1 Tasks Check
- [ ] All Tier 1 tasks support OBG
- [ ] No Tier 2/3 tasks disguised as Tier 1
- [ ] Realistic for today's available time
- [ ] Dependencies identified and cleared

---

## Weekly Alignment (Sunday/Monday)

### OBG Progress Check
- [ ] Made measurable progress toward OBG this week
- [ ] Client work advanced (Linh, Trevor)
- [ ] No strategic drift into lower priority work
- [ ] Identified and removed blockers

### Priority Balance Check
- [ ] Majority of time spent on P0 (client delivery)
- [ ] P1 foundations progressing (contracts, pricing)
- [ ] Coaching/learning scheduled (P2)
- [ ] Case study data being captured (P3)

### Alignment Score
Rate 1-10: How aligned was this week's work with strategic priorities?

| Score | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| 9-10 | Excellent - Almost all work served OBG |
| 7-8 | Good - Minor drift, corrected quickly |
| 5-6 | Warning - Significant time on non-priorities |
| <5 | Critical - Strategic drift, needs intervention |

---

## Monthly Alignment (End of Month)

### OBG Trajectory
- [ ] On track to achieve OBG within 90 days?
- [ ] Key milestones hit this month?
- [ ] Any blockers that need strategic intervention?

### Client Status Review
For each client:
- [ ] Automation delivering results?
- [ ] Metrics captured (baseline vs. current)?
- [ ] Client satisfied and engaged?
- [ ] Testimonial secured or path clear?

### Priority Recalibration
- [ ] P0-P3 priorities still correct?
- [ ] Any priority that should move up/down?
- [ ] New priorities that emerged?
- [ ] Anti-priorities that crept back in?

---

## Red Flags (Immediate Correction Needed)

Trigger alignment review if:
- [ ] Spent 2+ days without client-facing progress
- [ ] Working on "nice to have" while client work pending
- [ ] Avoiding coaching calls or build reviews
- [ ] Building systems instead of delivering results
- [ ] Pursuing new clients before case studies ready

---

## Alignment Recovery Protocol

If alignment score drops below 7:

1. **STOP** current non-essential work
2. **LIST** all active tasks
3. **FILTER** through OBG lens - what actually matters?
4. **ELIMINATE** or defer everything else
5. **FOCUS** next 48 hours on highest-impact P0 task
6. **REASSESS** after 48 hours

## Quick Reference: The Core Questions

| When | Ask |
|------|-----|
| Starting a task | "Does this serve the OBG?" |
| Feeling busy but unproductive | "Am I working on P0?" |
| End of day | "Did THE ONE THING get done?" |
| End of week | "Did clients progress?" |
| Making any decision | "What would serve client results?" |
