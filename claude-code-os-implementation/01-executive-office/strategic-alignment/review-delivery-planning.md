# Review & Delivery Planning - Dec 25, 2025

**Created:** December 25, 2025 9:15 AM
**Context:** Bottleneck shifted from building to review/testing/delivery
**Priority:** P0 - Delivery drives revenue

---

## The Strategic Shift

### Before AutoClaude:
- **Bottleneck:** Building/coding capacity
- **Constraint:** One thing at a time, manual development
- **Focus:** Getting things built

### After AutoClaude:
- **Bottleneck:** Review/testing/delivery capacity ✅
- **Constraint:** Me reviewing, testing manually/visually, evaluating
- **Focus:** Getting things DELIVERED and SHIPPED

**This is a GOOD problem.** AutoClaude is working. Now we need delivery discipline.

---

## Current State Assessment

### What's Working:
- ✅ AutoClaude moving multiple projects forward simultaneously
- ✅ Roadmaps built out for projects
- ✅ Claude Code subscription optimized (multiple projects per dollar spent)
- ✅ Faster build cycles than ever before

### What's Blocking:
- 🚨 Multiple projects sitting in REVIEW stage
- 🚨 Need to manually test and evaluate code quality
- 🚨 Need to assess AutoClaude's actual performance
- 🚨 Need to prioritize what ships first
- 🚨 Delivery workflow not yet systematized

---

## Projects in Review Stage

### High Priority - Need to Ship:

#### 1. Trevor Bradford - IDEA Brand Coach Website
**Client:** Trevor Bradford (PAYING CLIENT)
**Status:** In development, needs to reach beta-testing state
**Priority:** P0 (revenue client)
**Next Steps:**
- [ ] Review current build state
- [ ] Test functionality manually
- [ ] Identify gaps to professional beta state
- [ ] Define delivery roadmap
- [ ] Set deadline for beta handoff

**Why P0:** Paying client, need to deliver to maintain trust and get paid

---

#### 2. Invoice & Receipts Processing Automation
**Client:** Linh (internal/demo for sales)
**Status:** Built, needs cleanup and evaluation
**Priority:** P1 (demo asset for sales)
**Next Steps:**
- [ ] Review current implementation
- [ ] Test with real invoices/receipts
- [ ] Evaluate accuracy and reliability
- [ ] Clean up edge cases
- [ ] Prepare for demo/handoff

**Why P1:** Demo asset to close future deals, internal tool for efficiency

---

### Other Projects (To Be Assessed):

#### 3. [Project Name]
**Status:** [Review stage / needs testing / etc.]
**Priority:** [P0/P1/P2]
**Next Steps:**
- [ ] [Define next steps]

## The New Workflow: Review → Test → Deliver

### Phase 1: Inventory (Do This First)
**Goal:** Know what's in review stage and prioritize

**Actions:**
1. [ ] List ALL projects AutoClaude has worked on
2. [ ] Assess current state of each (built, partial, needs review)
3. [ ] Identify what's blocking each from delivery
4. [ ] Prioritize based on:
   - Revenue impact (paying clients first)
   - Demo value (sales assets second)
   - Strategic value (internal tools third)

**Output:** Prioritized list of projects to review/test/deliver

---

### Phase 2: Review & Test (Systematic Approach)
**Goal:** Evaluate what's been built and assess quality

**For Each Project:**
1. [ ] **Manual testing**
   - Does it work as expected?
   - What breaks or fails?
   - Edge cases handled?
   - User experience acceptable?

2. [ ] **Code review** (if needed)
   - Quality of AutoClaude's output
   - Security considerations
   - Performance issues?
   - Documentation adequate?

3. [ ] **AutoClaude evaluation**
   - Did it follow the roadmap?
   - Quality vs. manual coding?
   - What would I do differently?
   - Trust level for future tasks?

**Output:** Pass/fail + gap list for each project

---

### Phase 3: Gap Closure (Get to Shippable)
**Goal:** Fix what's broken, fill what's missing

**Actions:**
1. [ ] For each project, create gap list:
   - Critical (must fix to ship)
   - Important (should fix before handoff)
   - Nice-to-have (defer)

2. [ ] Prioritize gap closure:
   - Fix critical gaps first
   - Use AutoClaude for repetitive fixes
   - Manual intervention where needed

3. [ ] Re-test after fixes
   - Verify gaps closed
   - No new issues introduced
   - Meets delivery standard

**Output:** Shippable projects ready for handoff

---

### Phase 4: Delivery (Ship It)
**Goal:** Get it into client/user hands

**Actions:**
1. [ ] **Prepare for handoff:**
   - Documentation complete?
   - Demo/walkthrough ready?
   - Support plan defined?

2. [ ] **Deliver to client:**
   - Schedule handoff meeting
   - Walk through functionality
   - Gather feedback
   - Address immediate issues

3. [ ] **Collect payment/value:**
   - Invoice if client project
   - Use for demo if sales asset
   - Implement if internal tool

**Output:** Delivered project, payment collected or value realized

---

## Prioritization Framework

**Use this to decide what to review/test/deliver first:**

### P0 - Revenue Critical:
- Paying clients (Trevor Bradford)
- Projects blocking payment
- Overdue deliverables

**Rule:** Do these FIRST, always.

---

### P1 - Revenue Enabling:
- Demo assets for sales (Invoice automation)
- Prototypes to close deals
- Tools that unlock new offerings

**Rule:** Do these SECOND, they create future revenue.

---

### P2 - Strategic/Internal:
- Internal automation
- Process improvements
- Learning projects

**Rule:** Do these THIRD, only after P0/P1 complete.

---

## Time Blocking for Review/Delivery

### Suggested Approach:

**Daily Review Sessions:**
- 2-3 hour focused block
- ONE project per session
- Review → Test → Document gaps → Plan fixes

**Weekly Delivery Cadence:**
- Monday: Prioritize week's deliveries
- Tue-Thu: Review/test/fix sessions
- Friday: Ship what's ready, plan next week

**Monthly Reflection:**
- What got delivered?
- What's still in review?
- AutoClaude performance assessment
- Adjust workflow as needed

---

## AutoClaude Performance Evaluation

**As you review projects, track:**

### Quality Metrics:
- [ ] Code works as expected (Y/N/Partial)
- [ ] Followed roadmap accurately (Y/N/Partial)
- [ ] Edge cases handled (Y/N/Partial)
- [ ] Documentation adequate (Y/N/Partial)

### Efficiency Metrics:
- [ ] Time saved vs. manual coding
- [ ] Iterations needed to get to shippable
- [ ] Types of tasks it handles well
- [ ] Types of tasks it struggles with

### Trust Metrics:
- [ ] Comfortable shipping AutoClaude code? (Y/N)
- [ ] Would use again for similar tasks? (Y/N)
- [ ] Confidence level in output (1-10)

**Goal:** Understand where AutoClaude excels and where it needs oversight

---

## The Delivery-Focused Mindset

### OLD Mindset (Before AutoClaude):
- "I need to build more things"
- "Let me start another project"
- "More features = more value"

### NEW Mindset (After AutoClaude):
- "What's ready to ship?"
- "What's blocking delivery?"
- "Shipped > perfect"
- "Delivery = revenue"

**The Rule:** Focus compute time (AutoClaude) on high-value delivery work, not endless building.

---

## Next Actions (Do These Next)

### Immediate (Dec 26):
1. [ ] **Inventory all projects in review stage**
   - List every project AutoClaude has touched
   - Assess current state
   - Note what's blocking delivery

2. [ ] **Prioritize using framework above**
   - P0: Revenue critical (Trevor)
   - P1: Revenue enabling (Invoice automation)
   - P2: Strategic/internal

3. [ ] **Create delivery roadmap for top 3:**
   - Define "shippable" for each
   - List gaps to close
   - Estimate review/test/fix time
   - Set delivery deadlines

### This Week (Dec 26-31):
1. [ ] **Review & test Trevor's IDEA website**
   - Manual testing session
   - Gap list creation
   - Plan to professional beta state

2. [ ] **Review & test Invoice automation**
   - Test with real data
   - Evaluate accuracy
   - Clean up for demo

3. [ ] **Ship at least 1 project by Dec 31**
   - Deliver to client or launch internally
   - Collect feedback
   - Document lessons learned

## Strategic Implications

### For the Agency:
- **Speed is confirmed advantage** (AutoClaude works)
- **Delivery discipline is new differentiator** (ship fast AND quality)
- **Review capacity is the constraint** (need systematic workflow)

### For Pricing:
- Can justify premium pricing (build faster than competitors)
- Need to charge for review/testing time (not just building)
- Capacity constraint = prioritize high-paying clients

### For Client Positioning:
- "We build AND ship fast" (not just build)
- "Professional beta in X weeks" (concrete timeline)
- "Iterative delivery" (ship, gather feedback, improve)

---

## Success Metrics

**This planning is working if:**
- [ ] Projects move from review → shipped weekly
- [ ] Paying clients get deliveries on time
- [ ] Demo assets available for sales conversations
- [ ] AutoClaude performance understood and optimized
- [ ] Revenue increases (delivered projects = payment)

---

## Integration with OBG

**OBG:** $50k/month × 3 months

**How delivery focus supports OBG:**
1. **Ship Trevor's website** → Maintain client trust → Get paid → Future revenue
2. **Ship invoice automation** → Demo for sales → Close more deals → Revenue
3. **Systematic delivery** → More clients served → More revenue → OBG

**The Equation:**
- More delivered projects = More satisfied clients = More referrals = More revenue
