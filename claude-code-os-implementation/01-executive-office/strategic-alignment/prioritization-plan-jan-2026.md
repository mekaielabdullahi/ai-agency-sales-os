# Prioritization Plan: January 11-14, 2026

**Created:** January 11, 2026
**Method:** Inversion Principle (What must we NOT do to avoid failure?)
**Stakes:** $45,000-55,000 revenue + client trust + team capacity

---

## Inversion: What Would Guarantee Failure?

1. Let Xigent proposal deadline pass without sending
2. Keep makers in meetings instead of building
3. Prioritize audit systems over client deliverables
4. Treat all tasks as equally urgent
5. Have no clear owner for each deliverable
6. Allow scope creep on in-progress work
7. Skip daily check-ins (lose alignment)
8. Hold too many check-ins (kill maker productivity)

**Therefore, we must do the OPPOSITE.**

- Skip Xigent deadline for other work

---

## The Accountability Board

| Person | Commitment | Daily Check |
|--------|------------|-------------|
| **Mekaiel** | Xigent proposal sent by Jan 14 | "Proposal at X%" |
| **Matthew** | 24+ dev hours on S&S Wolf | "X hours today" |
| **Trent** | 24+ dev hours on Plotter | "X hours today" |
| **Chris** | Zero maker interruptions | "No interrupts today" |

Report these numbers at EOD sync. No excuses, no stories - just the numbers.

---

## If Things Go Wrong

### Xigent proposal blocked
- **Cause:** Missing info, unclear scope
- **Action:** Mekaiel escalates to team sync, resolves in 30 min max
- **Owner:** Mekaiel pulls in whoever needed, doesn't wait

### Maker gets stuck on technical issue
- **Cause:** Integration problem, unexpected complexity
- **Action:** Post in Slack during next sync window, other maker helps
- **Owner:** Stuck maker flags immediately, doesn't spin

### Client creates urgency
- **Cause:** Client wants status, has questions
- **Action:** Mekaiel handles, does NOT interrupt makers
- **Owner:** Mekaiel says "I'll get back to you by [time]"

### Emergency (production fire)
- **Cause:** Actual system down
- **Action:** Phone call to relevant maker, immediate response
- **Owner:** Whoever owns the affected system

## The Weekly Rhythm (Going Forward)

After this sprint, establish this pattern:

```
WEEKLY STRUCTURE
================

Monday:     Sprint kickoff, weekly planning (1 hr meeting)
Tue-Thu:    Deep work (makers), coordination (managers)
Friday:     Sprint review, delivery prep (30 min meeting)
Sat-Sun:    Overflow if needed, otherwise rest

Daily:      15 min AM sync, 15 min EOD sync
Weekly:     1.5 hours total meetings for makers
```

---

## The Commitment

**This 72-hour sprint is about proving we can deliver.**

Xigent at $30-40K is a single deal that could represent 60-80% of our OBG for February.

Plotter and S&S Wolf are proof that we deliver what we promise.

Everything else can wait until January 15.

**Sign-off:**

- [ ] Matthew commits to 24+ hours S&S Wolf development
- [ ] Trent commits to 24+ hours Plotter Mechanix development
- [ ] Mekaiel commits to Xigent proposal sent by Jan 14
- [ ] Chris commits to supporting without interrupting makers

---

## The Mantra

*"Ship the work. Send the proposal. Protect the makers. Everything else is noise."*

---

*Next: Update team roles document with these priorities and share with all team members.*
