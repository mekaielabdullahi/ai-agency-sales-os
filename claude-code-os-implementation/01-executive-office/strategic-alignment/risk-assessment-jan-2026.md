# Risk Assessment: January 2026 Delivery Crisis Prevention

**Created:** January 11, 2026
**Context:** 3 days until Xigent proposal deadline. Multiple Phase 1 deliveries due. Team spread across audit process instead of delivery.

---

## The Stakes

| Opportunity | Value | Deadline | Risk Level |
|-------------|-------|----------|------------|
| **Xigent** | $30,000-40,000 | Jan 14 (3 days) | CRITICAL |
| **Plotter Mechanix Phase 1** | $10,000 unlock | Overdue | HIGH |
| **S&S Wolf Sheds Phase 1** | $5,000 | This week | HIGH |

**Total at risk if we fail:** $45,000-55,000 (nearly hits OBG for one month)

---

## Inversion Analysis: "How Could We Fail?"

### Failure Mode 1: Xigent Proposal Never Gets Sent

**How it happens:**
- Team is distracted by audit process work
- No one owns the proposal deadline
- January 14 arrives without a sent proposal
- Xigent moves on to another vendor

**Probability without intervention:** 60%

**Warning signs:**
- Proposal still has "TBD" fields on Jan 12
- No clear owner assigned
- Competing priorities eating the time

---

### Failure Mode 2: Plotter Mechanix Phase 1 Drags Into February

**How it happens:**
- Matthew and Trent pulled into meetings and audit work
- Development hours get fragmented
- Client loses confidence in delivery capability
- Phase 2 never unlocks
- Reputation damage spreads (Kelce talks to Chris's network)

**Probability without intervention:** 45%

**Warning signs:**
- Phase 1 deliverables still incomplete by Jan 12
- Devs report <4 hours of uninterrupted dev time per day
- Meeting count exceeds 3 per week for devs

---

### Failure Mode 3: S&S Wolf Sheds Client Trust Erodes

**How it happens:**
- Phase 1 keeps slipping
- Sandy loses patience
- $5K payment never collected
- Multi-location expansion ($10K+ future value) never materializes
- Case study opportunity lost

**Probability without intervention:** 40%

**Warning signs:**
- No tangible deliverable by Jan 15
- Client asking "when will this be done?" repeatedly
- Scope keeps expanding without delivery

---

### Failure Mode 4: Makers Become Meeting Zombies

**How it happens:**
- Matthew and Trent attend every audit meeting "to stay aligned"
- Their 10 four-hour blocks per week become 3-4 blocks
- Development velocity drops 60%+
- Everything takes 3x longer
- Team burns out trying to compensate

**Probability without intervention:** 70%

**Warning signs:**
- Devs in >2 meetings per day
- Devs switching context >5 times per day
- Devs reporting feeling "behind" constantly

---

### Failure Mode 5: Audit Process Becomes the Product

**How it happens:**
- Team perfects audit methodology
- Everyone works on systems and documentation
- Actual client deliverables stall
- Revenue stops flowing
- Team runs out of runway before OBG

**Probability without intervention:** 35%

**Warning signs:**
- More hours on internal systems than client deliverables
- Beautiful audit templates, zero delivered features
- "We're almost ready to start building" repeated for weeks

---

### Failure Mode 6: Role Confusion Creates Bottlenecks

**How it happens:**
- Everyone does a little of everything
- No one fully owns any deliverable
- Handoffs create delays
- Accountability is diffuse
- Things fall through cracks

**Probability without intervention:** 50%

**Warning signs:**
- Same question asked in multiple channels
- Tasks reassigned multiple times
- "I thought X was doing that" conversations

---

## The Core Problem

**All four team members focused on audit process = nobody focused on delivery.**

Current state:
- Chris (Manager) - Audit process + lead flow
- Mekaiel (Manager) - Audit process + customer experience + content systems
- Matthew (Maker) - Audit process + development
- Trent (Maker) - Audit process + development

Required state:
- Chris (Manager) - Lead flow, Xigent proposal support
- Mekaiel (Manager) - Client communication, PRD refinement, Xigent proposal ownership
- Matthew (Maker) - 80%+ development time, S&S Wolf delivery
- Trent (Maker) - 80%+ development time, Plotter Mechanix delivery

---

## Compound Risk Calculation

If even ONE major failure occurs:
- Lose $30-40K Xigent engagement
- OR lose client trust on existing projects
- OR burn out development capacity

Estimated probability of at least one failure without intervention: **85%**

Revenue impact: $15,000-55,000 in next 30 days

---

## The Brutal Truth

You have 72 hours to:
1. Finalize and send Xigent proposal ($30-40K at stake)
2. Show tangible progress to existing clients (trust at stake)
3. Shift makers back to making (capacity at stake)

The audit process is valuable, but it's currently eating the delivery capacity needed to close and deliver the deals the audit process is designed to win.

**Audit without delivery = impressive PowerPoints, zero revenue.**

---

## Root Cause

The team conflated "staying aligned" with "being in meetings."

Alignment can happen in 15 minutes at the start and end of each day.
Delivery requires 4-hour uninterrupted blocks.

The current balance is inverted.
