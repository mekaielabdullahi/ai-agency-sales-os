### Potential Revenue (Medium-Low Probability)

|---------|----------------|-------------|-------|
| **Concrete CEO** | $0-$2,500 | MEDIUM | Pilot audit if fast-tracked |
| **Plotter Mechanix** | $0-$5,000 | MEDIUM | If Phase 1 closes and delivers |
| **Remus Development** | $0 | LOW | Nurture phase only |
| **S&S Wolf Sheds** | $??? | UNKNOWN | Not located |
| **TOTAL POTENTIAL** | **$0-$7,500+** | - | - |

### Combined January Revenue Range

| **Realistic** | $8,000-$10,000 | + Invoice Automation + Concrete pilot |

## Time Allocation Assessment (Dec 26 - Jan 4)

### Available Client Project Time: 50 hours (5 hrs/day × 10 days)

| Project | Time Needed | Priority | Allocation |
|---------|-------------|----------|------------|
| **Trevor IDEA** | 16 hours | P0 | ✅ Allocate |
| **Invoice Automation** | 25-30 hours | P0 | ⚠️ Cap at 25 |
| **AntSavvy** | 5-10 hours | P0 | ✅ Allocate |
| **Concrete CEO** | 10-15 hours | P1 | 🔄 If time permits |
| **Plotter Mechanix** | 40-60 hours | P1 | ❌ Too large for sprint |
| **TOTAL P0** | **46-51 hours** | - | **⚠️ OVER BUDGET** |

**Constraint:** 50 hours available, P0 projects need 46-51 hours = NO BUFFER

**Solution:**
- Trevor: 16 hours (deliver Dec 30) ✅
- Invoice: 25 hours max (cap scope, extend if needed) ⚠️
- AntSavvy: 5 hours (close deal, minimal iteration) ✅
- **Total: 46 hours** = 4 hours buffer ✅

**Deferred to Week 2 (Jan 5-11):**
- Concrete CEO proposal (if Week 1 goes well)
- Plotter Mechanix (if Phase 1 closes)
- Other projects in review stage

## Roadmap Status Matrix

| Project | Roadmap Exists? | Next Steps Clear? | Ready to Execute? |
|---------|----------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| **Trevor IDEA** | ✅ YES | ✅ YES | ✅ YES |
| **Invoice Automation** | ⚠️ PARTIAL | ⚠️ BUGS ONLY | ⚠️ RISKY |
| **AntSavvy** | ✅ YES | ✅ YES | ✅ YES |
| **Concrete CEO** | ⚠️ PARTIAL | ⚠️ CONCEPT | ❌ NO |
| **Plotter Mechanix** | ✅ YES | ✅ YES | ⏳ PENDING CLOSE |
| **Remus Development** | ⚠️ PARTIAL | ⏳ WAITING | ❌ NO |
| **S&S Wolf Sheds** | ❓ NOT FOUND | ❓ UNKNOWN | ❓ UNKNOWN |

**Critical Gap:** Invoice Automation needs systematic delivery roadmap (not just bug list)

---

## January Execution Recommendations

### Week 1 (Dec 26 - Jan 1)

**Definite:**
1. ✅ Trevor IDEA (16 hours) - Deliver Dec 30
2. ✅ AntSavvy (5 hours) - Close deal, collect payment
3. ⚠️ Invoice Automation (20-25 hours) - Fix bugs, start testing

**Maybe:**
4. 🔄 Concrete CEO (5 hours) - Draft proposal if Week 1 finishes early

**Defer:**
5. ❌ Plotter Mechanix - Too large, wait for close confirmation
6. ❌ Remus - Nurture only, no delivery expected

### Week 2 (Jan 2-8)

**Definite:**
1. ✅ Invoice Automation (finish if extended from Week 1)
2. ✅ Goldfinch (final 24 hours, submit Jan 4)

**Maybe:**
3. 🔄 Concrete CEO - Pitch to Tyler if proposal ready
4. 🔄 Other projects from review stage (if time allows)

## Strategic Insights

### What's Working
- **Trevor:** Clear roadmap, responsive client, straightforward delivery
- **AntSavvy:** Demo delivered, payment committed, simple close
- **Roadmaps exist:** Trevor, AntSavvy, Plotter all have execution plans

### What's Risky
- **Invoice Automation:** Complex bugs, accuracy critical, scope creep risk
- **Time Budget:** P0 projects = 46 hours, only 50 available (tight)
- **Missing roadmaps:** Concrete CEO and Remus need execution plans

### What's Missing
- **S&S Wolf Sheds:** Can't assess without project files
- **Systematic roadmap for Invoice:** Bug list ≠ delivery roadmap
- **Other projects in review:** Need inventory (Dec 25 evening task)

---

## Recommendations for January Plan

### Adjust Time Allocations:

**Current Plan (From January 2026 doc):**
- Goldfinch: 80 hours ✅
- Trevor: 16 hours ✅
- Invoice: 25 hours ✅
- Other: 14 hours for 2 projects ⚠️

**Recommended Adjustment:**
- Goldfinch: 80 hours ✅
- Trevor: 16 hours ✅
- Invoice: 25 hours (capped) ✅
- AntSavvy: 5 hours ✅
- Buffer: 4 hours ✅
- **Total: 50 hours client work** ✅

**Defer from "Other Projects" category:**
- Concrete CEO → Proposal only (5 hours max)
- Plotter → Wait for close confirmation
- Other Review Projects → Week 2 (Jan 5-11)

### Add Missing Elements:

1. **Invoice Automation Roadmap:** Create systematic delivery plan (not just bug list)
2. **S&S Wolf Sheds:** Locate and assess
3. **Review Stage Projects:** Inventory tonight (Dec 25 6-8 PM session)

---

## Final January Revenue Projection (Adjusted)

### With Goldfinch + Client Projects:

| Scenario | Goldfinch | Client Projects | **Total Personal** | **Agency (4x)** |
|----------|-----------|-----------------|-------------------|----------------|

| **Realistic** | $4,000 | $8,000 | **$12,000** | **$48,000** |
| **Optimistic** | $4,000 | $11,500 | **$15,500** | **$62,000** |
