## Daily Questions

1. Did I generate revenue today?
2. Did I act as Architect or coder?
3. Did I charge for my time?
4. Is there a deal I should be closing?
5. Am I building production code I should delegate?

---

## Anti-Priorities This Month

- Free discovery calls
- Building production code myself
- YouTube/content scaling
- Inbound optimization
- Perfectionism
- Anything that doesn't drive revenue

---

**Remember:** You are the Architect.
Diagnose → Prototype → Scope → Price → Delegate → Manage → Collect
