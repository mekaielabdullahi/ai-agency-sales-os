## Risks & Mitigation

### Risk 1: Plotter doesn't convert to paid
**Mitigation:** Show extensive free work value, clear ROI in proposal, flexible payment terms

### Risk 2: Overdue demos damage client relationships
**Mitigation:** Complete THIS WEEK (Dec 11-13), prioritize P0 over infrastructure

### Risk 3: Audio platform development distracts from revenue
**Mitigation:** December is planning only, actual development Q1 2026

### Risk 4: Too many priorities dilute focus
**Mitigation:** P0 first always, defer P2+ if capacity constrained

---

## Daily Priority Check (December)

**Before starting work each day:**

1. ✅ **Overdue demos done?** → If no, do them first
2. ✅ **Plotter deliverables on track?** → Process map, matrix, audit
3. ✅ **SOP service ready to sell?** → Templates, pricing, process
4. ⏳ **Client conversations progressing?** → Chris's 10+ recordings processed
5. ⏳ **Infrastructure being built?** → Engagement framework, qualification criteria

---

## Month-End Review (Dec 31)

**Questions to answer:**
- Did we achieve P0 objectives? (Case study, SOP service, demos)
- Is engagement framework documented and ready?
- Did Plotter convert to paid work?
- What revenue did we generate?
- Are we on track for Month 1 of OBG?
- What's working? What needs adjustment?

---

## The December Commitment

**"December is about PROOF - proving the agency model works, proving SOPs are valuable, proving we can close and deliver. Everything else is secondary."**

**Success = Plotter converts + SOP service launched + Overdue commitments closed**
