**Goal:** Set up $12,000-$15,000 personal revenue / $48,000-$60,000 agency revenue

## Risk Management

### High-Risk Items

**1. Invoice Automation Scope Creep**
- **Risk:** Bugs could take 30-40 hours instead of 25
- **Mitigation:** Cap at 30 hours. If not done, defer to Week 2 (Jan 5-11)
- **Impact:** Could delay $2,500 payment to late Jan

**2. Goldfinch Completion Delay**
- **Risk:** Project takes longer than 80 hours
- **Mitigation:** Track daily progress. If behind, reduce client project time
- **Impact:** Payment delay to mid-Jan, affects cash flow

**3. Trevor Phase 3 Scope Unclear**
- **Risk:** "Beta-ready" means more than documented roadmap
- **Mitigation:** Confirm scope with Trevor Dec 26. Lock in deliverables.
- **Impact:** Could consume extra 5-10 hours

### Medium-Risk Items

**4. Other Projects in Worse Shape Than Expected**
- **Risk:** Review reveals major gaps, can't ship in 5-7 hours
- **Mitigation:** Inventory thoroughly Dec 25 evening. Only commit to shippable projects.
- **Impact:** Revenue from "Other Projects" = $0 instead of $4k-7k

**5. Client Payment Delays**
- **Risk:** Invoices sent but payments slow
- **Mitigation:** Follow up proactively. Clear payment terms upfront.
- **Impact:** January revenue realized in February

---

## Contingency Plans

### If Invoice Automation Drags (>30 hours):
- **Action:** Pause at 30 hours, move to Week 2 (Jan 5-11)
- **Impact:** Frees up 5-10 hours for Other Projects
- **Trade-off:** $2,500 payment delayed to late Jan

### If Goldfinch Behind Schedule:
- **Action:** Reduce client project time to 2-3 hours/day
- **Priority:** Goldfinch revenue is baseline, protect it
- **Impact:** Fewer client projects shipped

### If Trevor Travels Before Delivery:
- **Action:** Async delivery (video walkthrough, documentation)
- **Impact:** Payment might delay to when Trevor returns
- **Mitigation:** Get 50% upfront confirmed before Dec 26

## Decision Points

### Dec 25 Evening (6-8 PM): Project Inventory
**Decision:** Which 2 "Other Projects" to prioritize for P1 delivery?

**Criteria:**
1. What's closest to shippable? (highest priority)
2. What has highest revenue potential?
3. What builds best client relationship?

**Action:** Update projects-in-review-tracker.md with selections

---

### Dec 26 Morning: Confirm Trevor Scope
**Decision:** Is Trevor's "beta-ready" definition aligned with roadmap?

**Action:** Quick call/message to confirm Phase 3 deliverables

---

### Dec 30: Assess Invoice Progress
**Decision:** Is 98% accuracy achievable by Jan 2, or do we extend to Week 2?

**Criteria:**
- If 90%+ accuracy by Dec 30 → Push to Jan 2
- If <90% accuracy → Extend to Jan 5-8

---

### Jan 4: Goldfinch Status Check
**Decision:** Submit goldfinch or extend 1-2 days?

**Criteria:**
- If 95%+ complete → Submit
- If 80-94% complete → Extend to Jan 5-6
- If <80% complete → Re-assess time allocation

---

## Strategic Alignment

### With OBG ($50k/month × 3 months)

**January Performance:**
- Personal: $12,000-$15,000
- Agency: $48,000-$60,000
- **Target Achievement: 96%-120%** ✅

**Path to Sustained $50k/month:**
- January: Deliver on existing pipeline ($48k-60k)
- February: Repeat + add 1-2 new clients ($50k+)
- March: Sustain and scale ($50k+)

**Key Insight:** January proves we can hit OBG. February sustains it. March validates it.

---

### With Delivery Bottleneck Insight

**Old Mindset:** Build more projects → Revenue
**New Mindset:** Ship existing projects → Revenue

**January Execution:**
- Focus on DELIVERY (review/test/ship)
- Not on BUILDING (new features, new projects)
- AutoClaude built the roadmaps → Now execute and deliver

**This aligns perfectly with January plan:** Finish what's started, get paid, move to next.
