# Strategic Priorities

## OBG: $50k/month for 3+ consecutive months

All work must drive toward this. Everything else is deferred.

---

## Your Role: The Architect

| You ARE | You are NOT |
|---------|-------------|
| Diagnoser of business problems | A coder-for-hire |
| Prototyper (vibe coding) | A freelancer |
| Scoper and estimator | Someone who builds everything |
| Developer evaluator | Someone who grinds production |
| Margin protector | A service monkey |
| Quality enforcer | |
| Developer trainer | |

**Your value = knowing what code is needed, who should build it, what it should cost, and ensuring it's done right.**

---

## Priority Hierarchy

**Full Roadmap:** See ROADMAP-P1-P5.md in relevant project folder

### P0: Revenue-Generating Activities (Non-Negotiable)

**Close deals and deliver projects with margin.**

- Run diagnostic calls ($200-500/hr - NO more free discovery)
- Prototype to validate demand (vibe coding)
- Scope and price projects
- Manage active client projects to completion
- Collect payments

**Active P0 Projects:**
- **Plotter Mechanix** - First proof of concept for 3-tier engagement model ($5K Phase 1 paid)
- **S&S Wolf Sheds** - Multi-location operations + website rebuild ($10K committed)
- **SOP Creation Service** - Productized offering (audio → SOP in 48 hours, $500-750 per SOP)

**New Revenue Model (Dec 10-11 Partner Meetings):**
- **3-Tier Engagement:** Free initial audit → Low-cost entry ($3-5K) → Scale ($10K+/month)
- **SOP Service:** Audio/video → transcription → structured SOP → $500-750 per SOP
- **Case Study Strategy:** Plotter Mechanix validates entire agency model

*If it doesn't generate revenue, question whether it should be done.*

---

### P1: Agency Infrastructure

**Build the machine that produces revenue.**

**Engagement Framework (Dec 10 Meeting):**
- [x] **3-Tier Engagement Model** - Free Audit → Low-Cost → Scale (documented)
- [ ] **Trent's 3-Step AI Audit Framework** - Stakeholder Interviews → End-User Interviews → Readiness Survey (templates needed)
- [ ] **Pricing Model Documentation** - Define pricing for all three tiers
- [ ] **Client Qualification Framework** - Criteria for selecting high-value clients (Dec 11 decision)

**Documentation & Media Services (Dec 11 Meeting):**
- [x] **SOP Creation Service** - Productized (audio → SOP, 48-hour delivery)
- [ ] **Audio-to-SOP Platform** - Web portal for automated processing (Q1 2026)
- [ ] **Deliverable Standards** - Templates for process maps, opportunity matrices, SOPs

**Original Infrastructure:**
- [ ] Define roles with Linh and Mikael
- [ ] Align incentives (revenue splits)
- [ ] Build developer evaluation criteria
- [ ] Establish margin protection standards
- [x] **Meeting note capture system** - IMPLEMENTED (Dec 11: new workflow active)

---

### P2: Developer Pipeline & Capability Building

**Recruit, evaluate, and manage developers.**

**Technology Development (Dec 11 Meeting):**
- [ ] **Mobile Recording App** - Seamless field recording for clients (Q2 2026)
- [ ] **Partner NCP Sandboxes** - Individual AI tool environments for experimentation

**Original Pipeline:**
- [ ] Create developer vetting process
- [ ] Build relationships with capable devs (Mike identified for Plotter implementation)
- [ ] Negotiate rates
- [ ] Establish delivery standards
- [ ] Document what "good" looks like
- [ ] **Discord code sessions Q&A** - document everything in real-time (adopt Mikael's system) → leads developers to be able to replicate your work

---

### P3: Developer Academy Foundation

**Long-term moat: train developers who feed into agency.**

"I Code My Business" program:
- Automation fundamentals
- Build tutorials with real case studies
- Scoping and estimation training
- Cost-based pricing education
- **Documentation pipeline** - Discord sessions → documented processes → academy content (capture live problem-solving as training material)

*Developers learn → trust you → want projects → feed into ecosystem*

---

### P4: Credibility Assets (Supports P0)

**Demo videos and case studies that help close deals.**

**Active/Due:**
- [ ] **Plotter Mechanix Transformation Demo** - Showcase SOP creation process
- [ ] **Case Study: Plotter Mechanix** - First flagship client
- [ ] **S&S Wolf Sheds Case Study** - Multi-location operations transformation

**Framework:**
- Demo videos of working automations
- Quantified results (hours saved, $ value)
- Client testimonials
- Portfolio of proof

*Only matters if it helps close the next deal.*

---

### P5: Scale Preparation (DEFERRED)

**Only after 3 months at $50k/mo:**
- YouTube content scaling
- Inbound lead flow optimization
- Personal brand building
- Content marketing

**Gate:** Do NOT work on this until OBG achieved.

---

## The Agency Flow (Your Workflow)

```
1. Linh/Mikael bring lead
   ↓
2. You run diagnostic call (BILLABLE: $200-500/hr)
   ↓
3. You vibe code a prototype
   ↓
4. Client says YES → You scope and price
   ↓
5. You find/evaluate developer
   ↓
6. You add margin (dev cost + your margin + sales fee)
   ↓
7. You manage delivery to completion
   ↓
8. Collect payment → Repeat
```

---

## Priority Decision Matrix

| Situation | Action |
|-----------|--------|
| Lead comes in | Run diagnostic (bill for it) |
| Client wants solution | Prototype to validate |
| Prototype approved | Scope, price, find dev |
| Project in progress | Manage delivery, enforce quality |
| Need more devs | Recruit and evaluate |
| Want to make content | STOP - does it close a deal? |
| New tool idea | STOP - does it generate revenue? |

---

## Daily Priority Check

Before starting work:

1. **Does this close a deal or get paid?** → Do it
2. **Does this deliver a client project?** → Do it
3. **Does this recruit/manage developers?** → Do it
4. **Does this build the dev academy?** → Do it (lower priority)
5. **Is this content/inbound work?** → DEFER until $50k/mo hit

---

## Anti-Priorities (Kill List)

Until $50k/mo achieved for 3 months:

- Free discovery calls (charge $200-500/hr)
- Building production code yourself (recruit devs)
- YouTube content scaling
- Inbound optimization
- Personal brand building
- "Nice to have" features
- Perfectionism on non-revenue work
- Grinding as a coder instead of architecting

---

## Revenue Math

**Target:** $50k/month

| Activity | Rate/Value | Volume Needed |
|----------|------------|---------------|
| Client projects | $10k avg (with margin) | 5/month |
| Diagnostic calls | $300/hr avg | 10-20 hrs/month |
| Developer Academy | Future revenue | Building now |

**Margin Example:**
```
Client pays:        $10,000
Developer cost:     -$4,000
Sales commission:   -$2,000
Your margin:        $4,000
```

5 projects × $4k margin = $20k/month from management alone
+ diagnostic revenue + future academy = $50k achievable

---

## Weekly Priority Review

### Revenue Check
- [ ] Deals in pipeline?
- [ ] Diagnostic calls scheduled?
- [ ] Active projects on track?
- [ ] Payments collected?

### Agency Infrastructure Check
- [ ] Roles clear with team?
- [ ] Developer pipeline healthy?
- [ ] Margins protected?

### Discipline Check
- [ ] Avoided coding production myself?
- [ ] Charged for diagnostic time?
- [ ] Stayed out of content/inbound work?

---

## The Simple Rule

```
Revenue first. Everything else later.

You are the Architect, not the builder.
Diagnose → Prototype → Scope → Price → Delegate → Manage → Collect

$50k/mo × 3 months → THEN scale with content.
```
