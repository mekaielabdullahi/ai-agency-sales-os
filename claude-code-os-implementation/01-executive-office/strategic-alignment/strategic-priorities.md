## 🔝 Current Strategic Priorities

### Quarter: Q{{QUARTER}} {{YEAR}}

#### Priority Level 1: OBG-Critical
**These directly advance the OBG and must happen**

1. **{{P1_ITEM_1}}**
   - OBG Impact: {{P1_IMPACT_1}}
   - Deadline: {{P1_DEADLINE_1}}
   - Owner: {{P1_OWNER_1}}

2. **{{P1_ITEM_2}}**
   - OBG Impact: {{P1_IMPACT_2}}
   - Deadline: {{P1_DEADLINE_2}}
   - Owner: {{P1_OWNER_2}}
   - Status: {{P1_STATUS_2}}

   - Deadline: {{P2_DEADLINE_3}}
   - Status: {{P2_STATUS_3}}

---

#### Priority Level 3: Maintenance & Operations
**These keep the lights on but don't advance OBG**

1. **{{P3_ITEM_1}}** - {{P3_FREQ_1}}
2. **{{P3_ITEM_2}}** - {{P3_FREQ_2}}

## 🎯 Priority Alignment Test

### The Daily Question
**Every task must answer**: "Which priority does this serve?"

| Task | Priority Level | OBG Connection | Keep/Kill |
|------|---------------|----------------|-----------|
| {{TASK_1}} | {{LEVEL_1}} | {{CONN_1}} | {{KEEP_1}} |
| {{TASK_2}} | {{LEVEL_2}} | {{CONN_2}} | {{KEEP_2}} |
| {{TASK_3}} | {{LEVEL_3}} | {{CONN_3}} | {{KEEP_3}} |

**Rule**: If it doesn't connect to P1 or P2, question whether it should exist.

## 🎪 Resource Allocation

### Time Allocation by Priority

| P1 (OBG-Critical) | {{P1_TARGET}}% | {{P1_ACTUAL}}% | {{P1_VAR}}% |
| P2 (Strategic) | {{P2_TARGET}}% | {{P2_ACTUAL}}% | {{P2_VAR}}% |
| P3 (Maintenance) | {{P3_TARGET}}% | {{P3_ACTUAL}}% | {{P3_VAR}}% |
| P4 (Other) | {{P4_TARGET}}% | {{P4_ACTUAL}}% | {{P4_VAR}}% |

**Target**: 60%+ on P1, 25% on P2, 15% or less on P3+P4

## 🔄 Priority Review Cadence

### Weekly Priority Check
**Every Monday**:
- [ ] Are P1 priorities still correct?
- [ ] Any new P1 items emerged?
- [ ] Any P1 items to remove/deprioritize?
- [ ] Time allocation aligned?

### Monthly Priority Review
**Last Sunday of Month**:
- [ ] OBG still correct?
- [ ] P1 priorities still aligned with OBG?
- [ ] P2 priorities still relevant?
- [ ] Strategic drift check
- [ ] Update priorities document

### Quarterly Strategy Reset
**Week before new quarter**:
- [ ] Set new OBG
- [ ] Redefine all priorities
- [ ] Establish new focus areas
- [ ] Update not-to-do list
- [ ] Communicate changes

## 📊 Priority Decision Framework

### When New Opportunity/Request Arises

```
NEW REQUEST: {{REQUEST}}

Step 1: OBG Alignment Check
Does this advance our OBG? YES / NO / MAYBE
If NO → Decline

Step 2: Priority Level Assessment
If YES, which priority level?
- P1 (OBG-Critical)
- P2 (Strategic Support)
- P3 (Maintenance)

Step 3: Capacity Check
Do we have capacity for this priority level? YES / NO
If NO → Defer or decline

Step 4: Trade-Off Analysis
What must we stop doing to do this?
Trade: {{TRADE_OFF}}
Worth it? YES / NO

Step 5: Decision
ACCEPT / DEFER / DECLINE
```

## 🎯 Alignment Verification

### Daily Alignment
**Morning**: "Does THE ONE THING align with P1 priorities?"
**Evening**: "Did today advance P1 priorities?"

### Weekly Alignment
**Sunday**: "Did this week's work align with priorities?"
**Alignment Score**: ____/10

### Monthly Alignment
**Month End**: "Did this month advance strategic priorities?"
**Strategic Drift**: ____% (target: <10%)

---

## 💡 Strategic Principles

### Principle 1: Focus
**"Do less, better"**
- Fewer priorities = More progress
- 3 P1 priorities maximum
- Everything else is secondary

### Principle 2: Alignment
**"Every action supports the strategy"**
- If it doesn't support P1 or P2, question it
- Daily work must connect to weekly priorities
- Weekly work must connect to OBG

### Principle 3: Constraint
**"Identify and break the bottleneck"**
- Only ONE thing is the true constraint
- P1 priorities should target the constraint
- Remove constraint, find next one

### Principle 4: Trade-offs
**"Saying yes to one thing means no to others"**
- Every "yes" requires explicit "no"s
- Opportunity cost must be worth it
- Protect P1 priorities fiercely

### Principle 5: Flexibility
**"Fixed on what, flexible on how"**
- OBG: Fixed for 90 days
- Priorities: Fixed for 30 days
- Tactics: Flexible daily

## 🚨 Priority Red Flags

### Warning Signs of Misalignment

- [ ] Can't clearly state top 3 priorities
- [ ] P1 priorities haven't changed in weeks (while making no progress)
- [ ] Spending <40% time on P1 items
- [ ] Daily work feels disconnected from strategy
- [ ] Constantly reacting vs. proactively executing
- [ ] OBG progress stalled
- [ ] Everything feels "urgent and important"

**If any checked**: Stop and realign priorities.
