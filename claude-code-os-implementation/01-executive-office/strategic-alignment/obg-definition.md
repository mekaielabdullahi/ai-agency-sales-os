# OBG (One Big Goal) Definition Framework

---

## 🎯 What is an OBG?

**OBG = One Big Obsessional Goal**

Your OBG is the **single most important objective** you must achieve in the next 90 days that will make everything else easier or unnecessary.

---

## 📋 OBG Characteristics

A proper OBG must be:

### 1. **Singular**
- ONE goal, not three
- ONE obsession, not scattered focus
- If you have multiple "OBGs", you have zero OBG

### 2. **Measurable**
- Clear success criteria
- Quantifiable outcome
- Unambiguous completion state

### 3. **Time-Bound**
- 90-day window (one quarter)
- Specific deadline
- Urgent enough to command daily attention

### 4. **Constraint-Breaking**
- Removes your biggest bottleneck
- Unlocks multiple opportunities
- Creates leverage for future goals

### 5. **Obsession-Worthy**
- Important enough to think about daily
- Meaningful enough to sacrifice for
- Exciting enough to maintain motivation

## 🔨 OBG Creation Process

### Step 1: Brain Dump (10 minutes)
List everything you think is important to achieve:

```
1. ___________________________________
2. ___________________________________
3. ___________________________________
4. ___________________________________
5. ___________________________________
[continue...]
```

---

### Step 2: The Brutal Question (5 minutes)
**For each item, ask**: "If I could only achieve ONE of these, which would it be?"

**Your answer**: ___________________________________

---

### Step 3: The Constraint Test (5 minutes)
**Ask**: "What is my biggest constraint right now?"

**Answer**: ___________________________________

**Ask**: "Does my ONE thing break this constraint?"

**Answer**: Yes / No

**If NO**: Reconsider your ONE thing.

---

### Step 4: The Leverage Test (5 minutes)
**Ask**: "If I achieve this ONE thing, what else becomes easier or unnecessary?"

**Answer**:
- ___________________________________
- ___________________________________
- ___________________________________

**If the list is short**: Reconsider your ONE thing.

---

### Step 5: Make it Measurable (5 minutes)
Convert your goal into a specific, measurable outcome.

**Template**:
```
Achieve [SPECIFIC METRIC] by [SPECIFIC DATE]
measured by [SPECIFIC MEASUREMENT METHOD]
```

**Examples**:
- ✅ "Launch product to 100 paying customers by March 31"
- ✅ "Increase MRR to $50K by end of Q2"
- ✅ "Ship v1.0 with 5 core features by June 15"
- ❌ "Grow the business" (not specific)
- ❌ "Be more productive" (not measurable)
- ❌ "Launch product soon" (no deadline)

---

### Step 6: The "Hell Yes" Test (2 minutes)
**Ask yourself**: "Am I excited to wake up and work on this every day?"

If it's not a "HELL YES", it's not your OBG.

## 💡 OBG Principles

1. **"One target, one bullet"** - Focus all energy on one goal
2. **"Clarity beats perfection"** - Better to pursue clear goal imperfectly than perfect goal unclearly
3. **"Measure or die"** - If you can't measure it, it's not an OBG
4. **"90 days or bust"** - Shorter creates urgency, longer loses focus
5. **"Obsession is a feature, not a bug"** - Healthy obsession drives results
