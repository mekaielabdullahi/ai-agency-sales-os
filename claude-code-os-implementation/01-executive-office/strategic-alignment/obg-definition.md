# One Big Obsessional Goal (OBG)

## Current OBG

**Goal:** $50k/month revenue consistently for 3+ months

**Timeframe:** November 2025 - Q1 2026

**Success Criteria:**
- [ ] $50k/month achieved
- [ ] Maintained for 3 consecutive months
- [ ] Agency structure operational (sales + architect + developers)
- [ ] Developer funnel producing talent

**After OBG achieved:** Prioritize YouTube content and inbound lead flow to scale.

## Your Role: Builder → Architect (Progression)

### Current Phase: Hands-On Builder
You need to know the ins and outs of client work before you can manage it.

**Now:**
- Deliver client projects yourself
- Build cash flow through direct work
- Learn every component deeply
- Develop quality metrics expertise
- Document what works

**Then (after proven delivery):**
- Scope and price with confidence (because you've done it)
- Delegate to developers (because you know what good looks like)
- Manage quality (because you've built the evals)
- Protect margins (because you know true costs)

### Future Role: The Architect
- Diagnose business problems
- Prototype to validate demand
- Scope, estimate, price
- Recruit and evaluate developers
- Manage delivery and quality
- Train developers (Developer Academy)

**You earn the Architect role by doing the work first.**

## Agency Structure

### Linh (Sales + Relationships)
- Finds businesses
- Opens doors, sets meetings
- Builds trust
- Offers diagnostic calls
- Loops you in when needed
- Manages client relationships

### Mikael (Outbound + Biz Dev)
- Moves fast
- Runs outreach
- Finds operators
- Builds relationships
- Closes smaller deals
- Supports operations

### You (Architect + Estimator + Technical Strategist)
- Diagnose problems
- Prototype solutions (vibe coding)
- Scope and estimate projects
- Recruit and evaluate developers
- Price with margin protection
- Manage delivery and quality
- Train developers (Developer Academy)

---

## The Agency Flow

### 1. Sales / Inbound → Understand the Pain
Linh + Mikael bring leads. You run diagnostic:
- Why are you frustrated?
- What broke? What's inefficient?
- What's costing money/time/energy?
- Why now?

**This conversation is billable at $200-500/hr. No more free discovery.**

### 2. You Build a Quick Prototype (Vibe Coding)
NOT production. Goal: "Do you want THIS or not?"
- YES → scope and quote
- NO → they tell you what they actually want
- NOT EXACT → refine until "YES I WOULD PAY FOR THIS"

**Highest leverage step. Prevents wasted dev time. Gives massive authority.**

### 3. You Scope and Price
Because YOU understand:
- What is hard vs easy
- What is risky vs simple
- What is expensive vs cheap
- How long things take
- Proper architecture
- What fails and what works

**You determine: Timeline, Tech stack, Complexity, Expected cost**

### 4. You Recruit and Evaluate Developers
Detect:
- Do they know what they're talking about?
- Have they built this before?
- Do they understand architecture?
- Are they BSing?
- Do their estimates make sense?
- Will they hit deadlines?

If they pass → negotiate their cost.

### 5. You Add Margin + Deliverables
Example:
```
Developer cost:     $4k
Your margin + mgmt: $4k
Sales fee:          $2k
─────────────────────────
Total to client:    $10k

Developer gets $4k
You keep $6k
Agency wins
Client gets working solution
```

### 6. You Manage to Completion
- Timestamp enforcer
- Deliverables tracker
- Technical reviewer
- "Does this actually work?" validator

## The Developer Academy ("I Code My Business")

**Your long-term moat.** You're not just finding developers - you're creating a training program that produces them.

Teach:
- Automation fundamentals
- How to build each automation type
- Real case studies and systems
- Best practices and architectures
- Common pitfalls and system design
- Quote scoping and estimation
- Cost-based pricing

**Developers learn → trust you → want projects → feed into agency ecosystem**

This is why your agency becomes unstoppable.

## Revenue Path to $50k/month

| Source | Target |
|--------|--------|
| Client projects (with margin) | $30-40k |
| Diagnostic calls ($200-500/hr) | $5-10k |
| Developer Academy (future) | $5-10k |

---

## OBG Alignment Check

For any task, ask:
```
Does this contribute to $50k/month revenue?
1. Does it bring in a client? → YES/NO
2. Does it close a deal? → YES/NO
3. Does it improve delivery/margins? → YES/NO
4. Does it build the developer funnel? → YES/NO

If NO to all → This task is NOT aligned. Eliminate or defer.
```

---

## What's DEFERRED Until OBG Hit

- YouTube content scaling
- Inbound lead flow optimization
- Personal brand building
- Anything that doesn't directly drive revenue

**After 3 months at $50k/mo:** Then focus on content and inbound to scale.
