# Agency Roadmap: P1-P5 (Post-AntSavvy Deal)

**Last Updated:** November 29, 2025
**Context:** After closing AntSavvy (P0), this roadmap guides the next priorities toward $50k/mo OBG.

---

## P1: Agency Infrastructure (Jan-Feb 2026)

**Goal:** Formalize roles, splits, templates so next deals close faster.

### What Gets Built
- [ ] **Role documentation:** Linh (sales), Mikael (outbound), You (architect)
- [ ] **Revenue split agreement:** Who gets what % of each deal type
- [ ] **Diagnostic call template:** Reusable structure for client discovery calls
- [ ] **Scope/pricing calculator:** Standard margins, developer cost estimates
- [ ] **Project handoff template:** How you pass builds to developers

### Why P1
- AntSavvy taught us the process
- Formalizing it makes deals 2-5 faster to close
- Prevents "making it up each time" chaos

### Timeline
- **Jan 1-15:** Document roles and splits (consensus with Linh/Mikael)
- **Jan 16-31:** Create diagnostic call template, test on next lead
- **Feb 1-15:** Scope/pricing calculator based on AntSavvy margins
- **Feb 16-28:** Project handoff template, ready for developer delegation

### Success Criteria
- Next deal closes with <50% the friction of AntSavvy
- Margins are consistent (50-70%)
- Everyone knows their role and compensation

## P2: Developer Pipeline (Feb-Apr 2026)

**Goal:** Recruit 3-5 vetted developers so you stop building production yourself.

### What Gets Built
- [ ] **Developer job posting:** "Build AI automation for our clients"
- [ ] **Technical evaluation:** Code test for n8n, Claude API, automation skills
- [ ] **Developer onboarding doc:** How they receive scopes, deliver builds, get paid
- [ ] **Quality checklist:** Standards for accepting developer work
- [ ] **Developer roster:** 3-5 reliable builders on standby

### Why P2
- You're the Architect, not the builder
- Developer Academy (P3) requires people to train
- Margins improve when you delegate production

### Timeline
- **Feb 1-15:** Draft job posting, publish to Upwork/freeCodeCamp/Twitter
- **Feb 16-28:** Create technical evaluation (n8n workflow + Claude API test)
- **Mar 1-15:** Onboard first 2 developers, test with small projects
- **Mar 16-31:** Refine process, onboard 2-3 more developers
- **Apr 1-30:** Active roster of 3-5 vetted devs, ready for delegation

### Success Criteria
- 3-5 developers vetted and ready
- You delegate 80% of production builds by April
- Quality checklist prevents bad handoffs

## P3: Developer Academy (Apr-Aug 2026)

**Goal:** Launch "I Code My Business" to train non-technical entrepreneurs to build AI automations.

### What Gets Built
- [ ] **Academy curriculum:** 4-week program teaching n8n, Claude API, no-code AI
- [ ] **Demo projects:** Pre-built automations students replicate
- [ ] **Graduation project:** Students build real automation for their business
- [ ] **Community/support:** Discord/Slack for students, office hours
- [ ] **Revenue model:** $500-1k/student, 20-50 students per cohort

### Why P3 (Long-Term Moat)
- Positions you as educator, not just service provider
- Creates developer pipeline (some students become contractors)
- Recurring revenue (cohorts every 2 months)
- Credibility asset (YouTube content from course material)

### Timeline
- **Apr 1-30:** Draft curriculum outline, define 4-week structure
- **May 1-31:** Build demo projects (email assistant, lead scoring, CRM automation)
- **Jun 1-30:** Record first lessons, set up community platform
- **Jul 1-31:** Beta cohort (10 students, discounted price, feedback loop)
- **Aug 1-31:** Refine curriculum, launch full cohort 1 (20-30 students)

### Success Criteria
- 20-30 students in first full cohort
- $10k-30k revenue from academy (supplemental to client work)
- 2-3 students become contract developers for agency

---

## P4: Credibility Assets (Ongoing, As Needed)

**Goal:** Build demo videos and case studies that close deals faster.

### What Gets Built
- [ ] **AntSavvy case study:** "How we saved 10 hours/week for accounts dept"
- [ ] **Trevor brand consultation demo:** "AI-powered brand questionnaires"
- [ ] **Email assistant demo:** Reusable for similar clients
- [ ] **Lead scoring demo:** Show how AI qualifies leads automatically
- [ ] **Demo library:** 5-10 pre-built automations prospects can see

### Why P4
- Demos close deals faster than pitches
- Reusable across similar client industries
- Content for Developer Academy lessons
- Foundation for YouTube scaling (P5)

### Timeline
- **Ongoing:** After each client project, record 3-5min demo
- **By Mar 2026:** 3 polished demos (AntSavvy, Trevor, +1)
- **By Jun 2026:** 5-7 demos covering common use cases
- **By Sep 2026:** 10+ demos, organized by industry/problem

### Success Criteria
- Demos reduce diagnostic call time by 30%
- Prospects say "I want that one" instead of "explain what you do"
- Demo library becomes Developer Academy curriculum base

---

## P5: Content/Inbound Scaling (DEFERRED Until OBG)

**Goal:** YouTube channel, inbound leads, scale to $100k+/mo.

### What Gets Built
- [ ] **YouTube channel:** Weekly AI automation tutorials, case studies
- [ ] **Lead magnet:** Free guide to "AI automations every business needs"
- [ ] **Webinar funnel:** Monthly live training → upsell to academy or services
- [ ] **SEO content:** Blog posts targeting "AI automation for [industry]"
- [ ] **Partnerships:** Collaborate with other AI educators/agencies

### Why P5 (But Not Yet)
- YouTube is the long-term scale play
- Inbound leads are cheaper than outbound
- Content positions you as authority
- **BUT:** Only after $50k/mo × 3 months (OBG achieved)

### Timeline
- **NOT BEFORE SEP 2026** (assumes OBG hit by Jun 2026)
- **Sep 2026:** Launch YouTube, publish first 10 videos from academy content
- **Oct 2026:** Weekly publishing cadence, optimize for inbound leads
- **Nov 2026:** First inbound clients from YouTube discovery
- **Dec 2026:** Scale content production, hire video editor

### Success Criteria
- 10k+ YouTube subscribers by Dec 2026
- 30% of new clients from inbound (vs outbound)
- $100k+/mo revenue (client work + academy + inbound)

## Decision Framework: What to Work On Today

```
1. Is there an active deal to close? → Work on P0 (revenue NOW)
2. Is there a pipeline gap blocking next deal? → Work on P1 (infrastructure)
3. Are you building production yourself? → Work on P2 (developer pipeline)
4. Is OBG achieved ($50k/mo × 3 months)? → Work on P3/P4 (academy, demos)
5. Is everything else solid? → Work on P5 (content scaling)
```

### Example Scenarios

**Scenario 1:** AntSavvy wants more features after MVP ships
→ **P0 priority:** Scope expansion, price it, delegate to developer (P2 if needed)

**Scenario 2:** Linh brings new lead, diagnostic call next week
→ **P1 priority:** Use diagnostic call template, refine based on AntSavvy learnings

**Scenario 3:** You're coding n8n workflows for 3rd client in a row
→ **P2 priority:** Stop. Recruit developer, delegate production builds

**Scenario 4:** Hit $50k/mo for first time in May 2026
→ **Still P0-P2:** Don't celebrate yet, need 3 consecutive months

**Scenario 5:** Hit $50k/mo for 3 months straight (OBG achieved)
→ **P3-P5 unlocked:** Launch Developer Academy, scale YouTube content

---

## The Simple Rule (Redux)

```
P0 = Revenue NOW (active deals)
P1 = Infrastructure (close deals faster)
P2 = Developer pipeline (stop building yourself)
P3 = Developer Academy (long-term moat)
P4 = Credibility assets (demos that close)
P5 = Content scaling (ONLY after OBG)

Always ask: "Does this move me toward $50k/mo × 3 months?"
If no → Defer it.
```

---

## Roadmap Review Cadence

- **Daily:** Check P0 progress (active deals moving?)
- **Weekly:** Review P1 status (infrastructure gaps blocking deals?)
- **Monthly:** Assess P2-P3 progress (developer pipeline, academy prep)
- **Quarterly:** Evaluate OBG trajectory (on track for $50k/mo?)

---

**Bottom Line:** P0 (AntSavvy) closes before Christmas. P1-P2 build infrastructure and developer pipeline (Jan-Apr). P3-P4 launch academy and demos (Apr-Aug). P5 deferred until OBG achieved. Every priority serves the $50k/mo × 3 months goal.
