## 4. Which best describes you right now?
**A: Already delivering paid AI audits for clients**

---

## 5. Do you have an audit lined up for January 2026?
**A: Yes, it's scheduled**

### Client Details:

Plotter Mechanix is a $600-750K plotter repair company with a 9-person team. The owner (Kelce) is at 100% capacity and acts as a single point of failure for operations. We ran 7 discovery calls, mapped their workflows, and scoped Phase 1 (30-day) deliverables:

**Deliverable 1: Main Operating System** — 4 documented SOPs (how to handle service calls, process invoices, dispatch service calls, job handoff) plus a system for Kelce to record himself and auto-generate how-to guides for his team.

**Deliverable 2: Three Smart Automations** — Daily 4PM summary of unanswered Jobber messages, instant alerts when new customers are added, and 5:30PM end-of-day job summaries with customer/work/photos/billing status.

**Deliverable 3: Job Completion Checklist** — Mobile form Kelce fills out in 2 minutes at the job site (work done, materials, next steps, customer notes, photos). Saves 30+ minutes/day by eliminating phone calls to the office.

We also signed S&S Wolfsheds with a similar Phase 1 scope. Our audit insights are baked into implementation—we deliver results in 30 days, not standalone reports.

## 6. How many audits have you completed so far?
2

---

## 7. Typical price point for your audits?
$5,000

---

## 8. Can you commit to weekly calls for 6-8 weeks?
**[YOUR ANSWER: A or B]**

- A: Yes, I'm all in
- B: Not sure

---

## 8. Why do you want to be part of this beta program?

**[YOUR ANSWER - Draft below:]**

We closed our first paid client 4 weeks after launching AriseGroup.ai, but we built the methodology ourselves through trial and error. I want to learn from people who've scaled this—to tighten our audit process, improve how we scope and price, and build the consistency to go from 1-2 audits to 5-10 per month. This program would accelerate what took us a month of figuring out on our own.

---

## 9. Anything else you'd like to share?

I'm not a solo operator—AriseGroup.ai is a 4-person equity partnership. Chris handles lead generation and client relationships, Trent and Matthew lead technical discovery and delivery, and I handle systems architecture and operations infrastructure (discovery frameworks, audit templates, opportunity matrices, AI-assisted transcript analysis). We closed our first $5K client in Week 4 by building systems before chasing revenue. Our methodology includes structured discovery calls, pain point quantification from call transcripts, prioritized opportunity matrices, and phased implementation roadmaps. We're practitioners—we use Claude and AI tools daily in our own operations, not just for clients.

## Supporting Context

### Our Process (If Asked to Elaborate)

1. **Discovery Call Framework** — 30-minute structured calls with pre-call research, specific question flow, real-time note-taking, and prospect qualification

2. **Transcript Analysis & Pain Extraction** — Record and transcribe calls, extract quantified pain points, map to business functions

3. **Opportunity Matrix Creation** — Plot opportunities on Impact vs Effort grid, score each opportunity, prioritize into phases

4. **Scoped Deliverables** — Phase implementation into 30-day sprints with specific deliverables and success metrics
