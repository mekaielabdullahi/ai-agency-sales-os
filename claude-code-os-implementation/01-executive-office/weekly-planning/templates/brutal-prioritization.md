# Brutal Prioritization Framework

**Purpose**: Ruthlessly eliminate everything except what truly matters.

---

## 🎯 Core Philosophy

**The Rule**: If it's not moving you toward your OBG, it's optional at best, wasteful at worst.

**The Question**: "If I could only do ONE thing this week, what would it be?"

---

## 📋 The Brutal Questions

### Question 1: The Necessity Test
**For each item on your list, ask**:
> "What happens if I don't do this at all?"

- **Nothing bad happens** → ELIMINATE
- **Minor inconvenience** → DEFER
- **Significant setback** → EVALUATE FURTHER
- **Critical failure** → KEEP (maybe)

---

### Question 2: The OBG Alignment Test
**For remaining items**:
> "Does this directly advance my One Big Goal?"

| Response | Action |
|----------|--------|
| Yes, directly | ✅ KEEP - High Priority |
| Yes, indirectly | ⚠️ EVALUATE - Medium Priority |
| Not really | ❌ DEFER or DELEGATE |
| No | ❌ ELIMINATE |

**OBG Scoring**:
- 9-10: Critical path to OBG
- 7-8: Supports OBG significantly
- 4-6: Tangentially related
- 1-3: No real connection
- 0: Actively distracts from OBG

---

### Question 3: The Leverage Test
**For high-priority items**:
> "Will this make everything else easier or unnecessary?"

**High Leverage** = Do this FIRST
**Medium Leverage** = Schedule strategically
**Low Leverage** = Question if needed

---

### Question 4: The Energy ROI Test
> "Is the energy required worth the outcome?"

```
Value Generated / Energy Required = ROI
```

- **High ROI** (>3:1): Do it
- **Medium ROI** (1:1 to 3:1): Schedule carefully
- **Low ROI** (<1:1): Eliminate or delegate

---

### Question 5: The Constraint Test
> "Is this THE constraint blocking everything else?"

**Theory of Constraints**: Only ONE thing is the true bottleneck at any time.

- **Is this the constraint?** YES → Top priority
- **Is this the constraint?** NO → Deprioritize

---

## 🔥 The Brutal Prioritization Process

### Step 1: Brain Dump (5 minutes)
List EVERYTHING you think you should do this week.

```
1. ____________________
2. ____________________
3. ____________________
[... continue ...]
```

---

### Step 2: Apply Necessity Test (5 minutes)
Cross out anything that passes the "nothing bad happens" test.

**Eliminated**: ~30-40% of initial list

---

### Step 3: OBG Alignment Scoring (5 minutes)
Score remaining items 0-10 on OBG alignment.

**Keep only**: Items scoring 7+

**Remaining**: ~20-30% of initial list

---

### Step 4: Identify THE Constraint (2 minutes)
Of the remaining items, which ONE is blocking everything else?

**THE CONSTRAINT**: ____________________

This becomes your **ONE THING** for the week.

---

### Step 5: Critical Path Sequencing (3 minutes)
Of what remains, what's the minimum viable sequence?

```
1. THE CONSTRAINT (THE ONE THING)
2. Next constraint
3. Next constraint
4. Everything else (if time permits)
```

---

### Step 6: Energy Mapping (2 minutes)
Map high-ROI items to high-energy days/times.

| Item | Energy Required | Schedule For |
|------|----------------|--------------|
| {{ITEM_1}} | {{ENERGY_1}} | {{DAY_1}} |
| {{ITEM_2}} | {{ENERGY_2}} | {{DAY_2}} |

## 🚫 The Kill List Rules

### Auto-Kill Categories
These should almost always be eliminated:

1. **Fake Urgency**
   - Appears urgent but isn't important
   - Example: Most emails, meetings, "quick questions"

2. **Busy Work**
   - Makes you feel productive without real output
   - Example: Excessive planning, reorganizing, "research"

3. **Premature Optimization**
   - Perfecting something that doesn't need to exist yet
   - Example: Polish before validation

4. **Scope Creep**
   - "Nice to haves" disguised as requirements
   - Example: Extra features, additional reports

5. **Other People's Priorities**
   - Important to them, not to your OBG
   - Example: Favors, networking for networking's sake

6. **Low-Leverage Learning**
   - Learning without application
   - Example: Courses, books not tied to current OBG

---

## ✅ The Keep List Rules

### Auto-Keep Categories
These usually make the cut:

1. **Constraint Breakers**
   - Directly removes your main bottleneck

2. **OBG Critical Path**
   - Can't reach OBG without it

3. **High-Leverage Actions**
   - One action, multiple benefits

4. **Revenue Generators** (if revenue is OBG-aligned)
   - Directly creates money/progress

5. **System Builders**
   - Creates automation/leverage for future

## 📊 Brutal Prioritization Template

### This Week's List

| Task | Necessity | OBG Score | Leverage | Energy ROI | Constraint? | DECISION |
|------|-----------|-----------|----------|------------|-------------|----------|
| {{TASK_1}} | {{N_1}} | {{OBG_1}} | {{LEV_1}} | {{ROI_1}} | {{CON_1}} | {{DEC_1}} |
| {{TASK_2}} | {{N_2}} | {{OBG_2}} | {{LEV_2}} | {{ROI_2}} | {{CON_2}} | {{DEC_2}} |
| {{TASK_3}} | {{N_3}} | {{OBG_3}} | {{LEV_3}} | {{ROI_3}} | {{CON_3}} | {{DEC_3}} |

**Legend**:
- Necessity: Critical / Important / Nice / Optional
- OBG Score: 0-10
- Leverage: High / Medium / Low
- Energy ROI: High / Medium / Low
- Constraint: Y/N
- DECISION: DO / DEFER / DELEGATE / DELETE

## 🎯 The Final Cut

### Your Week Should Look Like:

**THE ONE THING**: {{WEEK_ONE_THING}}

**Critical Path** (3-5 items max):
1. {{CRITICAL_1}}
2. {{CRITICAL_2}}
3. {{CRITICAL_3}}

**If Time Permits** (2-3 items):
- {{OPTIONAL_1}}
- {{OPTIONAL_2}}

**KILL LIST** (Everything else):
- ❌ {{KILLED_1}}
- ❌ {{KILLED_2}}
- ❌ {{KILLED_3}}

## 💡 Brutal Prioritization Mantras

1. **"If it's not a HELL YES, it's a no."**
2. **"You can do anything, but not everything."**
3. **"What's the ONE thing I can do such that by doing it, everything else becomes easier or unnecessary?"**
4. **"The main thing is to keep the main thing the main thing."**
5. **"Less but better."**
6. **"Essentialism: The disciplined pursuit of less."**

## 🚨 Red Flags - You're Not Being Brutal Enough If:

- [ ] Your list has more than 7 "must do" items
- [ ] You haven't eliminated at least 30% of your initial list
- [ ] You can't clearly state THE ONE THING
- [ ] Multiple items feel equally important
- [ ] You're stressed about fitting it all in
- [ ] You haven't said "no" to anything this week
- [ ] Your calendar is 80%+ full

---

## ✨ The Brutal Truth

**Most of what you think you "must" do is optional.**

**Most of what you do is low leverage.**

**Most of your results come from very few actions.**

**Focus is about saying NO to good things so you can say YES to great things.**

---

## 🔄 Weekly Brutality Check

### Monday Morning

- [ ] Feel slightly uncomfortable with how much I cut

### Wednesday Midweek

### Friday Reflection

- [ ] Was I brutal enough?
- [ ] What snuck back in that shouldn't have?
- [ ] What can I be more brutal about next week?

*"Being busy is a form of laziness - lazy thinking and indiscriminate action." - Tim Ferriss*

*"People think focus means saying yes to the thing you've got to focus on. But that's not what it means at all. It means saying no to the hundred other good ideas." - Steve Jobs*
