## 🎯 CRITICAL SUCCESS FACTORS

### What Must Go Right This Week

**1. Factory Validation is Real**
- Don't fudge the numbers - track actual time
- Document friction points honestly
- If factory doesn't hit <30 min by Friday, that's data (not failure)
- Refinement based on real usage is the goal

**2. Client Value is Deployable**
- Frameworks must be production-ready (not theoretical)
- Test each framework with a scenario
- Ask: "Could I use this with a client Monday?"

**3. Templates Actually Accelerate Work**
- Templates should save time, not add bureaucracy
- Extract patterns that actually repeat
- Make them easy to use (fill-in-the-blank, clear examples)

**4. Content Maintains Momentum**
- Don't let posting slip due to building
- Build-in-public requires the "public" part
- Capture content ideas as you work (notes throughout day)

**5. Strategic Alignment Stays Tight**
- Every task should ladder to OBG: "Scale AriseGroup.ai to sustainable revenue"
- If it doesn't serve clients or revenue, question it
- Week 3 is client deployment - this week preps for that

---

## 🚫 KILL LIST - DO NOT DO THIS WEEK

### What to Avoid

**❌ Perfection Paralysis**
- Don't over-refine agents, frameworks, or templates
- Ship at 80% quality, refine based on usage
- Done > Perfect

**❌ Scope Creep**
- Don't add "just one more" agent beyond the 3 planned
- Don't expand frameworks into 50-page documents
- Stick to the plan

**❌ Content Neglect**
- Don't skip posting because you're "too busy building"
- The build-in-public strategy is working - maintain it
- 30 min/day for content is non-negotiable

**❌ Validation Theater**
- Don't claim factory works if it doesn't
- Don't manipulate time tracking to hit targets
- Real data > fake wins

**❌ Client Delay**
- Don't build "one more thing" before client deployment
- Week 3 = client focus, no excuses
- This week builds what's needed, then stop building

**❌ Strategic Drift**
- Don't chase shiny objects or new ideas
- Don't rebuild what's already working
- Focus on validation + client value

## ⚡ ENERGY MANAGEMENT STRATEGY

### Daily Energy Allocation

**Peak Energy (Mornings)**
- Complex agent creation
- Framework design
- Strategic thinking

**Medium Energy (Early Afternoons)**
- Documentation
- Testing and validation
- Content creation

**Lower Energy (Late Afternoons)**
- Publishing and engagement
- Planning next day
- Admin tasks

### Energy Preservation Tactics

**Breaks are Non-Negotiable**
- 15 min break every 90-120 min
- Actual break: walk, hydrate, stretch (not email/social)

**Context Switching Minimization**
- Batch similar tasks (all content work together, all template extraction together)
- Close Slack/email during deep work blocks
- One task at a time, complete before switching

**Momentum Maintenance**
- Start each day with quick win (15-30 min task)
- Build in public maintains external accountability
- Daily productivity assessments provide feedback loop
