## STRATEGIC CONTEXT: 3.5 WEEKS IN REVIEW

## FEB 1 EVENTBRITE: THE FORCING FUNCTION

### Partnership: Katrina (Triple Accelerator)

**Event Concept:**
- **Topic:** SOPs + Documentation as Foundation → AI Transformation as Next Level
- **Showcase:** Plotter Mechanix delivery as live case study
- **Distribution:** Blast to ALL warm connections - one stop shop launch

**Goals (Multi-Purpose):**
- Authority building (establish AriseGroup as thought leader)
- Lead generation (build email list of potential clients)
- Direct sales (convert attendees to discovery calls)
- Pipeline maximization (activate all warm connections at once)

**Timeline:**
- **Dec 23:** Reach out to Katrina
- **Dec 23-31:** Define event scope and structure
- **Jan 1-15:** Build event content and registration
- **Jan 15-31:** Promote heavily
- **Feb 1:** Launch event with Plotter case study ready

**Why This Matters:**
- Creates deadline for Plotter delivery excellence
- Positions AriseGroup as authority, not just service provider
- One event activates entire warm network
- Partnership model scales (Katrina brings her audience too)

```
Hey Katrina!

Hope you're doing well heading into the holidays.

I've been building AriseGroup.ai - an AI transformation consulting practice - and I have an idea I'd love to run by you.

I'm looking to host an Eventbrite event around Feb 1st focused on:
- Why SOPs and documentation are the foundation for scaling
- How AI transformation builds on that foundation
- Live case study from a current client delivery

Would you be interested in partnering on this? I think combining our networks could create something valuable.

Open to a quick call this week or early January to explore?
```

Hey Kelsey - hope you're doing well!
