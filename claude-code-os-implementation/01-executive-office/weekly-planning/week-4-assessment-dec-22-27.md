## WHAT WORKED

1. **Plotter closed** - First revenue. Proof of concept validated.
2. **Discovery calls executed** - Concrete CEO + SNS Wolf Sheds both progressed
3. **Systems held up** - Framework worked even with Christmas disruption
4. **Partnerships delivering leads** - Chris connection generated new opportunities

---

## WHAT DIDN'T WORK

1. **Content slipped** - No LinkedIn posts published this week
2. **Christmas disruption** - 48-72 hours completely off (expected but impacted momentum)
3. **Katrina outreach** - May not have happened or needs follow-up (verify)

---

## ADJUSTMENTS FOR WEEK 5

1. **Content catch-up** - Publish year-end post immediately, plan January cadence
2. **Proposal execution** - Concrete CEO + SNS Wolf Sheds need proposals finalized
3. **Plotter kickoff** - Schedule and execute first delivery milestone
4. **Partnership follow-up** - Confirm Katrina status for Feb 1 event
