## 🚫 KILL LIST - Do NOT Do Today
Things to actively avoid to maintain focus:

- ❌ Building new features or tools (use what exists)
- ❌ Perfectionism on creative assets (80% quality is enough to launch)
- ❌ Analysis paralysis on targeting (test and iterate)
- ❌ Getting distracted by social media scrolling
- ❌ Rabbit holes in platform settings unrelated to launch

---

## 🎯 Execution Strategy

### Critical Path
```
1. Define ICP & messaging (WHO + WHAT) → 2. Set up campaign infrastructure (WHERE + HOW) → 3. Launch & activate (GO LIVE) → 4. Monitor initial performance
```

### Key Principles for Today
1. **Focus**: Launch beats perfect - get campaign live and iterate based on data
2. **Constraint**: Limited deep work time (2-3 hrs) - protect the morning block
3. **Leverage**: A live campaign generating data beats planning - momentum compounds

### Risk Mitigation
- **Potential Blocker**: Technical setup issues or platform unfamiliarity
  - **Mitigation**: Allocate 60 min buffer, use templates/existing campaigns as baseline
- **Potential Blocker**: Unclear messaging or targeting indecision
  - **Mitigation**: Use existing ICP framework, pick ONE audience segment to test first

## 💭 Strategic Notes

**Campaign Launch Strategy**: Focus on getting a minimum viable campaign live today rather than building the perfect campaign. The goal is to start generating data and feedback that will inform iteration. Target ONE specific ICP segment with ONE clear value proposition. Measure response rate and quality of leads generated.

**Revenue Scale Connection**: This campaign is designed to create a systematic lead generation engine that feeds the sales pipeline. Success = qualified conversations booked, not just vanity metrics.

## 🎬 First Action
**Start with**: Open campaign platform, review ICP scoring system from sales-engine folder, write down 3 specific audience characteristics for targeting
**Expected completion**: 9:45 AM
