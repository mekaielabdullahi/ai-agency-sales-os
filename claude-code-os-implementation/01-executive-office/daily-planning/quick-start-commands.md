## 🎪 Power User Tips

### 1. Batch Planning Context
Create a template with your common context and just update the changing parts:
```markdown
STANDARD CONTEXT:
- OBG: Scale to 100 customers
- Peak energy: 8-10 AM
- Lunch break: 12-1 PM
- END standard

TODAY'S VARIABLES:
- Yesterday: [Quick update]
- Meetings: [Today's specific]
- Priority: [Today's focus]
```

### 2. Stack Commands
```bash
"Generate daily plan AND create calendar blocks AND set focus mode reminders"
```

### 3. Theme Days
```bash
# Monday = Planning
"Generate Monday roadmap with focus on weekly planning and setup"

# Tuesday = Building
"Generate Tuesday roadmap optimized for deep work and building"

# Wednesday = Communicating
"Generate Wednesday roadmap with time for meetings and collaboration"

# Thursday = Shipping
"Generate Thursday roadmap focused on deployment and delivery"

# Friday = Improving
"Generate Friday roadmap with review, optimization, and next week prep"
```

### 4. Energy Patterns
```bash
# Track your patterns
"My energy pattern: Peak 8-10, Good 10-12, Crash 2-3, Recovery 3-5. Plan accordingly."
```

## 🚨 Emergency Commands

### Complete Do-Over
```bash
"It's 2 PM and nothing went as planned. Generate recovery plan for remaining hours."
```

### Sick Day Adjustment
```bash
"Feeling sick. Generate minimum viable plan. Only absolutely critical tasks."
```

### Weekend Catch-Up
```bash
"Working Saturday morning, 4 hours available. What's the highest impact from missed week items?"
```

## 💡 Pro Configuration

### Set Your Defaults
Create a `planning-defaults.md` file:
```markdown
DEFAULT_OBG: "Scale to 100 customers by Q2"
DEFAULT_PEAK_HOURS: "8-10 AM"
DEFAULT_LUNCH: "12-1 PM"
DEFAULT_WORKDAY_END: "5:30 PM"
DEFAULT_ENERGY_PATTERN: "High morning, crash after lunch, recovery at 3"
DEFAULT_MEETING_DAYS: ["Tuesday", "Thursday"]
DEFAULT_DEEP_WORK_DAYS: ["Monday", "Wednesday", "Friday"]
```

Then use:
```bash
"Generate today's roadmap using my defaults"
```

## 🎯 Success Patterns

### What Working Plans Look Like
- THE ONE THING is crystal clear and achievable
- Tier 1 totals 4-5 hours (not 8!)
- Energy mapping matches your patterns
- Kill list includes real temptations
- Success metrics are measurable
- Plan generated in <60 seconds
- You feel confident, not overwhelmed

### Red Flags to Avoid
- Tier 1 with 5+ items (too many)
- No buffers between tasks (unrealistic)
- Complex work in low energy slots (recipe for failure)
- Vague success criteria (unclear done state)
- No kill list (everything is not a priority)
- Perfect day planning (no room for reality)
