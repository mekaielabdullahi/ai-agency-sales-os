---

## 🚫 KILL LIST - Do NOT Do Today
Things to actively avoid to maintain focus:

- ❌ Building complex new features or tools (Sunday is for monitoring and planning, not building)
- ❌ Over-analyzing campaign data before sufficient sample size
- ❌ Making too many changes at once (can't isolate what works)
- ❌ Starting new projects unrelated to campaign optimization
- ❌ Perfectionism on dashboard design (functional > beautiful)

---

## 🎯 Execution Strategy

### Critical Path
```
1. Pull campaign data (WHAT HAPPENED) → 2. Build tracking dashboard (MONITOR) → 3. Identify optimization opportunities (INSIGHTS) → 4. Deploy adjustments (IMPROVE)
```

### Key Principles for Today
1. **Data-Driven**: Let actual performance guide decisions, not assumptions
2. **Iteration**: Small improvements compound - don't need perfect optimization today
3. **Protection**: Sunday is lighter work - respect energy boundaries for week ahead

### Risk Mitigation
- **Potential Blocker**: Insufficient data to make decisions (campaign too new)
  - **Mitigation**: Focus on setup and tracking infrastructure, plan optimizations for Monday
- **Potential Blocker**: Campaign performing poorly and needs major changes
  - **Mitigation**: Give it 48-72 hours before major pivots, make small adjustments today

## 💭 Strategic Notes

**Campaign Optimization Strategy**: Focus on understanding what the first 12-24 hours of data reveals. Key questions: Which messages are resonating? Is targeting accurate (right audience responding)? What's the quality of leads generated (if any)? Use this initial data to make 2-3 small, testable adjustments. Track impact over next 48 hours.

**Weekly Planning Context**: Use today to set up next week's priorities based on campaign insights. If campaign performing well, plan to scale. If underperforming, plan iteration strategy. The goal is to enter Monday with clear direction.

**Energy Management**: Sunday is recovery and preparation day. Keep work focused and time-boxed. Protect evening for personal time and rest to ensure high energy Monday morning.

## 🎬 First Action
**Start with**: Open campaign analytics platform, export performance data for past 24 hours, review key metrics: impressions, clicks, CTR, responses, cost per interaction
