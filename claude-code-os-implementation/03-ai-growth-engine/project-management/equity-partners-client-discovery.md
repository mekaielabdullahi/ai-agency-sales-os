# Equity Partners Client Discovery Workflow

## Overview

**Meeting Date:** November 28, 2025
**Attendees:** Mekaiel, Chris, Trent, Matthew
**Outcome:** Good meeting - identified client list and discovery approach

---

## The Simple Discovery Approach

**Core Insight:** We don't need fancy processes. We just need to:
1. Sit in a room with clients for ~2 hours
2. Ask questions about their problems
3. Record everything via Fathom
4. Let the Fathom OS integration extract the key data

**That's it.**

---

## Discovery Workflow

### Step 1: Schedule Client Sessions
- **Duration:** 2 hours per client
- **Format:** In-person or video call (with Fathom recording)
- **Attendees:** Relevant equity partner(s) + client

### Step 2: Run Discovery Questions
**The Only Agenda:**
- What's frustrating you about your business?
- What's inefficient or time-consuming?
- What broke recently?
- What's costing you money/time/energy?
- What do you wish was automated?
- What would 10x your productivity?
- Why haven't you solved this yet?
- Why now?

### Step 3: Record via Fathom
- Every session recorded automatically
- No manual note-taking required
- Focus on listening and asking follow-ups

### Step 4: Automated Data Extraction
**Fathom OS Integration Automatically:**
- Processes transcript
- Extracts key problems mentioned
- Identifies data points
- Generates meeting summary
- Creates action items
- Stores in client folder in OS

### Step 5: Review and Identify Opportunities
- Review Fathom-generated summary
- Identify automation opportunities
- Scope potential projects
- Prioritize by:
  - Revenue potential
  - Client urgency
  - Technical complexity
  - Strategic fit

### Step 6: Prototype and Close
- Build quick prototype for highest priority
- Demo to client
- Get buy-in
- Scope and price
- Close deal
