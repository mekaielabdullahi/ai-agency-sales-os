**Status:** INFERRED from process description

### 6. 90% Can't Do

## ❌ WITHOUT CLEAR EVIDENCE

### 1. Customer Contact Distribution
**Process Map Claim:** "60% cell, 30% office, 10% digital"

## 📋 RECOMMENDED CORRECTIONS

1. **Change "90% of calls"** to "50% of calls" based on transcript
2. **Remove or mark as estimated** the customer contact percentages
3. **Add "estimated" to dollar figures** not directly from transcripts
4. **Clarify 5AM start** as "Early morning routine" without specific time
5. **Note which elements are inferred** vs directly quoted

## 🎯 OVERALL ASSESSMENT

The process map is **fundamentally accurate** with strong evidence for core claims:
- ✅ Kelsey bottleneck verified
- ✅ Communication chaos verified
- ✅ Inventory problems verified
- ✅ Training challenges verified
- ✅ Manual processes verified

However, some specific numbers and percentages appear to be:
- Reasonable estimates rather than citations
- Slightly exaggerated (90% vs 50% for Joe)
- Dollar impacts calculated but not cited

**Recommendation:** Add footnotes distinguishing between:
1. Direct quotes from transcripts
2. Inferences from context
3. Calculated estimates

This maintains credibility while acknowledging where interpretation was applied to create a coherent narrative from conversational transcripts.
