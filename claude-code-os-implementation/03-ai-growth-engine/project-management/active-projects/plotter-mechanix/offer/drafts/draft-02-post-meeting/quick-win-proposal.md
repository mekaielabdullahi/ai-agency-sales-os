# PlotterOps Quick Win Sprint
## Proposal for Plotter Mechanix
### Updated: Post December 17, 2025 Discovery Meeting & Internal Team Huddle

**Prepared for:** Kelsey Andrade (Owner/Lead Technician) & Alyssa (Office Admin)
**Prepared by:** Arise Group AI (Trent Christopher, Matthew Kerns, Mekaiel Abdullahi)
**Date:** December 2025

---

## Executive Summary

We're implementing a **Communication Control System** that replaces your current Vonage phone system with Quo, integrates directly with Jobber, and ensures nothing falls through the cracks—freeing Chris from being the bottleneck so he can focus on growth opportunities like the Lucid Motors contract.

**Investment:** $5,000 (one-time, fixed price)
**Timeline:** 30 days
**Guarantee:** If you don't have more clarity and at least one live change by day 30, we keep working until you do—at no additional cost.

### Our Internal Commitment

We discussed after our meeting: we're targeting **2-week delivery**, not 4 weeks. We want to prove we're different from Malik by delivering faster than promised, not slower.

---

## We Heard You

From our December 17th conversation, here's what you told us:

**Kelsey:**
> "It's hard for me to relay. I get so overwhelmed sometimes. Just getting the words out of my mouth is difficult."

> "I'm literally in the burnout phase... I can't continue on this path I'm at."

> "If I could literally have a camera on me and go out all day... and then just let it record me while I go in there."

**Alyssa:**
> "If I know what you're doing, I can then put it into the system."

> "I pay him $10,000. And then I'm nowhere at the end of it. And then Kelsey's still complaining and actually worse than when you started."

**Joe:**
> "I think the most important thing would probably be just the work efficiency in some areas."

We get it. You've been burned. You need something real. That's exactly what we're delivering.

---

## The Problem We're Solving

Right now, your communication is scattered and Kelsey is the bottleneck:

| Current State (Your Words) | The Cost |
|---------------|----------|
| "Everybody calls my cell phone" - Kelsey handles all field calls personally | Can't pursue Lucid Motors (200 cuts/day) |
| "People open the messages and don't do anything about it and then don't mark it as unread" | Lost jobs, frustrated customers |
| Vonage "sucks" - doesn't integrate with Jobber | Manual data entry, duplicate work |
| Alyssa has "a lot of stickiness" - takes notes on sticky notes | Transcription errors, delays |
| "If I don't see it over here, then I don't know they sent a message" | Things slip through |
| Kelsey conference calls Alyssa after every job | 4-6 interruptions per day |
| Malik took $10K+ and delivered "word salad" | Trust damaged, time wasted |

**Your estimate:** This costs ~$20,000/year in lost time, mistakes, and missed opportunities—plus blocking strategic growth like Lucid Motors, the rental program, and the ink line.

---

## The Solution: Quo Phone System + Jobber Integration

We're replacing Vonage with Quo—a modern business phone system that integrates directly with Jobber and uses AI to automate your communication workflow.

From our conversation, you said:
> "I'm totally fine switching over to Quo or whatever and integrating that conversation thing and recording my conversations like that and getting a list of things. Like, I think that is really cool."

### Why Quo?

| Feature | What It Does | Why It Matters (Your Words) |
|---------|--------------|----------------|
| **One Business Number** | Port your 602 number from Vonage | "I just had my phone number there... all my documentation has my main number on it" |
| **Smart Call Routing** | "Printing goes to Joe, admin goes to her, accounting goes to her" | Kelsey doesn't have to answer everything |
| **AI Call Summaries** | Every call transcribed and summarized | "Something that records my conversations I have on the phone... it kind of dictates my conversation" |
| **Auto-sync to Jobber** | Calls and texts automatically appear on client records | "I'm trying to drive people to text the Jobber, but then they text to the main number and nobody's paying attention" |
| **Unknown Caller → New Lead** | Unrecognized numbers auto-create contacts | No more business cards sitting in pockets |

**Cost:** ~$69/month total for 3 users (billed annually) or ~$99/month (billed monthly)
*This replaces your current Vonage cost—and it actually works.*

### What Kelsey Described Wanting

From the transcript:
> "If I could say, hey, I'm going to send you a quote for a T650, Jimmy, and it could take that information and say, you need to make a quote for a 650, and I could trust it to where I don't have to say it and then text myself a reminder."

**Phase 1 (This Sprint):** Quo captures and transcribes everything, syncs to Jobber.
**Phase 2+:** AI extracts action items and generates quotes automatically.

## What You're Getting

### Deliverable 1: Quo Phone System Implementation

**Primary focus of this engagement:**

| Task | What We Do |
|------|------------|
| **Account Setup** | Create Quo account, configure for Plotter Mechanix |
| **Number Porting** | Port your main business number from Vonage to Quo |
| **Call Routing** | Set up intelligent routing (admin, printing, service) |
| **Jobber Integration** | Enable native Quo-Jobber sync |
| **Team Training** | Train Kelsey, Alyssa, Joe on new system |
| **A2P Registration** | Handle 10DLC registration for SMS (required, 5-30 day lead time) |

**Result:** All business calls and texts flow through one system that automatically logs everything to Jobber.

**Our Risk Mitigation:**
Before we touch your production phone system, we're testing the entire porting process on our own demo environment. We'll set up call forwarding, test the Jobber integration, and verify everything works before making any changes to your business number. No surprises.

---

### Deliverable 2: Four Core SOPs

These are the workflows that run your business daily. We document them, optimize them, and train your team.

| SOP | What It Covers | Why It Matters |
|-----|----------------|----------------|
| **Service Call Execution** | Arrival → documentation → completion → handoff | Trains techs, ensures consistency |
| **Invoice Queue Processing** | How Alyssa processes completed jobs | Eliminates sticky notes, faster billing |
| **Service Call Dispatch** | Real-time routing based on Kelsey's location | Your competitive advantage, documented |
| **End-of-Job Handoff** | Async handoff replacing live calls | Saves 30+ min/day, no more interruptions |

**Bonus: Passive Knowledge Capture**

You told us:
> "If I could literally, like, have a camera on me and go out all day, like, literally just go out, like, okay, today I'm going to be working on this, that, and the other. And then just, you know, in the car before I go in, just be like, all right, I'm here, I'm working on this so-and-so printer, it has a system error code, this and that. And just let it record me while I go in there."

We'll set up exactly that:

```
Kelsey narrates while working → Uploads to shared folder → We process into polished SOP
```

From our first interview with you, we already created a laminator setup SOP from just your audio. This captures your 25+ years of expertise without taking extra time.

**Why this matters:** Trent said in the meeting: "There's maybe 5-10 people in Arizona with this knowledge." That expertise is your #1 asset—let's capture it.

---

### Deliverable 3: Three Smart Automations

These run in the background, watching for problems and keeping everyone informed.

#### Automation 1: Unhandled Message Daily Digest
**Trigger:** 4:00 PM daily
**Output:** Email to Alyssa (and optionally Kelsey)

Scans for messages not marked complete, compiles into summary. Nothing slips through.

#### Automation 2: New Lead Entry Notification
**Trigger:** When a new contact is added or calls from unknown number
**Output:** Instant SMS/Email to Kelsey

Kelsey stays informed about new leads without having to ask.

#### Automation 3: End-of-Day Job Summary
**Trigger:** 5:30 PM daily
**Output:** Email to Alyssa

Compiles all completed jobs with notes, photos, invoice status. Alyssa processes without phone tag.

---

### Stretch Goal: Internal Query Assistant

**Not promised—but we're building it anyway.**

After our meeting, our team discussed what would really blow your minds. The answer: a simple chat interface where Alyssa can ask questions across all your systems.

**Example queries:**
- "What calls came in today that haven't been handled?"
- "Show me all jobs for ABC Printing"
- "What messages are waiting for response?"

**How it works:**
- Connects to Quo (calls/texts) + Jobber (jobs/messages)
- Simple chat interface—no new software to learn
- Queries your business data in plain English

**Why we're doing this:**
If we deliver the basics in 2 weeks and have time left, we want to give you something you didn't expect. This is how we prove we're different.

---

### Deliverable 4: Communication Protocol Guide

You described the current chaos:
> "I'll tell Joe, hey, Joe, do this and that, whatever. He'll be over there doing this, but he doesn't put it on the schedule. So now Alyssa's like, well, I'm like, well, Joe just did this and that. And then she's like, well, how do I know that? He's not even on the schedule."

A one-page rulebook everyone follows:

1. **Everything goes in Jobber** - "Once you start a request or a job or a quote, it's in there"
2. **Messages must be actioned** - Read it? Do something with it
3. **End-of-job = Handoff template** - No more conference calls to hand off
4. **New leads = Jobber entry + notification** - Business card → Jobber within 1 hour
5. **Daily check-in** - 4 PM digest, 5:30 PM summary (matches Kelsey's hot tub morning review)

---

### Deliverable 5: PlotterOps Blueprint

A visual roadmap showing where this fits in the bigger picture—including the path to your "Plotter Mechanics Hub" vision:

- **Phase 1:** Quick Win Sprint (Now) - Communication control
- **Phase 2:** PlotterOps Transformation - Inventory, unified ops, complete SOPs
- **Phase 3:** PlotterOps Guardian - Ongoing maintenance and optimization
- **Future Sprints:** Lucid Motors readiness, rental program automation, ink line e-commerce

## What Changes For You

### For Kelsey:

| Before | After |
|--------|-------|
| Answer every call personally | Calls route to right person automatically |
| Call Alyssa after every job | AI transcribes, auto-logs to Jobber |
| "Did that message get handled?" | Daily digest surfaces anything missed |
| Can't pursue Lucid Motors contract | Foundation in place for growth |

### For Alyssa:

| Before | After |
|--------|-------|
| Sticky notes during Chris's calls | Structured handoff in Jobber queue |
| "What did he say about that job?" | AI summary with all details |
| Wondering if messages are handled | Daily digest confirms nothing missed |
| Manual data entry from calls | Auto-synced from Quo |

---

## Timeline

**What we promise:** 30 days
**What we're targeting:** 2 weeks

| Week | What Happens |
|------|--------------|
| **Week 1** | Kickoff call. Get Jobber access. Start Quo setup and A2P registration. Test on demo environment. Shadow session. |
| **Week 2** | Port number (after testing verified). Deploy automations. Finalize SOPs. Live training session. |
| **Week 3-4** | Buffer for any delays + stretch goal delivery. Refine based on real usage. Deliver Blueprint. |

**Why the buffer?** Number porting can take 5-30 days depending on carrier. We're building in protection so you're not left hanging—but we're targeting week 2 completion for everything in our control.

---

## Investment

**$5,000** for the complete Quick Win Sprint

### Includes:
- Quo phone system setup and Vonage number port
- Jobber integration configuration
- 4 professional SOP documents
- 3 automated workflows (built, deployed, maintained for 30 days)
- Communication protocol guide
- Training for Kelsey, Alyssa, and Joe
- PlotterOps Blueprint (roadmap for future phases)
- 30-day support for questions and adjustments

### Guarantee

> "If by day 30 you don't feel you have substantially more clarity and at least one live change that makes your day easier, we keep working until you do."

**This is the opposite of Malik:**

| What Malik Did | What We're Doing |
|----------------|------------------|
| Weekly rate, no end in sight | Fixed $5,000, 30-day timeline |
| "Word salad" - promises without execution | Specific deliverables you can hold us to |
| Changed website without communication | Test environment first, collaborative |
| Made things worse | Build on what's working (Jobber) |
| No accountability | We keep working for free until you're satisfied |

You told Alyssa's concern directly:
> "I'm not okay with this cycle that I've been through like, I don't know, six times now."

We heard that. That's why every deliverable is concrete, every timeline is fixed, and every outcome is guaranteed.

---

## Why This Works

You're not learning something new—you're getting a better version of what you already have:

1. **Same phone number** - Customers won't notice the change
2. **Same Jobber** - Just better integrated
3. **AI does the work** - Transcription, logging, routing happens automatically
4. **Clear rules** - Everyone knows how information flows
5. **Safety net** - Automations catch what humans miss

**The result:** Kelsey stops being the bottleneck. Communications are captured automatically. The team can operate without everything routing through one person.

---

## What's Next

1. **Sign off on this proposal**
2. **Schedule kickoff call** - 1 hour to get Jobber access and plan Quo implementation
3. **Grant Jobber access** - Trent, Mekaiel, Matthew
4. **We start building** - Quo setup, automations, SOPs

Let's get your communication under control in the next 2 weeks.

## Looking Ahead: The Plotter Mechanics Hub Vision

You shared your bigger vision with us:
> "My heart is, I want to do something financially... I want to start and help kids, dude."

And the lifestyle goal:
> "Sitting at Pine Top drinking on your coffee in the mornings on your balcony... all you have to do is just make phone calls and get paid."

This Quick Win Sprint is the foundation. Once we prove value here, the path forward includes:

- **Inventory System** - "If I don't know that it's taken out of inventory, then that whole process falls apart" (Alyssa)
- **Unified Dashboard** - Jobber + QuickBooks (new Jan 1) + Shopify in one view
- **Knowledge Base** - Kelsey's expertise searchable and trainable ("There's maybe 5-10 people in Arizona" with this knowledge)
- **Automated Pricing** - "We can read a quote in your email, whether it be a PDF attachment... we can take that and update your system automatically"

Eventually, this becomes the "Plotter Mechanics Hub"—a proprietary system that could be productized for other service businesses like yours.

### Bonus: We're Already Preparing for Phase 2

Even during Phase 1, we'll be:
- **Connecting to your email** (with permission) to start identifying pricing data patterns
- **Tracking inventory mentions** in Quo call transcripts
- **Building the foundation** for the full inventory system

This doesn't add to your cost—it's us preparing to hit the ground running when you're ready for Phase 2. And it gives you a head start on understanding what the inventory problem actually looks like in your data.

Matthew told you in the meeting:
> "You're putting the money in to build this system, this ecosystem that we are going to turn into Plotter Mechanics software down the road."

**But first:** Let's nail this Quick Win and rebuild trust.

---

## What You Said at the End

> "I'm not feeling that way with you guys. There's a whole different feel with this scenario. And I just want to say that I'm grateful for that."

We're grateful too. Let's get to work.
