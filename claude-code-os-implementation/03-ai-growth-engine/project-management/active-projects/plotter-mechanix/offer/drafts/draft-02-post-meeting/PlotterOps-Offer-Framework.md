## Key Discoveries from Dec 17 Transcript

### Business Model & Structure
- **Chris Andrade** ("Kelsey") - Owner, sole expert technician with 25+ years experience
- **Alyssa** - Wife/Office Manager, handles back-end bookkeeping, invoicing, message processing
- **Joe Cruz** - New tech (full-time ~2 months), has print shop background, runs social media, handles deliveries and some service calls
- Business started in garage 5 years ago, now has shop location
- Service-first model: "We sell paper, ink, and service - service is where I make most of my money"

### Current Pain Points (Direct Quotes)
- **Communication gap:** "It's hard for me to relay. I get so overwhelmed sometimes. Just getting the words out of my mouth is difficult."
- **No documentation:** "I don't put my notes in. So it's like, I don't know where to look sometimes to find the answer."
- **Burnout:** "I'm literally in the burnout phase... I can't continue on this path I'm at."
- **Trust issues:** "I've been bit by all the people I brought into my little circle... I'm really not able to bring other people into my little circle thing because I got bit."

### Malik Failure Details
- Paid **weekly rate** with no concrete deliverables
- "Word salad" - promises without execution
- Changed website without clear communication
- Total spent: **$10,000+** with nothing to show
- Alyssa: "I pay him $10,000. And then I'm nowhere at the end of it. And then Kelsey's still complaining and actually worse than when you started."
- Created deep skepticism about consultants

### Current Tech Stack
- **Jobber** - Primary CRM, scheduling, invoicing (most valuable current tool)
- **Vonage** - Phone system (problematic, will be replaced)
- **QuickBooks** - Accounting (being replaced Jan 1, 2026 - fresh start due to bad data)
- **Shopify** - E-commerce (disconnected, "sitting out there in La La Land")
- **Capsule** - Old CRM with contact database
- **Dropbox** - File storage (recently consolidated)
- **Outlook** - Email (Alyssa manages inbox, Chris ignores it when overwhelmed)

### Naming Convention System
Sister-in-law developed naming system for products:
- Example: C-HP-730-300K = Compatible, HP brand, 730 type, 300ml, Black
- Critical for new QuickBooks launch Jan 1, 2026

### Revenue Opportunities Identified
1. **Lucid Motors Contract**
   - 200 cuts/day paint protection film
   - Chris already has relationship, did demo cutting
   - Blocked by operational constraints

2. **Rental Program**
   - $35K from ONE customer last year
   - Not actively marketed: "I just stumbled into it"

3. **Private-Label Ink Line**
   - Sells at $125 (Amazon: $50, HP: $175)
   - 5-year customer testimonials ready
   - Could be automated drop-ship through existing vendors

4. **Consulting/Remote Support**
   - Already charging $175/hr for phone walkthroughs
   - Example: Florida customer paid for remote printer help

### Chris's Daily Reality
- Morning routine: Hot tub, review all text messages from last week, check Jobber messages, sometimes inbox
- "Every call I make comes from Vonage" - but Vonage doesn't integrate with anything
- Conference calls Alyssa to hand off information while on service calls
- "If I don't see it over here, then I don't know they sent a message"

### What Chris Wants (His Words)
- "I could say, hey, I'm going to send you a quote for a T650, Jimmy, and it could take that information and say, you need to make a quote for a 650"
- "Something that records my conversations I have on the phone... it kind of dictates my conversation"
- "A list of things... in the morning you get a report on the things that you did yesterday and didn't get to finish"
- "If I could literally have a camera on me and go out all day"

### Alyssa's Needs (Her Words)
- "If I know what you're doing, I can then put it into the system"
- "She has a worse memory than me. She has to write things down right then"
- Uses sticky notes during calls
- "If I knew everything he did" - the communication gap is the #1 issue

### Long-Term Vision Discussed
- **"Plotter Mechanics Hub"** - proprietary software
- Could eventually be sold to other printing service businesses
- Chris: "My heart is, I want to do something financially... I want to help kids"
- Goal: Remote operations from Pine Top cabin

**Team Positioning:** Arise Group AI presented as engineering-as-a-service agency:
- Trent Christopher (industrial automation, 22 years, Honda manufacturing background)
- Matthew Kerns (software engineering, 6 years Amazon SDE, e-commerce entrepreneur)
- Mekaiel Abdullahi (IT/process, Air Force, Pentagon, State Department embassies, MIT)

**Long-Term Vision:** Build toward "Plotter Mechanics Hub" - proprietary platform that could eventually be productized and sold to other businesses.

---

## Stage 1: Quick Win Sprint (CONFIRMED)

**Price:** $5,000
**Timeline:** 30 days (aim to deliver in 2 weeks)
**Status:** Verbal agreement reached Dec 17, 2025

- Creates foundation for "Plotter Mechanics Hub" vision

### Guarantee
> "If by the end of 30 days you don't feel you have substantially more clarity and at least one live change that makes your day easier, we'll keep working with you at no additional cost until you do."

### Ascension Mechanic
If Chris signs the PlotterOps Transformation within 14 days of completing the Quick Win Sprint, the **full $5,000 applies as a credit** toward the $30,000 project.

---

## Stage 2: PlotterOps Transformation

**Price:** $30,000 (or $25,000 with Quick Win credit)
**Timeline:** 16 weeks
**Goal:** A complete, repeatable operating system that removes Chris as the bottleneck.

### Three Core Outcomes

1. **Working Inventory System**
   - Daily use, tied to actual truck stock
   - Eliminates "do we have X?" questions
   - Proper RMA and internal use tracking
   - Visibility into parts usage, reorder points, costs

2. **Unified Ops & Communication Hub**
   - All job info, client communication, and internal coordination in one place
   - Jobber + QuickBooks + Shopify + Dropbox synced
   - "Command center" dashboard for real-time visibility
   - Wife and techs can operate without routing through Chris

3. **Complete SOP & Training Library**
   - Every core workflow documented
   - Knowledge capture from Chris's 20+ years expertise
   - New hires can be trained without Chris's direct involvement
   - Reduces single-point-of-failure risk

### Value Justification

| Lever | Impact |
|-------|--------|
| **Founder time** | Free Chris 15-20 hrs/week to pursue Lucid Motors contract and strategic growth |
| **Error waste** | Missed parts, extra trips, delays = 5-10% of revenue in hidden cost |
| **Risk** | Chris is single point of failure with decades of knowledge - existential risk |
| **Growth unlock** | Enable Lucid contract (200 cuts/day), rental expansion, ink line scaling |

### Guarantee
> "If by week 16 we haven't delivered (1) a working inventory system in daily use, (2) a unified ops/comms hub, and (3) a complete SOP & training library—**and you've done your part**—we'll continue working at no extra fee for up to 6 months total."

---

## Stage 3: PlotterOps Guardian

**Price:** $3,000/month (6-month minimum, then month-to-month)
**Goal:** Keep the machine running. Operations run without Chris thinking about them.

### What's Included

| Category | Details |
|----------|---------|
| **Monthly Ops Review** | KPIs on jobs, callbacks, parts issues, first-time fix rate |
| **System Maintenance** | Adjust automations, workflows as reality changes (up to 8-10 hrs/month) |
| **SOP Updates** | Update documentation when services, machines, or pricing change |
| **Training** | Onboard and train any new techs or office staff on the system |
| **Support** | Priority troubleshooting for system/integration issues |

### What's NOT Included
- Building net-new systems or automations
- Major service line additions
- Big integrations (new tools, portals, ecom)
- Any initiative >10 hours

**Those go into Expansion Sprints (Stage 4).**

---

## Stage 4: Expansion Sprints

**Price:** $10,000 per sprint
**Timeline:** 4-6 weeks each
**Who:** Only for existing Transformation + Guardian clients
**Goal:** Take one major improvement from idea → live, documented, and adopted.

### Identified Opportunities from Dec 17 Discovery

| Sprint | Description | Business Impact |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|
| **Lucid Motors Readiness** | Ops infrastructure for 200 cuts/day film cutting | New revenue stream, strategic contract |
| **Rental Program Automation** | Scale the $35K/customer rental business | Expand proven high-revenue model |
| **Ink Line E-commerce** | Automated drop-ship consumables business | Passive revenue, private-label scaling |
| **Automated Pricing** | AI reads vendor PDFs, updates pricing across systems | Eliminates manual price management |
| **Customer Portal** | Self-service scheduling, history, maintenance reminders | Reduced admin load |

### When It Triggers
When Chris says "Can we also build X?" the response is:

> "Yes, that's exactly what we do in a PlotterOps Expansion Sprint. Guardian maintains what we've built. This is a net-new capability, so we'll scope it as a separate 4-6 week Sprint at $10K."

## Key Differentiators vs. Malik

| Malik | Arise Group AI |
|-------|----------------|
| $10,000+ with no deliverables | $5,000 with guaranteed deliverables |
| Weekly rate, no end in sight | Fixed price, 30-day timeline |
| "Word salad" - vague promises | Specific, tangible outcomes |
| No accountability | Guarantee: keep working until satisfied |
| Solo consultant | 3-person engineering team with diverse backgrounds |
| Changed website without communication | Test environment first, collaborative approach |
| No vision | Clear path to "Plotter Mechanics Hub" |
| Made things worse | Building on what's already working (Jobber) |

---

## Trust-Building Approach (Critical)

Based on Alyssa's concerns and Chris's history with consultants:

1. **Fixed pricing, no surprises** - "I'm not okay with this never ending just keep paying me money"
2. **Concrete deliverables upfront** - Define exactly what they get before starting
3. **Test before production** - "We're going to make sure we test this thoroughly before we have you make any changes"
4. **Over-communicate** - Daily/weekly updates, Slack channel setup
5. **Build on existing tools** - Enhance Jobber, don't add complexity
6. **Deliver early** - Promise 30 days, aim for 2 weeks
7. **Guarantee with teeth** - Continue working for free if deliverables not met

---

## Passive Knowledge Capture Strategy

From transcript - Chris's knowledge is the #1 asset:
- "I could literally have a camera on me and go out all day"
- Already made YouTube videos with hundreds of thousands of views
- "There's maybe 5-10 people in Arizona" with his expertise
- Fixes things with "a paperclip" that would cost $5,000

**Capture Method Discussed:**
1. Insta360 mini cameras on lanyard (low friction)
2. Audio recording while working (like initial mic interview)
3. Upload to shared folder → We process into SOPs
4. Build searchable knowledge base for Joe and future techs

---

## Inventory System Context (Phase 2)

From transcript - this is a major pain point but NOT Phase 1:
- Currently using whiteboard/manual tracking
- Sister-in-law put together RMA processes
- Alyssa: "If I don't know that it's taken out of inventory, then that whole process falls apart"
- Internal use creates tracking problems ("we grab an ink cart off the shelf")
- RMA disputes with vendors are time-consuming
- New QuickBooks launch Jan 1, 2026 will be fresh start

**Why NOT Phase 1:**
- Need communication fixed first to collect accurate data
- QuickBooks migration happening Jan 1 anyway
- "We can't fix it if we don't know what's broken" - need SOPs first

---

## Quote Automation Vision (Future)

Chris's dream scenario from transcript:
> "If I could say, hey, I'm going to send you a quote for a T650, Jimmy, and it could take that information and say, you need to make a quote for a 650, and I could trust it to where I don't have to say it and then text myself a reminder."

**Path to get there:**
1. Phase 1: Quo captures all conversations
2. Phase 1: AI transcribes and identifies action items
3. Phase 2: Extract quote requests → Generate in Jobber
4. Phase 3: Auto-update pricing from vendor PDFs

---

## Pricing Automation Insight

Chris mentioned vendor pricing challenge:
- "Even the FC 9000 will change the price in a month from now"
- Vendors send email updates (sometimes PDFs, sometimes "garbage in email")
- Currently manual update in Shopify, QuickBooks, and Jobber

**AI Solution Discussed:**
> "We can read a quote in your email, whether it be a PDF attachment or just some garbage in your email, as long as it makes some logical sense... we can take that and we can use that to extract the information and we can update your system automatically."

This is Phase 2/3 - but demonstrates the long-term value proposition.

---

## Client Emotional State

Important context for all communications:

**Chris:**
- Burnout phase, overwhelmed
- Passionate about helping people
- Faith-driven ("God's blessing")
- Trust issues from past experiences
- Wants to help kids, not grind forever
- Vision: Remote operations from Pine Top cabin

**Alyssa:**
- Skeptical ("I'm here to listen and learn")
- Protective of Chris ("I hear Kelsey complain all the time")
- Practical concerns about execution
- Wants concrete results, not promises

**Joe:**
- New to team, still learning
- Background in print shop (dad's business)
- Handles social media, deliveries, some service calls
- Sees efficiency opportunities

---

## Meeting Closing Sentiment

Chris: "I'm not feeling that way with you guys. There's a whole different feel with this scenario. And I just want to say that I'm grateful for that."

Alyssa gave thumbs up at end of meeting.

Both expressed feeling this is "God's plan" / "not a coincidence" - take this spiritual/relational aspect seriously in ongoing communications.
