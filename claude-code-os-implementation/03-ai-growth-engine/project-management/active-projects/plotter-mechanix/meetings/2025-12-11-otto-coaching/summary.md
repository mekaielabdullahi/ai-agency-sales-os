## 🎬 Sales Strategy

### Wednesday Call Structure
1. **Open with audit findings**
   - Show work already done (exceeded expectations)
   - Use Kelsey's exact words to validate pain

2. **Stack the pain points**
   - $20K/year bottleneck cost
   - Single point of failure risk
   - Manual inventory chaos
   - No SOPs or training

3. **Close the loop**
   - Show Phase 1 solution
   - Tie directly to $20K savings
   - Position $5K as a "steal"

4. **Plant the vision**
   - Show Phases 2-4 roadmap
   - Talk 7-figure potential
   - But DON'T price beyond Phase 1

5. **Close Phase 1**
   - Get signature
   - Secure payment
   - Set delivery expectations
