Notes
Billing and Financial Stability
The team secured a two-week billing delay and a deposit covering one month, postponing the next billing date to January 20th, which eases cash flow pressure through the holiday season (02:01).

This delay provides crucial breathing room amid a difficult commercial market marked by layoffs, including 113 employees at one company and 40 at another (02:49).
The billing adjustment was arranged by Ty, reflecting a flexible vendor relationship that supports short-term financial stability.
The goal is to survive through the holiday lull until commercial work picks up in spring, when more jobs are expected to improve revenue.
The team views this as a key milestone that directly impacts their ability to sustain operations and ramp up marketing efforts.
AI and Technology Development
Progress was made on AI tools, with a chatbot deployed on Caesar’s website performing well, while the voice AI currently rates about 7 out of 10 in effectiveness, leading to a decision to maintain human office managers for now (04:40).

AI features include an autoresponder for positive reviews filtering replies to only 4- and 5-star feedback, ensuring timely customer engagement without overautomating (05:58).
The development team consists of Eric (voice AI lead), Matthew (Amazon developer), and another member working on small AI tools, creating a focused but lean group (07:19).
The team prioritizes customer service and prefers to keep personal touches until AI capabilities justify automation, balancing efficiency with client satisfaction.
Ongoing AI development supports lead generation and operational efficiency, but human interaction remains essential at this stage.
Strategic Partnerships and Team Building
A new consulting group is forming around strong customer service values, led by the speaker along with Trent (robotics engineer), Mikhail (Air Force systems engineer), and Matthew, leveraging diverse expertise to build scalable solutions (07:19).

The group’s origin traces to improving the customer experience for a family business, leading to software development that evolved into a scalable opportunity (09:10).
Their philosophy centers on delivering solutions that show return on investment within 30 days, aligning product value with client expectations.
They are open to building custom tools for client systems in exchange for learning and future collaboration, offering no upfront payment but aiming for mutual growth.
This partnership approach reflects a long-term vision to differentiate via personalized service and tailored technology.
Client Engagement and Coaching Opportunities
There is intent to facilitate a coaching call with Ty and Eric to provide system and operational guidance, with the speaker acting as a trusted intermediary to arrange and recommend this session (12:27).

The speaker emphasizes existing rapport with the client, aiming to leverage trust to introduce coaching without pressure.
Scheduling will be managed via calendar links shared through Slack, ensuring streamlined booking.
This coaching opportunity is positioned as a low-risk value add to help the client improve systems and readiness.
