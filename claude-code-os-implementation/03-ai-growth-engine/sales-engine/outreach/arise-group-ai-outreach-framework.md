# Arise Group AI Outreach Framework
**The 5 Questions Method for Closing Any Lead**

---

## 🎯 Framework Philosophy

**Core Principle**: You don't close leads by pitching solutions. You close leads by uncovering problems, quantifying pain, and letting prospects sell themselves.

**The Arise Advantage**: While competitors pitch features, we diagnose business problems. While they talk about AI tools, we talk about money saved and problems solved.

**Result**: Higher close rates, better-qualified clients, premium pricing, and zero price resistance.

---

## 🧠 The 5 Questions System

Every conversation—email, call, DM, meeting—flows through these 5 questions in order:

### **Q1: What is the biggest problem in your business right now?**
**Purpose**: Problem discovery & qualification
**What you're learning**: Is there a real problem? Do they recognize it? Is it relevant to what we solve?

### **Q2: How much is this problem costing the business per month?**
**Purpose**: Financial quantification & pricing anchor
**What you're learning**: What's the budget ceiling? How urgent is this? Do they understand the real cost?

### **Q3: How long have you had this problem for?**
**Purpose**: Timeline & urgency assessment
**What you're learning**: Is this chronic pain or new? Have they tried to solve it? Why haven't they fixed it yet?

### **Q4: If you do nothing, what does the next 6 to 12 months look like?**
**Purpose**: Consequence amplification & urgency creation
**What you're learning**: Do they understand the stakes? Is inaction more expensive than action?

### **Q5: If I had a magic wand and could build the perfect solution to fix this problem, what would that look like?**
**Purpose**: Solution design & proposal blueprint
**What you're learning**: What do THEY want (not what we want to sell)? What does success look like to them?

## 📋 How to Use the Framework

### **RULE #1: Questions Flow in Order**
Never skip ahead. Each question builds on the previous one.
- Q1 without Q2 = no pricing context
- Q2 without Q3 = no urgency
- Q4 without Q5 = fear without hope
- Q5 without Q1-Q4 = solution without problem

### **RULE #2: Listen More Than You Talk**
Your job in questions 1-5 is to EXTRACT information, not provide it.
- Ask the question
- Shut up
- Let them talk
- Ask clarifying questions
- Repeat back what you heard
- Move to next question

### **RULE #3: Their Answers ARE Your Proposal**
By the time you reach Q5, you should know:
- The problem (Q1)
- What they'll pay (Q2)
- How urgent it is (Q3)
- Why they must act now (Q4)
- Exactly what to build/propose (Q5)

**You're not pitching—you're prescribing based on their diagnosis.**

## 🎯 Channel-Specific Deployment

### **📧 EMAIL OUTREACH**

**Email 1: Q1 - Problem Discovery**
```
Subject: Quick question about [their business]

Hey [Name],

[One sentence about why you're reaching out—saw their company, mutual connection, noticed their LinkedIn post, etc.]

Before I share what we do, I'm genuinely curious:

What's the biggest problem in your business right now?

I ask because most [their industry/role] are dealing with [common pain point], but I don't want to assume that's your situation.

What's top of mind for you?

Best,
[Your Name]
Arise Group
```

**Email 2: Q2 & Q3 - Cost & Timeline** (Only send if they reply to Email 1)
```
Subject: Re: [their stated problem]

Got it—[restate their problem in their words] makes sense.

Two quick follow-ups so I can understand the scope:

1. How much is this costing you per month? (Ballpark is fine—could be lost revenue, wasted time, team hours, missed deals, etc.)

2. How long has this been an issue?

Helps me figure out if this is urgent-urgent or more of a "solve eventually" thing.

[Your Name]
```

**Email 3: Q4 & Q5 - Consequence & Solution** (Only send if they reply to Email 2)
```
Subject: The 6-month question

[Name],

Last two questions before I share what might help:

1. If you do nothing about [their problem], what does the next 6-12 months look like for you?

2. If I had a magic wand and could build the perfect solution to fix this—what would that look like?

These answers tell me whether what we've built is actually a fit, or if we should stay in touch down the road.

Let me know—happy to show you what's worked for others in [similar situation].

[Your Name]
```

**Email 4: The Proposal** (Only send after Q1-Q5 answered)
```
Subject: Solution for [their problem]

[Name],

Based on your answers, here's what I'd propose:

**The Problem**: [Restate Q1 in their words]
**The Cost**: [Reference Q2—"You mentioned this is costing ~$X/month"]
**The Consequence**: [Reference Q4—"And if nothing changes, [their stated consequence]"]

**The Solution**: [Build this based on their Q5 magic wand answer]

[Describe solution that matches their vision, NOT a generic pitch]

**Investment**: $[Price anchored to Q2 cost—typically 30-50% of monthly problem cost]

**Timeline**: [Reference Q3 urgency] We can have this live in [timeframe].

**Next Step**: 15-minute call to walk through exactly how this would work for your business?

### **📞 PHONE/VIDEO CALL SCRIPT**

**Opening:**
```
"Hey [Name], thanks for taking the time.

Before I dive into what we do, I always like to start with one question:

What's the biggest problem in your business right now?"

[PAUSE. LET THEM TALK. DO NOT INTERRUPT.]
```

**Natural Flow:**
```
After Q1 response:
"That makes sense. [Validate their answer].

Quick question—how much is that costing you per month? Ballpark is fine."

[Listen]

"Got it. And how long has this been going on?"

[Listen]

"Okay, so [X months/years]. Here's the thing I'm curious about:

If you do nothing about this, what does the next 6 to 12 months look like?"

[Listen—this is where they sell themselves on urgency]

"Alright, last question and then I'll tell you if I think we can help:

If I had a magic wand and could wave it and build the PERFECT solution to fix this problem—what would that look like?"

[Listen—this is your proposal blueprint]
```

**Transition to Pitch:**
```
"Okay, so based on what you just told me:

You're dealing with [Q1 problem]
It's costing you about [Q2 cost] per month
You've had this for [Q3 timeline]
And if nothing changes, [Q4 consequence]
What you really want is [Q5 magic wand solution]

Good news—we've built exactly that for [similar client].

Here's how it works..."

[NOW you pitch, using their language and their desired outcome]
```

**Pricing:**
```
"So the investment for this is [Price—30-50% of Q2 monthly cost].

Given that you said this problem is costing you [Q2 amount] per month,
this pays for itself in [calculate ROI timeframe].

And more importantly, it gets you [Q5 outcome they described].

Make sense?"
```

**Close:**
```
"Great. Next step is [onboarding process].

We can have this live by [date]. Sound good?"

[Pause for objections]

If they say yes: "Perfect. I'll send over the agreement today."

If they hesitate: "What's holding you back?" [Return to Q4 consequence]
```

### **💬 LINKEDIN DM SEQUENCE**

**Message 1: Q1**
```
Hey [Name],

Saw [reason you're reaching out]. Quick question:

What's the biggest problem you're dealing with in [their business area] right now?

Asking because we work with a lot of [their industry] and I'm curious if you're seeing the same challenges.
```

**Message 2: Q2 & Q3** (if they respond)
```
[Restate their problem]—yeah, that's what most folks tell us.

Two quick things I'm curious about:

1. What's that costing you per month? (ballpark)
2. How long has it been an issue?

Just trying to gauge if this is something urgent or more of a back-burner thing.
```

**Message 3: Q4 & Q5** (if they respond)
```
Got it. Last two questions:

1. If you do nothing, what does the next 6-12 months look like?
2. Magic wand scenario: if you could build the perfect fix for this, what would it look like?

Based on your answers, I'll know if what we've built can help or not.
```

**Message 4: Transition to Call**
```
Based on what you described, I think we might have something that could help.

We built [solution based on their Q5] for [similar company] and they went from [before state] to [after state] in [timeframe].

Worth a 15-min call to see if it's a fit?

## 🚫 Common Mistakes & How to Avoid Them

### **MISTAKE #1: Pitching Too Early**
**What it looks like**: Asking Q1, then immediately pitching your solution
**Why it fails**: You don't know enough yet. No cost context, no urgency, no magic wand vision
**Fix**: Discipline. Do NOT pitch until you have answers to all 5 questions

### **MISTAKE #2: Not Quantifying Cost (Q2)**
**What it looks like**: They say "it's a big problem" but you don't get a dollar amount
**Why it fails**: You can't price your solution. You can't calculate ROI. You can't create urgency
**Fix**: Push for a number. "Ballpark is fine—is it costing $1K/month? $10K? $50K?"

### **MISTAKE #3: Skipping Q4 (Consequence)**
**What it looks like**: Going from Q3 straight to Q5
**Why it fails**: No emotional urgency. They don't feel the pain of inaction
**Fix**: Always ask Q4. It's the difference between "nice to have" and "must have now"

### **MISTAKE #4: Not Using Their Language in Q5**
**What it looks like**: They describe their magic wand solution, then you pitch something different
**Why it fails**: You're selling what YOU want, not what THEY want
**Fix**: Your proposal should use their exact words from Q5. Copy/paste their language

### **MISTAKE #5: Asking All 5 Questions in One Message**
**What it looks like**: Email with all 5 questions in bullet points
**Why it fails**: Overwhelming. Feels like a survey. Low response rate
**Fix**: One or two questions per touchpoint. Build the conversation over time

## 📊 Data Collection & CRM Tracking

For EVERY lead conversation, track these fields in your CRM:

| Field | Question | Purpose |
|-------|----------|---------|
| **Problem** | Q1 | Qualification & pain point database |
| **Monthly Cost** | Q2 | Pricing ceiling & ROI calculation |
| **Timeline** | Q3 | Urgency score |
| **Consequence** | Q4 | Objection handling & urgency creation |
| **Magic Wand** | Q5 | Proposal template & product roadmap |
| **Industry** | Metadata | Pattern recognition |
| **Company Size** | Metadata | Segmentation |
| **Close Status** | Metadata | Win rate by problem type |

**Why This Matters**:
- After 50 conversations, you'll know the top 5 problems in each industry
- After 100 conversations, you'll know exactly how to price for each problem type
- After 200 conversations, you'll have a library of "magic wand" solutions to reuse

**This data becomes your competitive advantage.**

## 🎓 Training Exercises

### **Exercise 1: Role Play - Full Sequence**
**Setup**: One person is the prospect (given a problem scenario). One person is the Arise rep.
**Goal**: Get through all 5 questions naturally in a 10-minute conversation
**Debrief**: Did the rep listen? Did they pitch too early? Did they use the prospect's language?

### **Exercise 2: Email Sequencing**
**Setup**: Write a 4-email sequence for a hypothetical prospect
**Goal**: Each email should advance through questions 1-5
**Debrief**: Is each email short? Does it ask only 1-2 questions? Would you respond to this?

### **Exercise 3: Objection Handling with Q4**
**Setup**: Prospect says "I need to think about it"
**Goal**: Use Q4 (consequence) to create urgency without being pushy
**Example Response**: "Totally fair. Just to clarify—you mentioned that if nothing changes, [their Q4 consequence]. How much longer can you afford to wait?"

### **Exercise 4: Pricing from Q2**
**Setup**: Given a Q2 answer ("This is costing us about $20K/month"), calculate your price
**Goal**: Price at 30-50% of monthly problem cost
**Answer**: $6K-$10K/month is the range
**Rationale**: If they're losing $20K/month and you charge $8K/month, they net $12K/month savings = easy ROI

## 📞 Real Example Walkthrough

**Scenario**: Inbound lead from LinkedIn - Marketing Director at B2B SaaS company

**Q1: "What's the biggest problem in your business right now?"**
**Prospect**: "Our sales team is drowning in unqualified leads. We're generating volume but conversion rates are terrible."

**Q2: "How much is this costing you per month?"**
**Prospect**: "Hard to say exactly, but we're spending about $30K/month on lead gen, and our sales team wastes probably 60% of their time on bad fits. That's like 3 full-time salaries... so maybe $45K total wasted per month?"

**Q3: "How long has this been an issue?"**
**Prospect**: "About 8 months. It got worse when we scaled our ad spend."

**Q4: "If you do nothing, what does the next 6-12 months look like?"**
**Prospect**: "Honestly? We'll probably have to hire more SDRs to sift through the garbage, which means more overhead. Or we cut ad spend and miss our growth targets. Lose-lose."

**Q5: "Magic wand—what's the perfect solution?"**
**Prospect**: "I wish we had an AI system that could pre-qualify leads before they ever hit the sales team. Like, answer their basic questions, figure out if they're a fit, book qualified meetings only. That would be a game-changer."

**Now You Pitch**:
```
"Okay, so based on what you just told me:

You're spending $45K/month on unqualified leads and wasted sales time.
This has been going on for 8 months.
If nothing changes, you're looking at hiring more people or missing targets.
What you really want is an AI system that pre-qualifies leads and only books qualified meetings.

Good news—we built exactly that for [similar SaaS company].

Here's how it works:
[Describe AI phone agent + qualification system using their language]

The investment is $15K/month.

Given that you're currently wasting $45K/month, this nets you $30K in savings—plus your sales team only talks to qualified prospects.

And we can have this live in 2 weeks.

Make sense?"
```

**Why This Works**:
- Used their exact problem (Q1)
- Anchored price to their cost (Q2: $45K → charge $15K)
- Referenced their timeline (Q3: 8 months of pain)
- Amplified urgency (Q4: hire more people or miss targets)
- Built solution from their vision (Q5: AI pre-qualification)
- **They literally told you what to build and what to charge.**

---

## 💡 Advanced Tactics

### **Tactic 1: The "Pattern Interrupt" Opening**
Instead of "What's your biggest problem?" try:
- "Most [their role] tell me their biggest problem is [common problem]. Is that you, or is it something else?"
- Creates pattern interrupt + shows you know their world

### **Tactic 2: The "Assumption Close" on Q5**
After they describe their magic wand solution:
- "Got it. So if we could build that for you and have it live in [timeframe], that solves this, right?"
- Gets micro-commitment before you pitch

### **Tactic 3: The "Cost Amplification" on Q3**
When they tell you timeline (e.g., "2 years"):
- "So if this is costing you [Q2 amount] per month, that's [multiply by 24 months] you've lost so far?"
- Makes the pain concrete and large

### **Tactic 4: The "Consequence Ladder" on Q4**
If their Q4 answer is weak:
- "And if that happens, then what?"
- "And if that continues, then what?"
- Keep going until you hit real emotional pain

### **Tactic 5: The "Budget Qualifier" Before Q5**
Before asking Q5, insert:
- "Quick sanity check—if the perfect solution cost [30% of Q2], would that be in budget?"
- Qualifies budget before you invest time in proposal

**They just need you to confirm you can deliver what they described.**
