## SECTION 5: Pain Points & Goals (Critical Section!)

### Top Pain Points

**Pain Point #1:**
KELSEY BOTTLENECK - "If I don't come to work, we make no money. In a couple months we'd be out of business."

Kelsey is the ONLY person who can do 90% of the technical work. Business is completely dependent on him. Cannot delegate, cannot take time off, no backup.

**How much time does this cost you per week?** 40+ hours (entire workload)

**How much revenue is this costing you per month (estimated)?** $12K/week risk if Kelsey is sick/absent

---

**Pain Point #2:**
COMMUNICATION CHAOS - "I do everything. I load all this crap into my car, drive all over town, fix everybody's printers while my phone is blowing up."

4-5 different communication channels (personal cell, Vonage, Jobber, email, text). Information scattered. Screenshot bombing between Kelsey and Alyssa. 206 unread emails. Messages get lost.

**How much time does this cost you per week?** 5+ hours

**How much revenue is this costing you per month (estimated)?** $10,000/year lost to missed opportunities

---

**Pain Point #3:**
NO INVENTORY VISIBILITY - "I have no fucking clue what I have in stock."

Zero inventory management. Whiteboard with incorrect counts. Can't sell excess equipment on eBay. Wasted trips when parts aren't available. Cash tied up in unused equipment.

**How much time does this cost you per week?** 10+ hours

**How much revenue is this costing you per month (estimated)?** $3K+/week in wasted trips and missed sales

---

### Goals & Success Criteria

**What does success look like for this project?**
Phase 1: Make Jobber the trusted single source of truth for all business operations. Eliminate screenshot bombing and phone tag. All communication auto-captured.

Quote: "One hub where I go - everything communicates with each other so WE can communicate better. Better team operation."

**What specific outcomes are you hoping to achieve? (Check all that apply)**
- [x] Save time on manual tasks
- [ ] Increase lead conversion rate
- [ ] Reduce no-shows
- [x] Improve response times
- [x] Better customer experience
- [x] Scale without adding headcount
- [x] Increase revenue
- [x] Better data visibility/reporting
- [x] Reduce errors
- [x] Other: Clone Kelsey's expertise so Joe can handle more calls

**In 6 months, if this project is wildly successful, what will have changed?**
- Kelsey can trust Jobber as the source of truth
- Joe can handle 50% of service calls independently
- Remote consulting business scaled up
- Inventory visibility unlocked (Phase 2)
- Alyssa saves 1-2 hours/day on manual data entry

Long-term vision: "Move to Pinetop, sit on a porch with earbuds on, FaceTiming people all day doing remote support." - while local service business runs without Kelsey's constant presence.

## SECTION 9: Additional Information

### Special Requirements or Considerations

**Is there anything else we should know about your business, team, or requirements?**

1. **Previous Project Failure:** Paid $7,000 to Malik for API/database integration project that failed. Kelsey is burned by this experience and needs to SEE results, not just hear promises.

2. **Alyssa's Memory:** Kelsey mentioned Alyssa's "memory is not good" - solution must reduce reliance on memory and provide structured data entry.

3. **Joe's Training:** Joe is in training, can handle about 10% of technical calls currently. Goal is to get him to 50%.

4. **Hardware Rental Model (Future):** Kelsey interested in recurring revenue model - $300-450/mo + usage fees for equipment rental with 60% margins. Requires IoT monitoring (Phase 2+).

5. **Remote Consulting Expansion:** Already doing remote support at $175/call. Wants to scale this and eventually work remotely from Pinetop.

**Are there any specific industry regulations or compliance requirements we need to consider?**
A2P 10DLC registration required for SMS messaging (5-30 day lead time)

**Do you have any existing automation or custom code that we should integrate with?**
- Malik's abandoned project (folder with database/Shopify work - need to retrieve from Kelsey)
- Jobber API integration points
- QuickBooks (new system starting Jan 1)
