## Critical Context from Dec 17 Transcript

### Client Emotional State (Must Acknowledge)

**Chris:**
- "I'm literally in the burnout phase"
- "I've been bit by all the people I brought into my little circle"
- "I'm not okay with this never ending just keep paying me money"
- Faith-driven, sees this as "God's plan"
- Vision: Remote ops from Pine Top cabin

**Alyssa:**
- Deeply skeptical: "I'm here to listen and learn... I'm still skeptical"
- Protective: "I hear Kelsey complain all the time... for five years"
- Wants concrete results: "I pay him $10,000. And then I'm nowhere at the end of it"
- Gave thumbs up at end of meeting - good sign

**Joe:**
- New to team (~2 months full-time)
- Print shop background (dad's business)
- Sees efficiency opportunities

### Malik Failure Details (What to Avoid)

| What Malik Did | Our Approach |
|----------------|--------------|
| Weekly rate, no end in sight | Fixed $5,000, 30-day timeline |
| "Word salad" - promises without execution | Concrete deliverables list |
| Changed website without communication | Test environment first |
| Made things worse | Build on what works (Jobber) |
| No accountability | Guarantee + daily updates |
| Wasn't "interacting with what he was doing" | Collaborative, shadow sessions |

### What Client Explicitly Asked For (From Transcript)

1. **Call recording & transcription:**
   > "If I could say, hey, I'm going to send you a quote for a T650, Jimmy, and it could take that information and say, you need to make a quote for a 650"

2. **Morning reports:**
   > "In the morning you get a report on the things that you did yesterday and didn't get to finish, the things you need to do today"

3. **Passive capture:**
   > "If I could literally have a camera on me and go out all day"

4. **Phone routing:**
   > "Printing goes to Joe, admin goes to her, accounting goes to her"

5. **Vonage replacement:**
   > "I'm totally fine switching over to Quo... I'm down to switch my phone system up as soon as you guys are ready"

---

## Risk Mitigation

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| A2P 10DLC delays (5-30 days) | Start registration before kickoff; calls work immediately, SMS may be delayed |
| Vonage number port issues | Get account details day 1; have backup plan for temporary forwarding |
| Jobber API limitations | Research API day 1; have fallback polling approach |
| Chris doesn't adopt new system | Keep training simple; demo AI summaries as "wow factor" |
| Automations break | Simple flows, tested thoroughly, manual fallback documented |
| Malik comparison / trust issues | Over-communicate, deliver early, document everything |
| Jobber not on Core plan | Verify day 1; may need client to upgrade ($49→$129/mo) |

## Key Client Information

### Team Structure (From Transcript)

| Person | Role | Details from Meeting |
|--------|------|---------------------|
| Chris Andrade ("Kelsey") | Owner / Field Tech | 25+ years expertise, "maybe 5-10 people in Arizona" with this knowledge |
| Alyssa | Office Manager / Wife | Handles invoicing, messages, "a lot of stickiness" (sticky notes) |
| Joe Cruz | Tech / Social Media | New (~2 months FT), dad has print shop, handles deliveries + some service calls |
| Sister-in-law | Bookkeeper | Developed naming convention, manages QuickBooks cleanup |

### Current Systems (From Transcript)

| System | Purpose | Details | Integration Plan |
|--------|---------|---------|------------------|
| Vonage | Phone | "Sucks", doesn't integrate, has own app Chris doesn't like | Port number to Quo |
| Jobber | Job management | "Most helpful thing since I started my business" - keep and enhance | Native Quo integration |
| QuickBooks | Accounting | Being replaced Jan 1, 2026 (fresh start, bad data) | Phase 2 |
| Shopify | E-commerce | "Sitting out there in La La Land", not connected | Phase 2 |
| Capsule | Old CRM | Has contact database from early days | Migrate data (Phase 2) |
| Dropbox | File storage | "Recently consolidated" - files everywhere, hard to find | Phase 2 |
| Outlook | Email | Alyssa manages, Chris ignores when overwhelmed | Hook to backend (Phase 2) |

### Naming Convention (Important for Phase 2)

Sister-in-law developed system for products:
- Format: `C-HP-730-300K` = Compatible, HP brand, 730 type, 300ml, Black
- Critical for new QuickBooks launch Jan 1, 2026
- "I couldn't even find my own products in my database" before this

### Business Context (From Transcript)

**Business Model:**
- "We sell paper, ink, and service - service is where I make most of my money"
- Supporting other dealers, not competing: "I'm not a dealer, bro"
- Private-label ink at $125 (Amazon: $50, HP: $175) - "sweet spot"
- Started in garage 5 years ago

**Growth Opportunities Blocked by Bottleneck:**
1. **Lucid Motors** - 200 cuts/day paint protection film, "thousand cuts a month"
2. **Rental Program** - $35K from ONE customer, not actively marketed
3. **Ink Line Automation** - Could be drop-shipped through existing vendors
4. **Remote Consulting** - Already charging $175/hr for phone walkthroughs

**Previous Failures:**
- Malik: $10K+, "word salad", weekly rate, no deliverables
- Other consultants: "I've been through this cycle like six times now"
- "Every piece of technology I've added has added a bigger headache"

**Long-term Vision:**
- "Plotter Mechanics Hub" - proprietary platform
- Could be productized for other service businesses
- Ultimate goal: Remote operations from Pine Top cabin
- Deeper goal: "I want to start and help kids"

---

## Communication Cadence

From the meeting, we committed to setting up a Slack channel:
> "I'll get you set up on your phone. We'll get them set up on a Slack channel."

| Frequency | Format | Purpose |
|-----------|--------|---------|
| Daily (Week 1) | Slack/text update | Progress, blockers, wins |
| End of Week 1 | Video call (30 min) | Review progress, adjust |
| Daily (Week 2) | Slack/text update | Training prep, testing |
| End of Week 2 | Delivery call (1 hr) | Final training, Blueprint delivery |
| Weeks 3-4 | As-needed | Support, refinement |

**Critical:** Over-communication is essential given Malik history. Every update should demonstrate progress.

---

## Phase 2 Transition

After Phase 1 delivery, use this pitch:

> "You're now running all communication through Quo with automatic Jobber logging. Nothing falls through the cracks. But you're still managing inventory manually—and every time Alyssa needs to know if you have a part, she calls Chris.
>
> Phase 2 builds the inventory system so she can answer that herself. Plus, we connect QuickBooks and Shopify so you have one dashboard for everything. This is the foundation for your Plotter Mechanics Hub vision."

**Credit incentive:** $5K from Phase 1 applies to Phase 2 if signed within 14 days of delivery.

---

## Key Reminders

1. **Quo is the primary deliverable** - This is what replaces Vonage and unlocks the automation
2. **A2P 10DLC is critical path** - Must start registration day 1 (5-30 day lead time)
3. **Trust rebuilding is job #1** - Over-deliver, over-communicate, document everything
4. **Passive SOP capture is bonus value** - Demo during shadow session
5. **End-of-Job Handoff is the linchpin** - Single change eliminates 4-6 phone calls/day
6. **Plant the Hub vision** - Every conversation should reference the bigger picture

---

## Action Items (From Dec 17 Meeting)

### Fathom-Captured Action Items:
1. **Email Kelsey/Chris:** $5k/30-day Quick Win proposal w/ deliverables + ROI; then schedule 1-hr kickoff
2. **Grant Jobber access** to Trent/Mekaiel/Matthew; then set Quo test + Jobber integration

### Before Kickoff Call:
- [ ] Send final proposal to Chris for signature
- [ ] Get Jobber login credentials (need ASAP per meeting)
- [ ] Confirm Jobber plan level (need Core or higher)
- [ ] Get Vonage account details for number port
- [ ] Set up Slack channel for team communication
- [ ] Prepare test environment plan (don't touch production)

### Kickoff Call Agenda (1 hour):
1. Confirm Jobber access granted
2. Walk through Quo setup process
3. Discuss A2P 10DLC registration timeline
4. Schedule shadow session with Chris (Trent on-site)
5. Set communication expectations (daily Slack updates)
6. Address any lingering concerns directly
7. Confirm Pine Top travel plans (Chris mentioned end of week)

### Key Quotes to Remember

**Trust:**
> "I'm not okay with this cycle that I've been through like, I don't know, six times now."

**What Success Looks Like:**
> "If I pay you some money and you give me something that I can actually put my hands on and recognize, damn, remember how it used to be? Now it's like... I want to pay your money, dude."

**The Closing Sentiment:**
> "I'm not feeling that way with you guys. There's a whole different feel with this scenario. And I just want to say that I'm grateful for that."

## Passive Knowledge Capture Setup

From transcript - this is a key differentiator:

**Hardware Options Discussed:**
- Insta360 mini cameras on lanyard (low friction)
- Audio recording via phone (simplest)
- Video for YouTube content (later)

**Process:**
1. Chris records while working (audio or video)
2. Uploads to shared Google Drive folder
3. We process into polished SOPs
4. Build searchable knowledge base

**Already Proven:** Created laminator SOP from first interview audio - showed Chris in meeting and he was impressed.

**Chris's YouTube:** Already has videos with "hundreds of thousands of views" on HP printer topics. This knowledge is incredibly valuable.

---

## Demo Assets Created

From the meeting, we showed:
1. **Laminator Setup SOP** - Flow chart created from audio recording
2. **Opportunity Matrix** - Prioritized pain points visualization
3. **AI-Generated Audio** - 8-minute "podcast" about his business
4. **Cartoon Visualization** - Pine Top cabin vision graphic

These demonstrate capability and build trust.
