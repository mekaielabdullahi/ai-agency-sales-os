## The Ladder (Full Picture)

| Stage | Name | Price | Timeline | Purpose |
|-------|------|-------|----------|---------|
| 1 | Quick Win Sprint | $5,000 | 30 days | Get in, prove value, build trust |

**Year One Potential:** $5K + $25K + $36K = **$66,000+** (before Expansion Sprints)

---

## Stage 1: Quick Win Sprint

**Price:** $5,000
**Timeline:** 30 days (aim to deliver in 2 weeks)
**Goal:** Immediate visibility and control, plus a concrete plan forward.

### What's Included

**Weeks 1-2: Discovery & Mapping**
- Map current workflow across Capsule / Jobber / QuickBooks / Shopify / Outlook
- Shadow/ride-along on sample jobs to document the real process
- Baseline metrics: jobs per week, callback rate, stockout frequency, Kelsey's hours in field vs. remote

**Weeks 3-4: Quick Wins + Blueprint**
- **Communication Hub:** One central place where all job info flows (eliminates fragmented calls/texts/emails)
- **4 Core SOPs:** Document the most critical workflows to reduce Kelsey as single point of failure
- **PlotterOps Blueprint:** The full 16-week transformation roadmap—phases, milestones, system architecture, what stays and what gets replaced

### What's NOT Included
- Inventory system build (Stage 2)
- Equipment history tracking (Stage 2)
- New integrations beyond the communication hub
- Training materials beyond the 4 SOPs
- Ongoing maintenance or support

### Value Anchor
Kelsey estimated the current bottleneck costs ~$20,000/year in lost time, mistakes, and missed opportunities. This $5,000 investment directly attacks that problem and sets up the path to eliminate it entirely.

### Guarantee
> "If by the end of 30 days you don't feel you have substantially more clarity and at least one live change that makes your day easier, we'll keep working with you at no additional cost until you do."

### Ascension Mechanic
If Kelsey signs the PlotterOps Transformation within 14 days of completing the Quick Win Sprint, the **full $5,000 applies as a credit** toward the $30,000 project.

---

## Stage 2: PlotterOps Transformation

**Price:** $30,000 (or $25,000 with Quick Win credit)
**Timeline:** 16 weeks
**Goal:** A complete, repeatable operating system that removes Kelsey as the bottleneck.

### Three Core Outcomes

1. **Working Inventory System**
   - Daily use, tied to actual truck stock
   - Eliminates whiteboard tracking and "do we have X?" questions
   - Visibility into parts usage, reorder points, costs

2. **Unified Ops & Communication Hub**
   - All job info, client communication, and internal coordination in one place
   - Replaces fragmented Outlook/text/call workflows
   - Wife and techs can operate without routing through Kelsey

3. **Complete SOP & Training Library**
   - Every core workflow documented
   - New hires can be trained without Kelsey's direct involvement
   - Reduces single-point-of-failure risk

### Value Justification
No fake numbers. Three real levers:

| Lever | Impact |
|-------|--------|
| **Founder time** | If Kelsey frees 15-20 hrs/week from field work into higher-margin consulting, training, or strategic jobs = tens of thousands/year in extra profit |
| **Error waste** | Missed parts, extra trips, delays, communication screwups = 5-10% of revenue in hidden cost. Tight systems claw that back. |
| **Risk** | Kelsey is a single point of failure with 20 years of knowledge in his head. That's existential risk. This de-risks the asset. |

**Pitch:**
> "You're buying a repeatable operating system that should conservatively pay for itself within 12-24 months via fewer mistakes, fewer emergencies, and more time for you to do higher-value work. After that, it's pure upside."

### Guarantee
> "If by week 16 we haven't delivered (1) a working inventory system in daily use, (2) a unified ops/comms hub, and (3) a complete SOP & training library for your core workflows—**and you've done your part**—we'll continue working with you at no extra fee for up to 6 months total until those are in place."

---

## Stage 3: PlotterOps Guardian

**Price:** $3,000/month (6-month minimum, then month-to-month)
**Goal:** Keep the machine running. You never think about ops again.

### What's Included

| Category | Details |
|----------|---------|
| **Monthly Ops Review** | KPIs on jobs, callbacks, parts issues, first-time fix rate, Kelsey's time in field vs. remote |
| **System Maintenance** | Adjust automations, forms, workflows as reality changes (up to 8-10 hrs/month) |
| **SOP Updates** | Update documentation when you add services, new machines, or change pricing |
| **Training** | Onboard and train any new techs or office staff on the system |
| **Support** | Priority troubleshooting for "system broke / integration broke / data looks off" |

### What's NOT Included
- Building net-new systems or automations
- Adding new lines of business / major service changes
- Big integrations (new tools, portals, ecom, remote diagnostics)
- Any initiative estimated >10 hours or touching multiple systems

**Those go into Expansion Sprints (Stage 4).**

### Quarterly Roadmap Session (Included)
- Review current KPIs and pain points
- Maintain a backlog of potential projects
- Pick the top priority
- If it's big enough → scope as an Expansion Sprint

---

## Stage 4: Expansion Sprints

**Price:** $10,000 per sprint
**Timeline:** 4-6 weeks each
**Who:** Only for existing Transformation + Guardian clients
**Goal:** Take one major improvement from idea → live, documented, and adopted.

### Example Projects
- Launch remote diagnostics workflow
- Build a customer portal
- Add a new service line with full SOPs and pricing
- Deeper AI automations around quoting / triage
- E-commerce integration for parts sales

### When It Triggers
When Kelsey says "Can we also build X?" the response is:

> "Yes, that's exactly the kind of thing we do in a PlotterOps Expansion Sprint. Guardian is for maintaining and tuning what we've already built. This is a net-new capability, so we'll scope it as a separate 4-6 week Sprint at $10K. I'll outline the outcome, timeline, and steps, and if you like it, we schedule it next."

---

## Wednesday Call: Positioning Script

### Opening (After Audit Presentation)
> "Kelsey, we've done a deep dive into how Plotter Mechanix operates. We found some things that are costing you real money—and we've already started documenting solutions. Let me show you what we've built and what we're proposing."

### Present the Quick Win Sprint
> "Phase one is what we're calling a Quick Win Sprint. $5,000, 30 days. We'll build you a communication hub so everything stops being fragmented, document your four most critical SOPs so you're not the only one who knows how things work, and deliver a full blueprint for where we go from here."

### Close the Value Loop
> "You told us this bottleneck is costing you around $20,000 a year. This $5,000 investment directly attacks that. And if we do our job right—which we will—you'll see the difference in how your days feel within two weeks."

### Plant the Vision (Light Touch)
> "If you like how this runs, most owners we work with then have us expand into inventory and full ops over a longer engagement. We can map that out together after we ship this first win."

*Note: Don't name the Transformation, don't mention $30K, don't mention the credit mechanic yet. Just plant the seed that there's more. Save the specifics for after you've delivered.*

### Handle the Malik Objection
> "I know you got burned before. Someone took $7,000 and delivered nothing. That's why we're starting with a 30-day sprint with a guarantee: if you don't have more clarity and at least one real change by the end, we keep working until you do. No risk."

### Close
> "So here's what I'm asking: $5,000 to start, 30 days, and we'll prove we're not like the last guy. If we deliver—and we will—we'll talk about the bigger build. Sound fair?"

---

## Summary

| What | Price | When to Mention on Wednesday |
|------|-------|------------------------------|
| Quick Win Sprint | $5,000 | **Sell this—full pitch, guarantee, close** |
| Transformation | $30,000 | Don't name it. Just hint: "expand into inventory and full ops" |
| Guardian | $3,000/mo | Don't mention |
| Expansion Sprints | $10,000 | Don't mention |

**Goal for Wednesday:** Signed contract + payment for Quick Win Sprint. Nothing else.
**Goal for Day 30:** Deliver early, blow expectations, *then* present the full Transformation with credit incentive.
