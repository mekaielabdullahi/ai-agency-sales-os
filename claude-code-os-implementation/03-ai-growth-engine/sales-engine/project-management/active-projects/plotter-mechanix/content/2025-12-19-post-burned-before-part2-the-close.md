Remember that burned client I mentioned?

$7K lost to a developer.
"Word salad" promises.
Trust at zero.

After a 2-hour discovery call, here's what he said:

"I'm not feeling that way with you guys. There's a whole different feel with this scenario. And I just want to say that I'm grateful for that."

"Like, I know it seems weird, but I truly feel that from my soul. I have that kindred spirit feeling with you guys."

WHAT MADE IT DIFFERENT:

We didn't pitch.
We didn't promise the world.
We didn't show a fancy deck.

We showed him his own business mapped out. His words. His pain points. His processes documented in a way he'd never seen.

Then we said: "Here's what we can deliver in 30 days for $5K. If we don't hit it, don't pay for phase 2."

His response: "I like that. Let's do it."

THE LESSON:

Burned clients don't need better salespeople.

They need proof you're not like the last guy.

And the only proof that works?

Listening like you mean it.
Documenting what you heard.
Promising less than you can deliver.

Then actually delivering.
