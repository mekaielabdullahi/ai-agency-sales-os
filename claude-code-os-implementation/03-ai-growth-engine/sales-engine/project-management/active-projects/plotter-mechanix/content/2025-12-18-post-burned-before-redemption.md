"We paid $7,000. Got nothing. Every week it was something else. Never saw results."

That's what we walked into this week.

A client who'd been burned.
Trust at zero.
Ready to give up on outside help.

THE BACKSTORY:

Hired a developer to integrate their systems.
$7K budget.
Months of "status updates."
Zero deliverables.

"He kept finding new problems. Never showed us anything working."

Now they're skeptical of anyone promising solutions.

HOW DO YOU REBUILD TRUST?

You don't pitch.
You don't promise.
You don't show demos.

You listen until they feel heard.

7 hours of discovery.
Every frustration documented.
Their exact words reflected back.

No solutions offered. Just understanding.

THE MOMENT IT SHIFTED:

We showed them a map of their business - pain points, bottlenecks, the whole picture.

Built from their words. Not our assumptions.

"Nobody's ever laid it out like that. That's exactly it."

Trust isn't rebuilt with better promises.
It's rebuilt by proving you see what they see.
