## Tyler's Key Pain Points (Validated)

### 1. Onboarding Gap
> "That's like one of our biggest things that we're actually working on as a company... We are getting ready to really revamp our onboarding process."

### 2. Client Readiness Problem
> "When people hire Concrete CEO, they say 'I want leads.' And in reality, they don't even realize that their business is broke."

### 3. Contractor Engagement Challenge
> "Contractors, for whatever reason, think that the only thing they could be doing is running around solving a fire in the field right now."

### 4. Tool Deployment vs. Adoption
> "We have a little audit process... we take people through a pro forma P&L statement... And it still blows my mind that people don't do it."

### 5. Google Sheets Limitation
> "We have some really cool things that I really hate that they live on Google sheets because to me they're good enough to warrant having like a micro SaaS."

## What Was Pitched

### Primary Offer: AI-Powered Business Audit
- Leverage meeting transcripts to extract business intelligence
- Create opportunity matrix identifying highest-value, lowest-effort improvements
- Document processes and SOPs before automation
- Phased approach with quick wins first

### Secondary Offer: Development Services
- Engineering as a service
- Full-stack development capabilities
- GoHighLevel integrations and extensions
- Potential micro-SaaS development

### Pricing Mentioned
- **Quick Win Sprint:** ~$10,000
- **Larger Projects:** Agile approach, iterative pricing

---

## Tyler's Revealed Opportunities

### 1. Concrete Pricing Tool
Tyler showed a Google Sheet pricing calculator and expressed desire to turn it into an app:
> "There's currently no way for a concrete guy to price a concrete project on site that takes into account all of the different things... access, thickness, demo requirements..."

### 2. Know Your Numbers Program
Concrete CEO already has a P&L audit process that clients don't use:
> "Remus never took advantage of it, right."

**Insight:** The problem isn't lack of tools - it's adoption. Arise Group could help operationalize existing tools.

### 3. Onboarding Process Revamp
Tyler specifically mentioned this is their Q1 focus:
> "We are getting ready to really revamp our onboarding process. So now is the time."

## Post-Call Internal Discussion (Concrete CEO)

The transcript captured Tyler and team discussing the meeting after Arise Group left:

**Positive Signals:**
- "That was quite good"
- "I did find it interesting"
- Found the audit process concept compelling
- Recognized flexibility of the offering

**Concerns Raised:**
- "A little bit more intense than I expected"
- "Four dudes" - perhaps too many people on the call
- Some existing tools (like Boma) might already do parts of what was pitched

## Remus Development Updates

Chris shared critical context about Remus:
- Just won contract for Fiesta Gilbert (giving them runway)
- Mike Kurek has health issues (contingency factor)
- Chris hasn't been paid since October 10
- Remus is "not set up properly" - validates the audit gap

## Strategic Insights

### What Worked
1. **Chris's insider perspective** - Having experienced the onboarding gap firsthand gave credibility
2. **Hormozi alignment** - Tyler and team share the Hormozi playbook philosophy
3. **Live demo of audit output** - Trent showing the opportunity matrix was compelling
4. **Timing** - Concrete CEO is actively revamping onboarding

### What to Improve
1. **Too many people** - Four presenters may have been overwhelming
2. **Clearer pricing** - Tyler asked for ballpark numbers multiple times
3. **More concrete proposal** - Could have come with a specific offer for Concrete CEO

### Partnership Angles to Explore

1. **Audit Service Integration**
   - Arise Group delivers audits during Concrete CEO onboarding gap (Oct 10-29 window Chris mentioned)
   - Revenue share model

2. **Development Partnership**
   - Convert Tyler's Google Sheet pricing tool to app
   - Build integrations for GoHighLevel

3. **Upsell Package**
   - "Systems building package" for contractors who need SOPs
   - Additional $5,000+ offering on top of Concrete CEO's $2,500/month

**After Meeting:** 65%

**Rationale:**
- Tyler expressed genuine interest multiple times
- Perfect timing with onboarding revamp
- Agreed to follow-up call
