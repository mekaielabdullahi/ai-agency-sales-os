Ran an AI business functions mapping on a live prospect call today.

45-minute intro call → Complete operational analysis in 2 hours.

Here's what we mapped:

→ 5 core business functions identified
→ 12 pain points extracted (with direct quotes)
→ 10 AI opportunities scored and prioritized
→ 3-phase implementation roadmap built

The founder's exact words:
"We are getting ready to really revamp our onboarding process. So now is the time."

THE INSIGHT:
Most discovery calls end with vague next steps.

This one ended with:
- A ranked opportunity matrix
- Specific quick wins (~$10K)
- A clear path to $50-100K transformation

The difference? A systematic framework, not just conversation notes.

Building the AI agency one validated system at a time.
