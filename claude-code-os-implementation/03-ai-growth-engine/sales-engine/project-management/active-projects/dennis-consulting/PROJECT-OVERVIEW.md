## Strategic Notes

From Matthew's thinking:
- Don't need extra work that overwhelms delivery capacity
- Better to split with team and deliver quickly
- Focus on getting enough to pay bills, not maximizing every opportunity
- Team of 3 could deliver in ~1 week

---

## Next Steps

- [ ] Wait for Dennis update (few days)
- [ ] Review meeting transcript for more details
- [ ] If deal closes, scope and price properly
- [ ] Determine team split if moving forward
