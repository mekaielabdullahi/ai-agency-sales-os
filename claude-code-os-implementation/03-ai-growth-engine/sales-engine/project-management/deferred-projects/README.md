# Deferred Projects

## What is a "Deferred Project"?

Projects that **might** have value someday, but revenue is **uncertain** and **timing is unclear**. These are parked here to avoid cluttering active or incubated pipelines.

### Criteria for Deferral

✅ **Belongs in deferred-projects/ if:**
- Interesting idea or opportunity, but no clear path to revenue
- Client said "not now, maybe in 3-6+ months"
- Too early stage (concept only, no validation)
- Dependent on external factors beyond your control
- Strategic value uncertain
- Revenue timing: >8 weeks out or unknown

❌ **Does NOT belong here if:**
- Completely dead (client said "no" definitively) → Delete
- Active revenue opportunity within 8 weeks → Move to incubated-projects
- Committed deal → Move to active-projects
- No strategic value at all → Delete, don't hoard

---

## The Deferral Test

**Ask yourself:**
> "Could this generate revenue in the next 6 months, and do I have a way to make it happen?"

- **YES, within 2-8 weeks** → Move to incubated-projects
- **YES, but 3-6+ months out** → Defer here
- **NO, or completely uncertain** → Delete

---

## Why Defer Instead of Delete?

**Defer when:**
- Client relationship is real but timing is wrong
- Market opportunity exists but you're not ready yet
- Strategic value is high but path is unclear
- "Someday" might actually come (with trigger event)

**Delete when:**
- No realistic path to revenue ever
- Wishful thinking with no substance
- Client relationship is cold or non-existent
- You've been deferring for >12 months with no progress

**The Rule:** If it's been deferred for a year with no movement, delete it.

## Deferral Categories

### Category 1: Client Said "Later" (30-40% Future Probability)
- Client is real and interested
- Said "not now, circle back in Q2" (or similar)
- Specific trigger event for revisit (budget approval, project completion, etc.)

**Example:** Client loves the idea but needs to finish current project first

**Management:** Set calendar reminder to check in at specified time

---

### Category 2: Concept with Potential (10-20% Future Probability)
- Good idea but not validated
- No client attached yet
- Could become something if market conditions change
- Strategic learning or R&D value

**Example:** "Construction app to compete with Procore" - interesting but huge undertaking

**Management:** Quarterly review to assess if timing is right to explore

---

### Category 3: Blocked by External Factor (<10% Future Probability)
- Real opportunity but you can't control timing
- Waiting on third party (partnership approval, funding, regulatory change)
- May never happen, but worth monitoring

**Example:** Partnership opportunity contingent on another company's product launch

**Management:** Monitor trigger event, archive if it doesn't happen within 6-12 months

---

### Category 4: Strategic "Maybe Someday" (5-10% Future Probability)
- Long-shot opportunity with asymmetric upside
- Very uncertain but if it hits, could be huge
- Low probability but worth keeping on radar

**Example:** Platform partnership with major industry player (1% chance but 100x value if it happens)

**Management:** Annual review, delete if no progress in 12 months

## Folder Structure for Deferred Projects

```
deferred-projects/
├── README.md                    # This file
├── {project-name}/
│   ├── DEFERRAL-NOTE.md         # Why deferred, trigger for revisit
│   └── original-notes/          # Any discovery or context to preserve
```

**Minimal structure:**
- Just DEFERRAL-NOTE.md to capture context
- No heavy project management (it's deferred, not active)
- Archive original notes if valuable for future reference

---

## DEFERRAL-NOTE.md Template

```markdown
# {Project Name} - Deferral Note

**Deferred Date:** {Date}
**Category:** {Client Said Later / Concept / Blocked / Strategic Maybe}
**Future Probability:** {%}
**Trigger for Revisit:** {Specific event or date}

---

## Why Deferred

{2-3 sentences explaining why this isn't active or incubated right now}

---

## Original Opportunity

**Client/Context:** {Who this is for}
**Problem:** {What problem it would solve}
**Solution:** {What you'd build/deliver}
**Value:** {Why it might matter}

---

## Trigger for Revisit

**Specific Trigger:**
{What needs to happen for this to become viable?}

**Timeline:**
{When to check back: specific date, quarterly, annually}

**Decision Criteria:**
{What would make you move this to incubated or active?}

---

## Notes

{Any additional context worth preserving}

---

## Review History

| Date | Review Notes | Decision |
|------|--------------|----------|
| {Date} | {What changed?} | {Keep deferred / Move to incubated / Delete} |
```

## Current Deferred Projects

| Project | Category | Deferred Since | Trigger to Revisit | Future Probability | Next Review |
|---------|----------|----------------|--------------------|--------------------|-------------|
| [David Equipment Share](./david-equipment-share/) | Client Said Later | Dec 2024 | David re-engages | 30% | March 2025 |
| [Christmas Lights Voice Agent](./christmas-lights-voice-agent/) | Concept | Dec 2024 | Quarterly review | 10% | March 2025 |

**Total Deferred Projects:** 2
**Target:** Keep <5 deferred projects at any time. If you have 10+, you're hoarding.

---

## Management Rules

### Review Cadence

**Quarterly Review (Every 3 Months):**
For each deferred project, ask:
1. **Has the trigger event happened?** → Move to incubated or active
2. **Has the trigger event failed to happen?** → Extend deferral or delete
3. **Is this still worth keeping?** → Keep or delete

**Annual Purge (Once Per Year):**
- Delete anything deferred for >12 months with no progress
- Delete anything with <5% future probability
- Keep only projects with clear trigger events

**Calendar Reminders:**
- Set specific reminders for "client said later" projects
- Check in when trigger date arrives
- Don't rely on memory - use calendar

---

## When to Move Projects

### Move to incubated-projects/ when:
- [x] Trigger event happens (client re-engages, budget approved, etc.)
- [x] Clear path to revenue emerges within 8 weeks
- [x] You're ready to actively pursue it

### Move to active-projects/ when:
- [x] Deal closes while deferred (unexpected but possible)
- [x] Client commits without going through incubation

### Delete when:
- [x] Trigger event fails to happen within expected timeline
- [x] Deferred for >12 months with no movement
- [x] Future probability drops to <5%
- [x] You no longer want to pursue it
- [x] Client relationship is dead

---

## The Deferral Mindset

**Deferral is NOT:**
- A dumping ground for ideas you're avoiding
- Long-term storage for "maybe someday" fantasies
- An excuse to hoard projects indefinitely

**Deferral IS:**
- Intentional parking of uncertain opportunities
- Time-bound holding with clear triggers
- A way to stay focused on active revenue while preserving options
- A forcing function to review and purge regularly

**Remember:** Most deferred projects will never become active. That's OK. The goal is to capture potential without cluttering your active pipeline.

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### ❌ Don't Do This:
- **Deferring everything you're avoiding** - If you don't want to do it, delete it
- **Keeping deferred projects forever** - 12 months max, then delete
- **Forgetting about deferred projects** - Set calendar reminders
- **Hoarding >10 deferred projects** - Purge ruthlessly
- **Moving too quickly to deferred** - Try incubated first if there's a path to close

### ✅ Do This:
- **Set specific trigger events** - "Check back when X happens"
- **Use calendar reminders** - Don't rely on memory
- **Review quarterly** - Keep or delete, don't ignore
- **Delete liberally** - When in doubt, delete it
- **Limit to <5 projects** - If you have 10+, you're hoarding

## Integration with Other Pipelines

**Pipeline Hierarchy:**

1. **active-projects/** - Money committed or imminent (>70% probability)
2. **incubated-projects/** - Real opportunity, 2-8 weeks to close (30-70% probability)
3. **deferred-projects/** - Uncertain timing, >8 weeks or unknown (5-40% probability)
4. **cold-prospects/** - Leads with no engagement yet
5. **archived/** - Completed or permanently shelved

**Flow:**
- Cold prospect → Discovery call → Incubated (if qualified) → Active (if closed)
- Incubated → Deferred (if client says "later")
- Deferred → Incubated (if trigger happens) → Active (if closes)
- Deferred → Deleted (if trigger fails or time expires)

---

## Quarterly Review Process

**Every 3 months, block 30 minutes to review all deferred projects:**

**For each project:**
1. **Read DEFERRAL-NOTE.md** - Remind yourself what this is
2. **Check trigger event** - Did it happen? Is it still possible?
3. **Assess probability** - Higher or lower than when deferred?
4. **Make decision:**
   - **Move to incubated** if trigger happened and path to close exists
   - **Keep deferred** if trigger still possible and worth waiting
   - **Delete** if trigger failed, time expired, or no longer interested
5. **Update DEFERRAL-NOTE.md** with review notes

**Outcome:** Most projects get deleted. A few move to incubated. Very few stay deferred.

---

## Annual Purge Process

**Once per year (e.g., January 1), purge aggressively:**

**Delete if:**
- [x] Deferred for >12 months with no progress
- [x] Future probability <5%
- [x] You forgot what it is or why it's here
- [x] Trigger event failed to happen
- [x] You don't want to pursue it anymore
- [x] Client relationship is dead

**Result:** Should delete 80%+ of deferred projects annually.

**Remember:** Deferral is temporary parking, not permanent storage. Review quarterly, delete annually. Most deferred projects will die—that's normal and healthy.
