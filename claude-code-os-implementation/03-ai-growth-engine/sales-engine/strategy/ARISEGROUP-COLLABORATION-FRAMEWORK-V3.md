| Client Lead | 18% | Chris or Originator |
| Technical Lead | 40% | Matthew/Trent/Mekaiel |
| Technical Support | 20% | Second dev |
| Support Owner | 7% | Technical Lead (included in their 40%) |
| **TOTAL** | **100%** | |

## REVENUE SPLIT DECISION FRAMEWORK

### Your 4 Questions on Revenue Splits (ANSWERED)

---

#### Q1: What exact percentages feel fair for each role?

**RECOMMENDATION:** Use the ranges as-is for now, adjust per project based on scope

**Decision Framework:**

**Simple Projects ($3K-$6K, straightforward implementation):**
- Lower end of ranges (Originator 15%, Client Lead 15%, Technical Lead 30%, etc.)
- Faster delivery, less complexity

**Complex Projects ($7K-$10K, multi-system, custom development):**
- Higher end of ranges (Originator 20%, Client Lead 20%, Technical Lead 40%, etc.)
- More client management, higher technical complexity

**Per-Project Adjustment Process:**
1. Client Lead proposes split based on project complexity
2. Team reviews in Slack within 24 hours
3. Any objections? Discuss and adjust
4. Vote to approve (simple majority)
5. Lock it in before work starts

**Starting Point (Recommend for First 3-5 Projects):**
Use Option A (Standard Project, No Learning Role) with these exact percentages:
- Originator: 15%
- Client Lead: 18%
- Technical Lead: 40% (includes Support Owner)
- Technical Support: 20%
- Support Owner: 7% (usually Technical Lead, so 40% total includes this)

**After 5 projects, review:**
- Are these working?
- Adjust based on actual experience
- Update this framework

---

#### Q2: If someone is Originator AND Client Lead, should that combined percentage cap?

**RECOMMENDATION:** Yes, cap at 35% total for combined roles

**Why:**
- Prevents one person taking >50% when they don't do technical work
- Keeps incentives aligned (everyone wants to collaborate)
- Technical work is hardest, should be rewarded most

**Rule:**
**If Originator = Client Lead (same person):**
- Combined cap: 35% total (not 15% + 18% = 33%)
- Rationale: Role overlap reduces total effort
- Example: Chris brings lead AND runs project → 35% (not 40%)

**If Originator ≠ Client Lead (different people):**
- No cap, each gets their role percentage
- Example: Mekaiel brings lead (15%), Chris runs project (18%) → Total 33% to sales/PM

**Edge Case:**
If Originator + Client Lead + Technical Lead = same person (solo project):
- Cap at 75-80% (leave 20-25% for support roles)
- OR just do it solo and keep 100% (but miss collaboration benefits)

---

#### Q3: Learning/Process role - what percentage? What are specific responsibilities?

**RECOMMENDATION:** 5-7%, with rotating assignment, clear deliverables

**See dedicated section below for full expansion, but quick answer:**

**Percentage:** 5% (simple projects) to 7% (complex projects)

**Responsibilities:**
1. Shadow the project (observe, don't interfere)
2. Document processes used
3. Create reusable templates/checklists
4. Post-project retrospective (what worked, what didn't)
5. Build internal systems/knowledge base
6. Present learnings to team in monthly sync

**Who:** Rotates per project
- Project 1: Matthew learns Chris's sales process
- Project 2: Chris learns Trent's robotics approach
- Project 3: Mekaiel learns Matthew's dev workflow
- Project 4: Trent learns Mekaiel's systems architecture

**When NOT to use:**
- First 2-3 projects (learn the basics first)
- Rush projects (no time for learning)
- Everyone's maxed out on capacity

**When TO use:**
- Someone wants to learn a skill they don't have
- Building internal processes/systems
- Creating case studies for marketing
- Documenting for future team members

---

#### Q4: If Originator and Client Lead are different people, are we comfortable with that split?

**RECOMMENDATION:** Yes, it's actually ideal for learning and cross-training

**Scenarios:**

**Scenario A: Originator ≠ Client Lead (Common, Healthy)**
- Example: Mekaiel brings defense contractor lead (15% Originator)
- Chris runs the project (18% Client Lead)
- Total to sales/PM: 33%
- **This is good because:**
  - Mekaiel focuses on technical work he's good at
  - Chris handles client mgmt he's good at
  - Cross-pollination of networks
  - Everyone learns from each other

**Scenario B: Originator = Client Lead (Also Fine)**
- Example: Chris brings construction lead AND runs project (35% combined cap)
- **This is good because:**
  - Chris knows the client/industry
  - Simplifies communication
  - Faster decision-making

**Rule:**
**Originator has right of first refusal for Client Lead role.**
- If they want it → They get it (capped at 35%)
- If they pass → Offer to most qualified person (usually Chris for sales)

**Example:**
- Trent brings industrial lead from 4.0 Hero network
- Trent: "I want to focus on building, not client management"
- Team: "Chris, can you be Client Lead?"
- Chris: "Yes"
- Split: Trent 15% (Originator) + 40% (Technical Lead) = 55%, Chris 18% (Client Lead)

---

## PAYMENT & CASH FLOW MANAGEMENT

### Your Agreement
- Collaborators paid within 7-10 days of client payment receipt
- Everyone shares cash flow risk equally
- If client 45+ days late, group decides collectively

---

### Payment Process (Step-by-Step)

**Step 1: Client Pays**
- Payment goes to designated "Banker" for that project
- Banker = Usually Client Lead or Originator (decided at project start)
- Goes into their business bank account

**Step 2: Banker Notifies Team**
- Posts in #payments Slack channel within 24 hours
- "Project [Name] - Received $X,XXX on [Date]. Distributing per agreed split."

**Step 3: Banker Distributes (Within 7-10 Days)**
- Sends payments to each collaborator per agreed percentages
- Wire, Venmo, Zelle, or check (whatever's easiest)
- Includes note: "AriseGroup Project [Name] - [Role] - [X%]"

**Step 4: Recipients Invoice Banker**
- Each person sends invoice to Banker for their own records
- Invoice from their LLC/sole prop
- Line item: "AriseGroup Project [Name] - [Role] services - $X,XXX"
- This creates proper paper trail for taxes

**Step 5: Reconciliation**
- Banker updates shared spreadsheet (see templates below)
- Status: "Paid" with date
- Everyone confirms receipt in Slack

---

### Cash Flow Risk Sharing

**Rule: Everyone shares risk equally**

**What this means:**

**If client pays on time (Net 15-30):**
- Banker distributes within 7-10 days
- No issues, standard process

**If client is 15-45 days late:**
- Banker sends reminder to client
- Banker does NOT distribute until payment received
- Nobody gets paid until client pays (shared risk)
- Client Lead follows up aggressively

**If client is 45+ days late:**
- Emergency team call (all 4 partners)
- Discuss options:
  - Send final notice?
  - Collections process?
  - Write off as bad debt?
  - Legal action?
- Vote on next steps (unanimous for legal action)
- If writing off: Everyone takes equal % loss
  - Example: $8K project, client doesn't pay, everyone eats the loss proportionally

**If client only pays partial amount:**
- Example: Agreed $8K, client pays $6K and disputes $2K
- Team decides: Accept $6K and distribute per %? Or fight for full amount?
- If accepted: Everyone gets their % of $6K (not $8K)

**Protection Against Cash Flow Risk:**
- 50% upfront payment (before work starts)
- 50% on delivery (before 30-day support)
- This limits max exposure to 50% of project value

---

### Bad Debt Protocol

**If client completely doesn't pay:**

1. **Client Lead** exhausts all collection attempts
2. **Team meeting** to decide: pursue or write off
3. **If write off:** Document as lesson learned
4. **Nobody blames Client Lead** (we all agreed to take client)
5. **Update process** to prevent similar situation

**Example:**
- $8K project, client disappears after delivery
- Already received 50% upfront ($4K)
- Missing 50% ($4K)
- Team votes to write off the $4K
- Each person loses their % of $4K:
  - Originator (15%): Lost $600
  - Client Lead (18%): Lost $720
  - Technical Lead (40%): Lost $1,600
  - Technical Support (20%): Lost $800
  - Support Owner (7%): Lost $280

**Learnings captured, process improved, move forward.**

## CLIENT RELATIONSHIP OWNERSHIP

### Your 2 Questions (ANSWERED)

---

#### Q5: Who "owns" the client long-term—Originator, Client Lead, or who does most ongoing work?

**RECOMMENDATION:** Originator owns relationship permanently, but Client Lead manages active projects

**Framework:**

**RELATIONSHIP OWNERSHIP (Long-term)**
- **Owner:** Originator (whoever brought the lead)
- **Rights:**
  - First right to work on any future projects from this client
  - Gets Originator % (15-20%) on all future projects from this client
  - Controls whether to share client with team or keep solo
  - Client contact information stays with Originator

**PROJECT MANAGEMENT (Active work)**
- **Owner:** Client Lead (whoever's running current project)
- **Rights:**
  - Primary client contact during active project
  - Decision-making authority
  - Day-to-day communication
  - Delivers project

**Example Timeline:**
1. **Month 1:** Mekaiel brings defense contractor lead (Originator)
2. **Month 1:** Chris runs Project #1 as Client Lead
3. **Month 3:** Project #1 completes
4. **Month 6:** Client wants Project #2
5. **Month 6:** Mekaiel gets first right of refusal (he's Originator)
6. **Month 6:** Mekaiel decides: "Chris, you run Project #2 again" OR "I'll run this one"
7. **Month 6:** Either way, Mekaiel gets Originator % on Project #2

**Rule:**
**Originator role is PERMANENT for that client relationship.**
- Client comes back in Year 2? Originator still gets 15-20%
- Client refers someone? Originator gets credit for referral source
- Originator leaves collaboration? They take their clients (see exit section)

---

#### Q6: If client comes back for more work later, does original Originator still get their cut, or does that reset?

**RECOMMENDATION:** Original Originator ALWAYS gets their cut for that client

**Why:**
- They took the risk to bring the lead
- They built the relationship
- Incentivizes bringing quality long-term clients (not one-off projects)
- Fair compensation for relationship ownership

**Scenarios:**

**Scenario A: Same client, multiple projects over time**
- Project 1 (Month 1): Chris originates, Mekaiel builds → Chris 15% Originator
- Project 2 (Month 6): Same client, new work → Chris STILL gets 15% Originator
- Project 3 (Year 2): Same client, expansion → Chris STILL gets 15% Originator
- **Forever:** Chris gets Originator % from this client

**Scenario B: Client refers new client**
- Client A: Chris originated
- Client A refers Client B to you
- Who's Originator for Client B?
  - **Answer:** Chris gets "Referral Source" credit = 10% (less than Originator)
  - New Client Lead for Client B can be anyone
  - Chris didn't directly originate Client B, but gets referral credit

**Scenario C: Client goes dormant, then returns**
- Project 1 (Month 1): Mekaiel originates
- Client goes quiet for 18 months
- Month 18: Client returns with new project
- **Mekaiel STILL Originator** → Gets 15-20%

**Exception:**
If Originator leaves the collaboration:
- They take their clients with them (see exit section)
- Those clients no longer AriseGroup clients
- If team wants to keep relationship, negotiate buyout of Originator's %

---

## INVOICING & ADMINISTRATION

### Your 3 Questions (ANSWERED)

---

#### Q7: Who invoices the client—always Originator? Client Lead? Does it matter?

**RECOMMENDATION:** Client Lead invoices client (simplest for client)

**Why:**
- Client Lead is primary point of contact
- Client expects invoice from person they talk to
- Cleaner client experience
- Banker = Client Lead (usually)

**Process:**
1. **Client Lead** creates invoice from their LLC
2. Invoice line item: "AriseGroup AI Transformation Services - [Project Name]"
3. Client pays Client Lead
4. Client Lead distributes to team per agreed split
5. Team members invoice Client Lead for their records

**Alternative (If Preferred):**
- **Originator** invoices client
- Especially if Originator = Client Lead
- Same distribution process

**Rule:**
Decide per project who's Banker/Invoicer at kickoff. Usually Client Lead.

---

#### Q8: Do you need shared contract template, or each use their own?

**RECOMMENDATION:** Shared AriseGroup-branded template that anyone can use

**Why:**
- Consistent client experience
- Professional unified brand
- Reduces legal risk (lawyer-reviewed once, used by all)
- Faster proposal process

**What You Need:**

**1. Master Service Agreement (MSA) Template**
- AriseGroup branding
- Blank fields: [CLIENT NAME], [PROJECT SCOPE], [PRICE], [TIMELINE]
- Standard terms: Payment, IP, liability, warranty, termination
- Signature block: [SIGNING PARTNER NAME/LLC]
- Get lawyer review: $1,500-$3,000 (one-time, worth it)

**2. Statement of Work (SOW) Template**
- Specific to each project
- Scope, deliverables, timeline, milestones
- References MSA
- Signed by Client Lead

**Signing Authority:**
- Any of the 4 partners can sign as "AriseGroup Representative"
- But signs under their own LLC name (for legal protection)
- Example signature block:

```
ARISEGROUP REPRESENTATIVE:

_______________________________
Chris [Last Name]
Remus Development LLC
Authorized Representative, AriseGroup
Date: __________


CLIENT:

_______________________________
[Client Name]
[Client Company]
Date: __________
```

**Storage:**
- Signed contracts in shared Google Drive
- Folder: /AriseGroup/Contracts/[Client Name]/
- Everyone has access

---

#### Q9: How do you handle expenses—deducted before split, or absorbed by whoever incurs them?

**RECOMMENDATION:** Deduct legitimate project expenses before split

**Framework:**

**REIMBURSABLE EXPENSES (Deducted Before Split):**
- Software/tools needed specifically for this project
- Subcontractors hired for project
- Travel if client-required
- Hosting/infrastructure costs for client's system

**Process:**
1. Get team approval BEFORE incurring expense
2. Post in Slack: "Project [Name] - Need to buy [Tool] for $XXX. OK?"
3. Team votes within 24 hours
4. If approved, person buys it and saves receipt
5. At distribution time, reimburse from project revenue first, then split remainder

**Example:**
- Project revenue: $8,000
- Expenses: $500 (software license for client's system)
- Net revenue: $7,500
- Split $7,500 per agreed percentages

**NON-REIMBURSABLE EXPENSES (Absorbed Individually):**
- Your own computer, software you'd use anyway
- Your internet, office, general overhead
- Your time learning new skills
- Marketing/business development costs

**These are your own business expenses, not project expenses.**

**Subcontractor Policy:**
If hiring outside help:
- Get team approval BEFORE hiring
- Subcontractor cost deducted before split
- Clear scope and deliverables for subcontractor
- One partner manages subcontractor (usually Technical Lead)

---

## INTERNAL AGENCY BUILDING WORK

### Your 3 Questions (ANSWERED)

---

#### Q10: Is Mekaiel's process/systems building work unpaid collective investment, or compensated somehow?

**RECOMMENDATION:** Compensated via Learning/Process role when tied to specific projects, unpaid when general

**Framework:**

**PAID (Learning/Process Role 5-7%):**
- Building systems/processes specific to a client project
- Example: Documenting this project's workflow to reuse
- Creating templates from this project's deliverables
- Post-project retrospective and knowledge capture
- Paid from that project's revenue

**UNPAID (Collective Investment):**
- General agency building (this framework document, for example)
- Marketing website, AriseGroup branding
- General templates not tied to specific project
- Team meetings, coordination
- These are "sweat equity" - everyone contributes
- Future payoff when you formalize into real company

**Hybrid Approach (RECOMMENDED):**

**Everyone contributes ~2-5 hours/week unpaid to agency building:**
- Mekaiel: Systems, processes, documentation
- Chris: Lead generation, sales process refinement
- Matthew: Tech infrastructure, Notion setup
- Trent: Industry research, prototyping

**These hours are "investment" in future formalization.**

**Track these hours in shared spreadsheet:**
- If you formalize later → Hours convert to equity weight
- If you stay independent → Goodwill and shared ownership of IP

**Example:**
- 3 months of agency building
- Mekaiel contributes 40 hours (systems)
- Chris contributes 30 hours (sales process)
- Matthew contributes 35 hours (tech setup)
- Trent contributes 25 hours (industry research)
- Total: 130 hours collective investment
- If formalizing: These hours inform equity split discussion

---

#### Q11: Who owns the IP for internal systems, templates, and processes you build together?

**RECOMMENDATION:** Shared ownership among the 4, with usage rights defined

**Framework:**

**INTERNAL IP CATEGORIES:**

**Category 1: Client Deliverables**
- Client owns (work-for-hire)
- You retain right to reuse non-client-specific components
- Example: Custom AI agent for Client A → Client A owns; you can reuse the underlying framework

**Category 2: Reusable Tech Assets**
- Code modules, frameworks, templates built for projects
- **Shared ownership** among 4 partners
- Can be used by any partner on any AriseGroup project
- Can't be sold or licensed to third parties without unanimous approval
- Example: CRM integration framework → All 4 can use

**Category 3: Process/Systems IP**
- This collaboration framework, sales processes, templates
- **Shared ownership** among 4 partners
- Free to use within AriseGroup work
- Can't take to competing venture
- Example: Q1-Q5 discovery framework → All 4 can use

**Category 4: Individual Pre-Existing IP**
- Stuff you brought to the collaboration
- You own, you can take if you leave
- Example: Trent's 4.0 Hero methodology → Trent owns

**Usage Rights:**

**While Collaborating:**
- All 4 partners can use shared IP freely
- Can't restrict access or charge each other
- Contribute improvements back to shared pool

**If Formalizing:**
- Shared IP becomes company property (AriseGroup LLC)
- Everyone gets equity based on contribution

**If Dissolving:**
- Everyone keeps usage rights to shared IP
- Can use in non-competing ventures
- Can't claim exclusive ownership
- Can't prevent others from using

**If Someone Leaves:**
- Leaving partner keeps usage rights (can use in their own business)
- Can't sell shared IP to competitors
- Can't prevent remaining partners from continuing to use
- Remaining partners can continue building on shared IP

**Protection:**
Simple IP agreement (1-page document):
```
"We, the undersigned, agree that IP created collaboratively during AriseGroup projects is shared among us. We can each use it, but not exclusively own it, sell it, or prevent others from using it. Created IP includes [list categories]. Signed: [All 4]."
```

Get this signed NOW (this week) to avoid future disputes.

---

#### Q12: If someone leaves collaboration, can they take what was built, or does it stay with group?

**RECOMMENDATION:** Leaver keeps usage rights, but can't sell or exclusively claim

**Exit IP Protocol:**

**What Leaver CAN Take:**
1. **Their clients** (that they originated)
2. **Usage rights** to shared IP (can use in their own business)
3. **Their individual contributions** (what they personally built)
4. **Their pre-existing IP** (what they brought to collaboration)

**What Leaver CANNOT Take:**
1. **Exclusive ownership** of shared IP (others keep using it)
2. **Ability to sell shared IP** to third parties
3. **Ability to prevent** remaining partners from using/improving shared IP
4. **AriseGroup brand** (can't call themselves AriseGroup after leaving)

**Example:**

Mekaiel leaves in Month 6:
- **Takes:** His defense contractor clients, usage rights to all systems built, his systems architecture work
- **Can:** Use Q1-Q5 framework in his solo business, use templates built, reference processes
- **Cannot:** Sell AriseGroup IP, claim exclusive ownership, prevent Chris/Trent/Matthew from using anything, use "AriseGroup" brand

**Remaining Partners (Chris, Trent, Matthew):**
- **Keep:** Usage rights to everything, can continue improving it, can use Mekaiel's contributions
- **Cannot:** Claim Mekaiel didn't contribute, use Mekaiel's personal brand/reputation without permission

**Fair and Clean.**

## RISK & LIABILITY SHARING

### Your 2 Questions (ANSWERED)

---

#### Q13: If project goes sideways, how do you share the downside?

**RECOMMENDATION:** Proportional to revenue share, with Client Lead taking reputational responsibility

**Framework:**

**FINANCIAL RISK (Shared Proportionally):**

**If client doesn't pay:**
- Everyone loses their % of unpaid amount
- Example: $8K project, client pays $0, everyone eats loss per their %

**If project requires more work than scoped:**
- Client Lead calls team meeting
- Options:
  1. **Eat the cost** (everyone works extra for same pay)
  2. **Renegotiate with client** (try to get more $)
  3. **Cut scope** (deliver less, keep original price)
- Team votes on approach
- If eating cost: Everyone contributes proportional to their original %

**If client demands refund:**
- Team meeting to assess validity
- If legitimate quality issue: Refund proportionally (everyone returns their %)
- If client just changed mind: Offer to fix, don't refund
- If legal threat: Decide collectively (unanimous vote for legal action)

---

**REPUTATIONAL RISK (Client Lead Bears Most)**

**Client Lead's responsibility:**
- Ensure delivery quality
- Manage client expectations
- Communicate issues early
- Make final call on client-facing decisions

**But:** Team supports Client Lead
- If Client Lead is drowning, team helps
- Post-mortems are blameless (focus on process, not person)
- Don't throw Client Lead under bus to client

---

**LIABILITY RISK (Individual + Collective)**

**Individual Liability:**
- Each person's LLC provides some protection
- Your own business insurance covers you
- Professional liability insurance recommended ($1M policy ~$500-1,500/year)

**Collective Liability:**
- If client sues "AriseGroup": They'll name all 4 LLCs
- Legal costs split 4 ways (equal, not proportional)
- Settlements split per decision (usually equal)

**Protection:**
- Strong contracts with liability caps
- Insurance (each person carries their own)
- Incorporate (LLC) for personal asset protection
- Don't promise what you can't deliver

---

#### Q14: Is there a threshold where you'd walk away from a project or client collectively?

**RECOMMENDATION:** Yes, define red lines now

**WALK-AWAY THRESHOLDS:**

**BEFORE SIGNING CONTRACT:**

**Automatic No-Go (Anyone can veto):**
- Ethical concerns (illegal, harmful, deceptive)
- Client wants spec work (unpaid proof-of-concept)
- Client has reputation for non-payment (research beforehand)
- Scope is impossible in timeline
- Client is abusive or disrespectful

**Requires Unanimous Yes:**
- Equity deals (taking ownership instead of cash)
- Clients >$25K (higher risk, need everyone's buy-in)
- Clients in unfamiliar industries (learning curve risk)

---

**AFTER PROJECT STARTS:**

**Walk Away If:**
- Client becomes abusive or hostile
- Client stops paying (45+ days past due, no communication)
- Client keeps changing scope without paying (scope creep >25%)
- Legal/ethical issue discovered
- Safety concern (for industrial/physical projects)

**Process:**
1. Client Lead flags issue immediately
2. Emergency team call within 24 hours
3. Attempt resolution with client
4. If unresolvable: Vote to walk away (unanimous)
5. Return unused portion of payment (if any)
6. Terminate contract professionally
7. Document lessons learned

**Example:**
- Client keeps adding features without paying
- Scope has grown 40% beyond original
- Client Lead (Chris) raises alarm
- Team meeting: "Client is taking advantage"
- Vote: Walk away or demand payment for extra scope?
- Unanimous: Demand payment or stop work
- Chris delivers message to client
- Client either pays or project ends

**Protecting Each Other:**
- We don't abandon each other mid-project
- If someone's in trouble, team helps solve it
- Walking away is last resort, but it's an option

- Are we each making reasonable income?
- Is the revenue split feeling fair?

**Collaboration Quality:**
- Are we working well together?
- Any major conflicts or resentment?
- Communication smooth?
- Trust building or eroding?

**Client Satisfaction:**
- Happy clients?
- Referrals happening?
- Quality delivery?

**Strategic Fit:**
- Do our strengths complement?
- Or are we competing/overlapping?
- Are we better together or solo?

**Personal Satisfaction:**
- Is this fun/fulfilling?
- Or stressful/frustrating?
- Want to continue?

**Unanimous Vote Required to Formalize.**
If even one person wants out, respect that. Either continue as 3, or dissolve gracefully.

---

#### Q16: What would success look like after 3-6 months?

**RECOMMENDATION:** Define success metrics now (quantitative + qualitative)

**3-MONTH SUCCESS METRICS:**

**Quantitative (Hard Numbers):**
- [ ] 6-12 projects closed
- [ ] $30K-$70K total revenue
- [ ] $7.5K-$17.5K per person average
- [ ] 2-3 repeat clients or referrals
- [ ] 0 payment disputes among team
- [ ] 0 client lawsuits or major conflicts
- [ ] <10% project failure rate (scope blow-up, refunds, etc.)

**Qualitative (Soft Signals):**
- [ ] Enjoying working together
- [ ] Learning from each other
- [ ] Clear communication, no resentment
- [ ] Excited about next 3 months
- [ ] Clients praising the team approach
- [ ] Feeling like "this could be big"

**If 80%+ of above are ✅ → Success, continue or formalize**

---

**6-MONTH SUCCESS METRICS:**

**Quantitative:**
- [ ] 15-25 projects total
- [ ] $75K-$150K total revenue
- [ ] $18K-$37K per person
- [ ] 30%+ repeat/referral rate
- [ ] 3-5 ongoing retainers ($1.5K-$5K/month each)
- [ ] $5K-$15K Monthly Recurring Revenue
- [ ] Clear pipeline for next 3 months

**Qualitative:**
- [ ] Formalized into AriseGroup LLC (if desired)
- [ ] Clear roles and processes (operating on autopilot)
- [ ] Strong reputation in market
- [ ] Considering first hire (expanding team)
- [ ] Thinking 12+ months ahead

**If 80%+ of above are ✅ → Major success, scale up**

---

#### Q17: If it's not working for someone, what's the exit process?

**RECOMMENDATION:** 30-day notice, finish active projects, clean handoff

**EXIT PROTOCOL:**

**If Someone Wants to Leave:**

**Step 1: Private Conversation (Optional)**
- Talk to one other partner first (if comfortable)
- Get their perspective
- See if issue is resolvable

**Step 2: Team Notification**
- Call team meeting (all 4)
- Be honest: "This isn't working for me because [X]"
- Give **30-day notice** (preferred, not required)

**Step 3: Discussion**
- Team asks: Is there a way to fix it?
- Adjust role splits?
- Change responsibilities?
- Take a break and rejoin later?
- If resolvable: Work it out, continue
- If not: Part gracefully

**Step 4: Transition (If Leaving)**

**Finish Active Projects:**
- Complete work you're committed to
- Or negotiate buyout (team pays you to leave early)
- Don't leave team hanging mid-project

**Client Handoff:**
- Clients you originated: You decide if you take or leave them
- Clients you're Client Lead on: Hand off to someone else (usually Chris)
- Ongoing projects: Brief the team on status

**Financial Cleanup:**
- Distribute any pending payments
- Settle any expenses owed
- Close out any shared accounts

**IP & Access:**
- You keep usage rights to shared IP (as defined in Section 7)
- Remove from Slack, Notion, bank accounts
- Keep your copy of templates/systems

**Communication:**
- Decide together: What to tell clients?
- Usually: "Mekaiel is focusing on his solo venture. Chris will be your point of contact going forward."
- Professional, no drama

**Step 5: Post-Exit**
- Non-compete: Don't poach AriseGroup clients
- Non-solicitation: Don't recruit other partners to leave
- Goodwill: Leave the door open (maybe rejoin later?)
- Referrals: If you get lead that fits AriseGroup, refer it (optional, but classy)

---

**FORCED EXIT (If Someone's Not Performing):**

**Rare, but if someone is:**
- Not delivering quality work
- Missing deadlines consistently
- Damaging client relationships
- Being dishonest

**Process:**
1. **Private conversation** (two partners talk to underperformer)
2. **Performance improvement plan** (30 days to fix issues)
3. **If no improvement:** Team vote (3 of 4 can vote someone out)
4. **Exit:** Same process as voluntary exit, but faster (7-day notice)

**Buyout:**
If applicable (if there's value in company at that point), remaining partners buy out leaving partner's share (negotiated fair value).

---

## THE LEARNING/PROCESS ROLE (EXPANDED)

### The Most Innovative Part of Your Framework

**Why This Role Exists:**
- Traditional agencies don't learn systematically
- Knowledge stays in individual heads
- Every project reinvents the wheel
- New team members take months to onboard
- You want to build compounding IP, not just deliver projects

**The Learning/Process role creates a deliberate system for capturing and scaling knowledge.**

---

### What the Learning/Process Person Does

**DURING PROJECT (Observing):**

**Week 1-2: Shadowing**
- Attend relevant meetings (kickoff, check-ins, client calls)
- Ask questions to understand process
- Take notes on decisions and rationale
- Don't interfere with delivery

**Week 3-4: Documenting**
- Create process maps (flowcharts of how work got done)
- Document tools/techniques used
- Capture gotchas and lessons learned
- Interview team members on their approach

**POST-PROJECT (Synthesizing):**

**Week 5: Knowledge Creation**
- Write up case study (internal)
- Create reusable templates from this project
- Build checklists or SOPs
- Update shared knowledge base

**Week 6: Team Presentation**
- Present learnings in monthly team sync (15-20 min)
- Share "What worked, what didn't"
- Propose process improvements
- Get team feedback

---

### Specific Deliverables

**Choose 2-3 of these per project:**

1. **Process Documentation**
   - Flowchart: How this project went from lead → delivery
   - Decision log: Key decisions and why
   - Timeline breakdown: Actual vs estimated time per phase

2. **Template Creation**
   - Proposal template for this type of project
   - SOW template
   - Technical architecture template
   - Client onboarding checklist

3. **Case Study (Internal)**
   - Client problem (anonymized)
   - Our solution approach
   - Results achieved
   - What we'd do differently next time

4. **Training Materials**
   - How-to guide for future similar projects
   - Video walkthrough of technical approach
   - FAQ based on client questions

5. **Tool/System Recommendations**
   - "We used [Tool X] on this project, here's how it worked"
   - Pros/cons/pricing
   - Recommendation for future projects

6. **Post-Project Retrospective**
   - Facilitate 60-min retrospective with team
   - What went well?
   - What went poorly?
   - What should we change?
   - Document outcomes

---

### Who Should Take This Role When

**Rotation Strategy:**

**Project 1-2: No Learning Role**
- Too early, everyone's learning the basics
- Focus on delivery

**Project 3: Matthew takes Learning Role**
- Shadows Chris's sales process
- Creates sales playbook
- Learns client management

**Project 4: Chris takes Learning Role**
- Shadows Trent's robotics development
- Learns industrial automation basics
- Documents technical approach

**Project 5: Mekaiel takes Learning Role**
- Shadows Matthew's software development
- Creates dev process documentation
- Learns e-commerce tech stack

**Project 6: Trent takes Learning Role**
- Shadows Mekaiel's systems architecture
- Learns defense/government compliance
- Documents prerequisites framework

**Pattern: Everyone rotates, learns from everyone else.**

---

### Compensation Structure

**Option A: Fixed Percentage (Recommended)**
- 5% for simple projects
- 7% for complex projects
- Comes from slight reduction in other roles

**Option B: Fixed Dollar Amount**
- $250-$500 per project
- Regardless of project size
- Easier to budget

**Option C: Hourly**
- Estimate 10-15 hours for Learning role
- Pay $50-75/hour
- Example: 12 hours × $60 = $720 ≈ 7% of $10K project

**Recommendation: Use Option A (Fixed %)**

**Example Revised Split with Learning Role:**

$8,000 Project:
- Originator: 15% = $1,200
- Client Lead: 17% = $1,360
- Technical Lead: 37% = $2,960 (includes Support Owner)
- Technical Support: 18% = $1,440
- Learning/Process: 6% = $480
- Support Owner: 7% = $560 (usually Technical Lead, so included in their 37%)
- **Total: 100% = $8,000**

**The Learning Person Gets $480 for:**
- 10-15 hours of shadowing/documenting
- Plus deliverables (case study, templates, etc.)
- Roughly $32-48/hour equivalent

**Fair compensation for value created (reusable IP).**

---

### When NOT to Use Learning Role

**Skip it if:**
- First 2-3 projects (too early)
- Rush project (no time)
- Very small project (<$5K - not enough $ to split 6 ways)
- Nobody wants to learn this type of work
- Team at capacity (everyone maxed out)

**It's optional, not mandatory.**

---

### Long-Term Value

**After 10 projects with Learning Role:**
- 10 case studies (internal knowledge base)
- 20-30 templates (proposal, SOW, technical, onboarding)
- Process documentation for every type of project
- Training materials for new team members
- Compounding IP that makes you faster/better/smarter

**This is the difference between:**
- **Project 10 taking same time as Project 1** (no learning)
- **Project 10 taking 50% less time than Project 1** (compounded learning)

**This role creates the foundation for scaling.**

When you hire Team Member #5, they can onboard in 1 week (not 3 months) because of this documentation.

**Worth the 5-7%.**

## PROJECT SCENARIOS WITH REVENUE SPLITS

### Let's Make This Concrete

---

### SCENARIO 1: E-commerce Automation ($6,000)

**Client:** Small Shopify store, 50-100 orders/day, manual customer service

**Roles:**
- **Originator:** Matthew (brought from InfinityVault network) - 15%
- **Client Lead:** Chris (ran discovery, created proposal, manages client) - 18%
- **Technical Lead:** Matthew (builds the automation) - 40%
- **Technical Support:** Mekaiel (integrates with their CRM) - 20%
- **Support Owner:** Matthew (same as Technical Lead) - 7% (included in 40%)
- **Learning/Process:** None (early project, skipping)

**Split:**
- Matthew: 15% (Originator) + 40% (Tech Lead + Support) = 55% = $3,300
- Chris: 18% (Client Lead) = $1,080
- Mekaiel: 20% (Tech Support) = $1,200
- Trent: 0% (not needed) = $0
- **Total: 93% = $5,580** (Wait, math is off!)

**CORRECTION - Need to redistribute:**

Actually, Support Owner is included in Technical Lead %, so:
- Matthew: 15% (Originator) + 40% (Tech Lead) = 55%
- Chris: 18% (Client Lead) = 18%
- Mekaiel: 20% (Tech Support) = 20%
- **Total should = 100%** but we have 93%

**REVISED (Proper Math):**
- Matthew: 15% (Originator) + 35% (Tech Lead) = 50% = $3,000
- Chris: 20% (Client Lead) = $1,200
- Mekaiel: 23% (Tech Support) = $1,380
- Support Owner: Built into Matthew's 35% Tech Lead role
- **Total: 93%... still wrong**

**LET ME FIX THE FRAMEWORK:**

The issue is: Support Owner % needs to be explicitly decided.

**CORRECTED FRAMEWORK:**

Support Owner is either:
1. **Same as Technical Lead** (most common) → Their % includes support responsibility
2. **Separate role** (rare) → Gets own % deducted from others

**For this scenario (Support Owner = Technical Lead):**
- Originator: 15%
- Client Lead: 18%
- Technical Lead: 40% (INCLUDES 7% for support responsibility)
- Technical Support: 20%
- **Total: 93%** ← Still doesn't add to 100%

**THE REAL ISSUE:** We need to adjust percentages to total 100%

**SOLUTION - Proportional Adjustment:**

**Without Learning Role, redistribute to hit 100%:**
- Originator: 15%
- Client Lead: 20%
- Technical Lead: 42% (includes support)
- Technical Support: 23%
- **Total: 100%**

**Final Split for $6,000 Project:**
- Matthew: 15% + 42% = 57% = $3,420
- Chris: 20% = $1,200
- Mekaiel: 23% = $1,380
- **Total: $6,000 ✓**

---

### SCENARIO 2: Industrial Robotics ($9,000)

**Client:** Manufacturing plant, want to automate material handling

**Roles:**
- **Originator:** Trent (from 4.0 Hero network) - 15%
- **Client Lead:** Trent (he knows industry best) - CAPPED at 35% combined
- **Technical Lead:** Trent (robotics implementation) - Can't triple-dip
- **Technical Support:** Matthew (software interface) - 20%
- **Systems Architecture:** Mekaiel (designs overall system) - 25%
- **Support Owner:** Trent (built it, supports it) - 7% included
- **Learning/Process:** Chris (learning robotics) - 6%

**Problem:** Trent is Originator + Client Lead + Technical Lead = Way too much

**SOLUTION:** Cap Trent at reasonable total

**Revised:**
- **Originator:** Trent - 15%
- **Client Lead:** Trent - 18% (combined with Originator = 33%, under 35% cap)
- **Technical Lead:** Trent - 30% (reduced because he's wearing multiple hats)
- **Systems Architecture:** Mekaiel - 20%
- **Technical Support:** Matthew - 15%
- **Learning/Process:** Chris - 6%
- **Support Owner:** Built into Trent's Tech Lead role

**Wait, let's recalculate:**
- Trent: 15% + 18% + 30% = 63% (too high!)

**BETTER APPROACH:**

When one person holds multiple roles, use combined caps:
- **Originator + Client Lead (Trent):** 30% combined (not 15% + 18%)
- **Technical Lead (Trent):** 35%
- **Total Trent:** 65%

**Remaining 35% split among:**
- Mekaiel (Systems Architecture): 20%
- Matthew (Technical Support): 15%
- **Total: 100%**

**Final Split for $9,000:**
- Trent: 65% = $5,850
- Mekaiel: 20% = $1,800
- Matthew: 15% = $1,350
- **Total: $9,000 ✓**

**Is 65% fair for Trent?**
→ Yes, he originated, managed client, AND did most technical work. He earned it.

---

### SCENARIO 3: Defense Contractor ($10,000) WITH Learning Role

**Client:** DoD contractor, automate security reporting

**Roles:**
- **Originator:** Mekaiel (his defense network) - 15%
- **Client Lead:** Chris (runs project) - 18%
- **Technical Lead:** Matthew (builds software) - 37%
- **Systems Architecture:** Mekaiel (security compliance, integration) - 15%
- **Technical Support:** None (Matthew handles it solo)
- **Support Owner:** Matthew - 7% (included in Tech Lead)
- **Learning/Process:** Trent (learning defense/gov compliance) - 6%

**Split:**
- Originator: 15%
- Client Lead: 18%
- Technical Lead: 37% (includes support)
- Systems Architecture: 15%
- Learning/Process: 6%
- **Total: 91%** ← Need to adjust

**Redistributed to hit 100%:**
- Originator (Mekaiel): 16%
- Client Lead (Chris): 19%
- Technical Lead (Matthew): 40%
- Systems Architecture (Mekaiel): 16%
- Learning (Trent): 6%
- Support Owner: Included in Matthew's 40%
- **Total: 97%** ← Still off

**FINAL CORRECTED:**
- Originator (Mekaiel): 15%
- Client Lead (Chris): 19%
- Technical Lead (Matthew): 40%
- Systems Architecture (Mekaiel): 16%
- Learning (Trent): 6%
- **Wait, Mekaiel gets 15% + 16% = 31%? Let me recalculate from scratch.**

---

**CLEAN SLATE CALCULATION:**

**Roles needed:**
1. Originator: 15%
2. Client Lead: 19%
3. Technical Lead (includes Support): 40%
4. Systems Architecture: 20%
5. Learning/Process: 6%
**Total: 100% ✓**

**Who:**
- Mekaiel: Originator (15%) + Systems Architecture (20%) = 35%
- Chris: Client Lead (19%)
- Matthew: Technical Lead (40%, includes Support Owner)
- Trent: Learning (6%)

**Final $10,000 Project Split:**
- Mekaiel: 35% = $3,500
- Matthew: 40% = $4,000
- Chris: 19% = $1,900
- Trent: 6% = $600
- **Total: 100% = $10,000 ✓**

**This works.**

---

## KEY INSIGHT FROM SCENARIOS:

**The percentages in your framework are STARTING RANGES, not fixed amounts.**

**Per project, you'll:**
1. Identify roles needed
2. Assign starting % per role
3. Adjust to total 100%
4. Account for role overlaps (one person, multiple roles)
5. Document agreed split before work starts

**It's NOT rigid - it's a negotiation framework.**

---
