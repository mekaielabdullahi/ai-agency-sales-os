# TRANSFORMATION PREREQUISITES FRAMEWORK
## What Clients Need at Each Phase (And What We Deliver)

**Purpose:** Clear prerequisites for each transformation phase to qualify clients, set expectations, and prevent project delays.

**Version:** 1.0
**Date:** December 2, 2025

---

## HOW TO USE THIS FRAMEWORK

### During Discovery (Q1-Q5 Call)
Use this to assess: **"Does this client have what's needed for success?"**

### During Proposal
Include relevant prerequisites in the **"What We Need From You"** section

### During Project
Use as checklist to ensure smooth phase transitions

---

## PHASE 0: PRE-DISCOVERY PREREQUISITES

### What Client Must Have BEFORE We Even Talk

**Minimum Requirements (Deal-Breakers if Missing):**

✅ **Decision-Making Authority**
- Person on call can approve $5K-$10K budget
- Or has direct access to decision-maker
- Can make timeline commitments

✅ **Clear Pain Point**
- Can articulate specific problem (not just "want AI")
- Problem costs them measurable time or money monthly
- Problem is operational (not theoretical)

✅ **Timeline Readiness**
- Can start within 30-60 days
- Has capacity for weekly check-ins
- Willing to commit team time for training

✅ **Budget Exists**
- Has allocated or can allocate $5K-$10K
- Understands this is investment, not expense
- Past attempts show willingness to spend

**Red Flags (Disqualify or Delay):**
- ❌ "Just exploring" with no budget or timeline
- ❌ "Need to convince my boss first" (not decision-maker)
- ❌ "Want it for free/cheap" (price shopping)
- ❌ Wants spec work or proof-of-concept before paying
- ❌ Unrealistic timeline ("need it in 2 weeks")

## RED FLAGS: MISSING PREREQUISITES THAT DELAY PROJECTS

### Most Common Issues (And How to Handle)

**RED FLAG #1: "We'll get you access later"**
- **Impact:** Delays Phase 2 by 1-4 weeks
- **Solution:** Make system access a contract requirement
- **Add to SOW:** "Project timeline starts upon receipt of system access"

**RED FLAG #2: "Our IT team is slow to approve vendors"**
- **Impact:** Delays project start by 2-8 weeks
- **Solution:** Identify this during discovery, factor into timeline
- **Add to SOW:** "Client responsible for internal approvals within 14 days"

**RED FLAG #3: "We don't have documentation for our current process"**
- **Impact:** Adds 1-2 weeks to Phase 2 (we have to document it)
- **Solution:** Include process documentation as Phase 2 deliverable
- **Add to pricing:** Charge for documentation time

**RED FLAG #4: "Our data is a mess"**
- **Impact:** Adds 2-4 weeks to Phase 2 (data cleaning)
- **Solution:** Assess during discovery, price data cleaning separately
- **Add to SOW:** "Data cleaning prerequisite: $X,XXX additional"

**RED FLAG #5: "We're not sure who should be trained"**
- **Impact:** Delays Phase 4 by 1-2 weeks (scheduling issues)
- **Solution:** Define training participants during Phase 2 kickoff
- **Add to SOW:** "Client identifies training participants by Week 8"

**RED FLAG #6: "We can't commit to weekly check-ins"**
- **Impact:** Project drags out, communication breaks down
- **Solution:** Set expectation during discovery, make it contract requirement
- **Add to SOW:** "Weekly 30-min check-ins required, rescheduling allowed with 24hr notice"

## HOW TO USE THIS IN Q1-Q5 DISCOVERY

### Embed Prerequisites Questions Into Q1-Q5 Framework

**During Q1 (What do you do?):**
- Listen for: Complexity of systems, number of stakeholders, compliance requirements
- Assess: Will they be able to provide system access?

**During Q2 (What does this cost you?):**
- Listen for: Budget indicators, past spending on solutions
- Assess: Is budget sufficient for prerequisites + AI?

**During Q3 (What have you tried?):**
- Listen for: Why past solutions failed (often missing prerequisites!)
- Assess: Do they understand prerequisites are needed?

**During Q4 (Why didn't it work?):**
- Listen for: Data issues, integration problems, lack of adoption
- Assess: Are these prerequisite gaps we can fill?

**During Q5 (Magic wand solution?):**
- Listen for: Unrealistic expectations (AI without foundation)
- Assess: Can we set realistic expectations about phased approach?

**THEN ADD Q6 (Internal Prerequisites Assessment):**
- Based on Q1-Q5, what prerequisites are they missing?
- How much time/cost to build prerequisites?
- Are they willing to do prerequisites first?
