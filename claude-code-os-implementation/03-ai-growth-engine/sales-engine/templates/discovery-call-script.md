**Step 3: Explain What's Included**
> "In the audit, we'll:

---

## Common Objections & Responses

### "We're already using [Tool] for this"
> "That's great that you have [Tool] in place. What we typically find is that businesses have multiple tools that don't talk to each other. Our focus is on connecting those systems and automating the gaps between them. Does that resonate?"

### "We don't have time for this right now"
> "I completely understand—and that's actually the exact problem automation solves. The businesses that benefit most from automation are the ones that are too busy. The audit itself only requires about 2-3 hours of your time total, and it's designed to save you 10-20 hours per week once implemented."

### "How much does this cost?"
> "Great question. Our automation systems typically range from $3,000 to $12,000 depending on scope. The AI Audit will give us the exact scope so we can provide you with precise pricing. Most clients see ROI within 60-90 days through time savings and recovered revenue."

### "I need to talk to my business partner"
> "Absolutely, that makes sense. Would it be helpful to schedule a brief call with both of you so I can answer any questions together?"

### "Can you just send me some information?"
> "I'm happy to send over information, but the challenge is that every business is unique. The audit is really where the value is—it's custom to your specific situation. That said, I'll send you a one-pager on what we do. Can we schedule a quick 10-minute follow-up call next week to discuss?"
