**Speaker Notes**: Welcome everyone. Today we're learning the framework that will transform how you close deals. By the end of this session, you'll know exactly how to qualify, price, and close any lead using just 5 questions.

---

## SLIDE 2: The Problem with Traditional Sales

**MOST SALES REPS DO THIS:**

❌ Lead comes in
❌ Immediately pitch product/features
❌ Talk about what WE do
❌ Offer generic pricing
❌ Hope they buy

**RESULT:**
- Low close rates (5-10%)
- Price resistance
- Long sales cycles
- Wrong-fit clients

**Speaker Notes**: Show of hands—how many of you have pitched a lead and they said "I'll think about it" or "that's too expensive"? That's because we're selling what WE have, not what THEY need.

---

## SLIDE 3: The Arise Group Way

**WE DO THIS:**

✅ Ask strategic questions
✅ Uncover THEIR problem
✅ Quantify THEIR cost
✅ Amplify THEIR pain
✅ Let THEM design the solution

**RESULT:**
- High close rates (30%+)
- Premium pricing (zero resistance)
- Fast sales cycles (<14 days)
- Perfect-fit clients

**Speaker Notes**: The difference? We diagnose first, prescribe second. Like a doctor. You wouldn't want a doctor who prescribes medicine without asking questions first, would you?

---

## SLIDE 4: Framework Philosophy

**CORE PRINCIPLE:**

> "You don't close leads by pitching solutions.
> You close leads by uncovering problems, quantifying pain,
> and letting prospects sell themselves."

**THE ARISE ADVANTAGE:**
- Competitors pitch features → We diagnose problems
- Competitors talk about AI tools → We talk about money saved
- Competitors hope for a sale → We engineer a close

**Speaker Notes**: This framework is based on consultative selling psychology. When prospects tell you their problems, costs, and ideal solution—they're literally writing your proposal FOR you.

```

**Speaker Notes**: These 5 questions—in this exact order—will give you everything you need to close. Let's break down each one.

---

## SLIDE 6: Q1 - Problem Discovery

**QUESTION:**
"What is the biggest problem in your business right now?"

**PURPOSE:**
- Qualify the lead (do they have a real problem?)
- Understand their world (not yours)
- Build rapport through curiosity

**WHAT YOU'RE LEARNING:**
- Is there a problem we can solve?
- Do they recognize it?
- How do they describe it? (Use their words later!)

**COMMON MISTAKE:**
❌ They tell you their problem → You immediately pitch

**CORRECT APPROACH:**
✅ They tell you their problem → You validate, dig deeper, move to Q2

**Speaker Notes**: Your only job at Q1 is to LISTEN. Resist the urge to pitch. You don't know enough yet. Just listen, validate, and move to Q2.

---

## SLIDE 7: Q2 - Cost Quantification

**QUESTION:**
"How much is this problem costing the business per month?"

**PURPOSE:**
- Quantify the pain in dollars
- Establish your pricing ceiling
- Make the problem real (not abstract)

**WHAT YOU'RE LEARNING:**
- What's the budget? (You'll price at 30-50% of this number)
- How urgent is this? (Higher cost = more urgent)
- Do they understand the real cost? (If not, help them calculate)

**PRICING MATH:**
If Q2 = $20K/month problem → You charge $6K-10K/month
Why? Because they net $10K-14K/month in savings = easy ROI

**Speaker Notes**: This is THE most important question for pricing. If they say "$50K/month problem" you can charge $15K-25K. If they say "$500/month problem" you're looking at $150-250. The problem cost dictates your price.

---

## SLIDE 8: Q2 - Handling "I Don't Know"

**IF THEY SAY:** "I'm not sure what it costs"

**YOU SAY:**
"Totally fair. Let me ask it this way:
- How many hours per week does your team spend on this?
- What's that costing in salaries?
- Any lost revenue or missed opportunities?
- Ballpark—is this a $1K/month problem? $10K? $50K?"

**GOAL:** Get them to put a number on it
**WHY:** You can't price what you can't quantify

**Speaker Notes**: Don't let them off the hook on Q2. If they can't quantify the cost, they won't buy a solution. Help them do the math. Walk them through it.

---

## SLIDE 9: Q3 - Timeline Assessment

**QUESTION:**
"How long have you had this problem for?"

**PURPOSE:**
- Assess urgency (chronic pain = more desperate)
- Understand why they haven't solved it yet
- Uncover budget history (have they tried solutions before?)

**WHAT YOU'RE LEARNING:**
- Is this new (low urgency) or old (high urgency)?
- Have they tried to fix it? What failed?
- How much have they already lost? (Q2 × months = total pain)

**ADVANCED TACTIC - Cost Amplification:**
If they say "2 years" and Q2 was $10K/month:
"So this has cost you $240K so far?"
(Makes the pain massive and concrete)

**Speaker Notes**: The longer they've had the problem, the more desperate they are for a solution. Use Q3 to amplify the cost over time.

---

## SLIDE 10: Q4 - Consequence Amplification

**QUESTION:**
"If you do nothing, what does the next 6 to 12 months look like?"

**PURPOSE:**
- Create emotional urgency
- Make inaction more painful than action
- Overcome "I'll think about it" objection

**WHAT YOU'RE LEARNING:**
- Do they understand the stakes?
- Is there a consequence to waiting?
- What's their fear? (Use this in your close)

**WHY THIS WORKS:**
People buy to avoid pain more than to gain pleasure.
Q4 = Paint the picture of pain if they don't act.

**Speaker Notes**: This is where you create urgency without being pushy. You're not creating fake scarcity—you're helping them see the real consequence of inaction using their own logic.

---

## SLIDE 11: Q4 - The Consequence Ladder

**IF THEIR Q4 ANSWER IS WEAK:**

Them: "I guess things will stay the same."

**YOU ASK:** "And if that happens, then what?"

Them: "Well, we'll keep wasting time on manual processes."

**YOU ASK:** "And if that continues for 12 months, then what?"

Them: "I guess we'll fall further behind our competitors. Probably lose market share."

**YOU ASK:** "And then what?"

Them: "We might miss our growth targets. Could affect funding."

**NOW you have real stakes.**

**Speaker Notes**: Keep asking "and then what?" until you hit real emotional pain. That's where urgency lives.

---

## SLIDE 12: Q5 - Magic Wand Solution

**QUESTION:**
"If I had a magic wand and could build the perfect solution to fix this problem, what would that look like?"

**PURPOSE:**
- Let THEM design the solution (not you)
- Understand their vision of success
- Create your proposal blueprint

**WHAT YOU'RE LEARNING:**
- What do they ACTUALLY want? (Not what you want to sell)
- What does success look like to them?
- What features/outcomes matter most?

**CRITICAL:**
Your proposal should use their EXACT words from Q5.
They describe it → You build it (or show how you already have it)

**Speaker Notes**: This is the game-changer. Most reps pitch what they have. You're going to pitch what THEY want. By using their language from Q5, your proposal will feel like you read their mind.

---

## SLIDE 13: The Full Flow - Live Example

**SCENARIO:** Marketing Director at B2B SaaS company

**Q1:** "What's the biggest problem in your business right now?"
**A1:** "Sales team drowning in unqualified leads. Volume is high but conversion is terrible."

**Q2:** "How much is this costing you per month?"
**A2:** "$30K on lead gen + 60% of sales time wasted = ~$45K/month total."

**Q3:** "How long has this been an issue?"
**A3:** "About 8 months. Got worse when we scaled ad spend."

**Q4:** "If you do nothing, what does the next 6-12 months look like?"
**A4:** "We'll have to hire more SDRs or cut ad spend. Either way, we miss growth targets."

**Q5:** "Magic wand—what's the perfect solution?"
**A5:** "AI system that pre-qualifies leads before sales sees them. Only books qualified meetings."

**Speaker Notes**: Now watch how we turn this into a proposal...

---

## SLIDE 14: Turning Q1-Q5 Into a Close

**YOUR PITCH (Using their exact language):**

"Okay, so based on what you just told me:

✓ You're spending **$45K/month** on unqualified leads [Q2]
✓ This has been going on for **8 months** [Q3]
✓ If nothing changes, you'll **miss growth targets** [Q4]
✓ What you need is an **AI system that pre-qualifies and only books qualified meetings** [Q5]

Good news—we built exactly that for [similar company].

**Investment:** $15K/month
**Savings:** $30K/month (net $30K savings)
**Timeline:** Live in 2 weeks

Make sense?"

**Speaker Notes**: Notice how you didn't pitch features? You pitched THEIR solution, using THEIR words. The close is natural because you've already qualified budget, urgency, and need.

---

## SLIDE 15: The 3 Golden Rules

**RULE #1: Questions Flow in Order**
Never skip ahead. Each builds on the previous.
- Q1 without Q2 = no pricing context
- Q5 without Q1-Q4 = solution without problem

**RULE #2: Listen More Than You Talk**
Your job in Q1-Q5 is to EXTRACT, not provide.
- Ask → Shut up → Listen → Clarify → Move on

**RULE #3: Their Answers ARE Your Proposal**
By Q5, you know:
- The problem (Q1)
- The budget (Q2)
- The urgency (Q3)
- Why they must act (Q4)
- What to build (Q5)

**You're not pitching—you're prescribing.**

**Speaker Notes**: If you remember nothing else, remember these 3 rules. Follow them and your close rate will skyrocket.

---

## SLIDE 16: Common Mistakes - Pitching Too Early

**WRONG:**

Lead: "Our biggest problem is unqualified leads."
You: "Perfect! We have an AI solution that solves that. Let me show you..."

**WHY IT FAILS:**
You don't know cost, urgency, or what they actually want.

**RIGHT:**

Lead: "Our biggest problem is unqualified leads."
You: "That's frustrating. How much is that costing you per month?"

**WHY IT WORKS:**
You're gathering the data you need to build the perfect pitch later.

**Speaker Notes**: The hardest part of this framework is discipline. Resist the urge to pitch at Q1. Trust the process.

---

## SLIDE 17: Common Mistakes - Not Quantifying Q2

**WRONG:**

You: "How much is this costing you?"
Them: "A lot."
You: "Got it." [Moves to Q3]

**WHY IT FAILS:**
No pricing anchor. Can't calculate ROI. Can't justify your price.

**RIGHT:**

You: "How much is this costing you?"
Them: "A lot."
You: "Ballpark—is that $1K/month? $10K? $50K?"
Them: "Probably closer to $20K."
You: "Got it, thanks."

**Speaker Notes**: Push for a number. If they won't give one, help them calculate it. "How many hours? What's your team's salary? Any lost revenue?" Walk them through the math.

---

## SLIDE 18: Common Mistakes - Skipping Q4

**WRONG:**

Q3: "How long has this been an issue?"
Them: "About 6 months."
You: "Got it. Magic wand—what's the perfect solution?"

**WHY IT FAILS:**
No urgency. They'll say "I'll think about it" because there's no pain in waiting.

**RIGHT:**

Q3: "How long has this been an issue?"
Them: "About 6 months."
You: "If you do nothing, what does the next 6-12 months look like?"
Them: "Honestly, it'll get worse. We'll fall behind competitors."

**NOW you have urgency.**

**Speaker Notes**: Q4 is the difference between "nice to have" and "must have now." Never skip it.

---

## SLIDE 19: Common Mistakes - Not Using Their Language

**WRONG:**

Q5: "Magic wand solution?"
Them: "I wish we had a system that automatically filters bad leads."
You: "Great! Here's our AI-powered lead scoring platform with machine learning algorithms..."

**WHY IT FAILS:**
They said "filters bad leads" and you said "machine learning algorithms." You're speaking different languages.

**RIGHT:**

Q5: "Magic wand solution?"
Them: "I wish we had a system that automatically filters bad leads."
You: "So a system that automatically filters bad leads before they hit your team. We built exactly that. Here's how..."

**Use their exact words.**

**Speaker Notes**: Copy/paste their Q5 answer into your proposal. Use their language, not yours. It makes them feel heard.

---

## SLIDE 20: Channel Deployment - Email

**Email 1: Q1 Only**
```
Subject: Quick question

Hey [Name],

[Context for outreach]

What's the biggest problem in your [business area] right now?

[Your Name]
```

**Email 2: Q2 & Q3** (only if they reply)
**Email 3: Q4 & Q5** (only if they reply)
**Email 4: Proposal** (only after all 5 answered)

**KEY:** One or two questions per email. Don't overwhelm.

**Speaker Notes**: We'll give you templates for all of these. The key is patience—build the conversation over multiple touches.

---

## SLIDE 21: Channel Deployment - Phone Calls

**Opening:**
"Hey [Name], before I dive into what we do, one question: What's the biggest problem in your business right now?"

**Flow:**
Q1 → Validate → Q2 → Q3 → Q4 → Q5 → Pitch

**Pace:**
Don't rush. Let them talk. Pause between questions.

**Tone:**
Curious, not interrogating. You're a consultant, not a salesperson.

**Close:**
"Based on what you just told me, here's what I'd propose..."
[Use their Q1-Q5 answers]

**Speaker Notes**: On calls, you can get through all 5 questions in 10-15 minutes if you flow naturally. The key is listening and not interrupting.

---

## SLIDE 22: Channel Deployment - LinkedIn DMs

**Message 1: Q1**
```
Hey [Name], saw [context].

Quick question: What's the biggest problem you're dealing with in [their area] right now?
```

**Message 2: Q2 & Q3** (if they reply)
**Message 3: Q4 & Q5** (if they reply)
**Message 4: Calendar link** (if they reply)

**LinkedIn Strategy:**
- Short messages (2-3 sentences max)
- Genuine curiosity
- No pitching until they've answered Q1-Q5

**Speaker Notes**: LinkedIn is a slower burn. Most people won't answer all 5 in DMs. Goal is usually to get them on a call after Q1-Q2.

---

## SLIDE 23: Pricing Strategy from Q2

**PRICING FORMULA:**

Q2 Answer (Monthly Cost) × 0.3 to 0.5 = Your Price

**EXAMPLES:**

| Q2: Problem Cost | Your Price (30-50%) | Net Savings |
|-----------------|---------------------|-------------|
| $10K/month | $3K-5K/month | $5K-7K |
| $25K/month | $7.5K-12.5K/month | $12.5K-17.5K |
| $50K/month | $15K-25K/month | $25K-35K |
| $100K/month | $30K-50K/month | $50K-70K |

**WHY THIS WORKS:**
They're already losing the money. You're offering to save them 50-70% of it.
ROI is built-in and obvious.

**Speaker Notes**: This is why Q2 is so critical. It tells you exactly what to charge. If you price above 50% of Q2, they'll negotiate. Below 30%, you're leaving money on the table.

---

## SLIDE 24: Objection Handling - "I Need to Think About It"

**WRONG RESPONSE:**
"Okay, let me know when you're ready."

**RIGHT RESPONSE (Using Q4):**
"Totally fair. Just to clarify—you mentioned that if nothing changes, [their Q4 consequence]. How much longer can you afford to wait?"

**WHY THIS WORKS:**
You're using their own logic (Q4) to create urgency.
Not pushy—just helping them see their own stated consequence.

**Speaker Notes**: When they say "I'll think about it," it usually means they don't feel urgency. Return to Q4. Remind them what happens if they do nothing.

---

## SLIDE 25: Objection Handling - "That's Too Expensive"

**WRONG RESPONSE:**
"I can offer a discount."

**RIGHT RESPONSE (Using Q2):**
"I hear you. Just to make sure we're on the same page—you mentioned this problem is costing you [Q2 amount] per month. This solution is [your price], which saves you [Q2 minus your price] per month. Does the ROI not work?"

**WHY THIS WORKS:**
You're reframing price as savings using their own numbers.

**MOST COMMON OUTCOME:**
They realize it's actually cheap compared to the problem cost.

**Speaker Notes**: "Too expensive" usually means they don't see the value. Return to Q2 and do the ROI math out loud.

---

## SLIDE 26: Objection Handling - "We Already Have a Solution"

**WRONG RESPONSE:**
"Ours is better because..."

**RIGHT RESPONSE (Using Q1 & Q5):**
"Got it. Can I ask—if you already have a solution, why did you say [their Q1 problem] is still your biggest issue? And is your current solution giving you [their Q5 magic wand outcome]?"

**WHY THIS WORKS:**
Their current solution clearly isn't working (they still have the problem).
You're just highlighting the gap.

**MOST COMMON OUTCOME:**
They admit their current solution isn't working.

**Speaker Notes**: If they already have a solution but still have the problem, the solution isn't working. Use Q1 and Q5 to expose the gap.

---

## SLIDE 27: Data Collection - What to Track

**FOR EVERY LEAD, TRACK:**

| Field | Data Point | Why |
|-------|-----------|-----|
| **Problem** | Q1 Answer | Pain point database |
| **Monthly Cost** | Q2 Answer | Pricing intelligence |
| **Timeline** | Q3 Answer | Urgency scoring |
| **Consequence** | Q4 Answer | Objection handling library |
| **Magic Wand** | Q5 Answer | Product roadmap |
| **Industry** | Metadata | Pattern recognition |
| **Company Size** | Metadata | Segmentation |
| **Close Status** | Won/Lost | Win rate analysis |

**After 50 conversations:** You'll know the top problems per industry
**After 100 conversations:** You'll know exactly how to price per problem type
**After 200 conversations:** You'll have a library of magic wand solutions to reuse

**Speaker Notes**: This data becomes your competitive advantage. You'll know more about your market than anyone else.

---

## SLIDE 28: Success Metrics - What Good Looks Like

| Metric | Target | What It Tells You |
|--------|--------|------------------|
| **Q1 Response Rate** | 40%+ | Your hook is working |
| **Q1 → Q2 Progression** | 70%+ | Good qualification |
| **Q2 → Q5 Completion** | 60%+ | Strong conversation control |
| **Q5 → Proposal** | 90%+ | You're following through |
| **Proposal → Close** | 30%+ | Framework is working |
| **Avg Deal Size** | Tracking | Should correlate with Q2 |
| **Days to Close** | <14 days | Efficiency |

**BASELINE:**
If you're closing 30%+ of leads who complete Q1-Q5, the framework is working.

**Speaker Notes**: Track these weekly. If your Q1 response rate is low, your hook needs work. If Q1→Q2 progression is low, you're not qualifying properly. The data tells you where to improve.

---

## SLIDE 29: Team Competition - Gamification

**WEEKLY LEADERBOARD:**
- 🏆 Most Q1-Q5 completions
- 💰 Highest average Q2 cost uncovered
- 🎯 Most closes
- ⭐ Best Q5 "magic wand" answer (team vote)
- 📈 Highest close rate %

**MONTHLY PRIZES:**
- Top closer: Bonus
- Best Q4 consequence: Team dinner
- Most creative Q5→proposal conversion: Recognition

**WHY THIS WORKS:**
Makes learning the framework fun and competitive.

**Speaker Notes**: We'll track this as a team. Celebrate wins together. Learn from each other's Q1-Q5 data.

---

## SLIDE 30: Practice Exercise #1 - Role Play

**SETUP:**

1. E-commerce brand with high cart abandonment
2. B2B SaaS with low lead quality
3. Professional services firm with manual workflows
4. Real estate agency with inconsistent lead follow-up

**DEBRIEF:**
- Did the rep listen or pitch too early?
- Did they get a Q2 number?
- Did they use prospect's language in Q5?

**Speaker Notes**: [PAUSE FOR EXERCISE - 15 minutes total]

---

## SLIDE 31: Practice Exercise #2 - Email Writing

**TASK:**
Write a 4-email sequence using the framework.

**SCENARIO:**
Marketing Director at a B2B company (your choice of industry)

**REQUIREMENTS:**
- Email 1: Q1 only
- Email 2: Q2 & Q3
- Email 3: Q4 & Q5
- Email 4: Proposal (make up their Q1-Q5 answers)

**TIME:** 15 minutes

**DEBRIEF:**
Share your Email 1 with the group. Which subject lines work best?

**Speaker Notes**: [PAUSE FOR EXERCISE - 20 minutes total]

---

## SLIDE 32: Practice Exercise #3 - Pricing from Q2

**SCENARIO:**
Lead says: "This problem is costing us about $30K per month."

**YOUR TASKS:**
1. Calculate your price range (30-50% of Q2)
2. Calculate net savings for the client
3. Write the pricing pitch using Q2 data

**ANSWER:**
- Your price: $9K-15K/month
- Net savings: $15K-21K/month
- Pitch: "You mentioned this is costing $30K/month. Our solution is $12K/month, which saves you $18K per month. That's a $216K annual savings."

**Speaker Notes**: [PAUSE FOR EXERCISE - 10 minutes total]

---

## SLIDE 33: Going Live - Your First 10 Leads

**THIS WEEK:**

✅ **Each team member runs framework on 10 leads**
✅ **Track all Q1-Q5 answers in CRM**
✅ **Don't worry about closing yet—focus on the process**

**GOAL:**
Get comfortable asking the questions naturally.

**DEBRIEF FRIDAY:**
- What worked?
- What felt awkward?
- What did you learn about our market?
- What Q2 costs are we seeing?
- What Q5 solutions keep coming up?

**Speaker Notes**: Learning happens by doing. Your first 10 will feel clunky. That's normal. By lead 20-30, it'll feel natural.

---

## SLIDE 34: Framework Mastery Checklist

**YOU'VE MASTERED THIS WHEN YOU CAN:**

---

## SLIDE 37: The Real Secret

**HERE'S THE TRUTH:**

This framework isn't about being clever or manipulative.

**IT'S ABOUT:**

1. **Caring enough to ask real questions**
2. **Listening more than you talk**
3. **Building solutions people actually want**
4. **Pricing based on value, not hours**
5. **Closing because you've earned it, not because you pushed**

**WHEN YOU DO THIS RIGHT:**

Closing feels easy.
Because by the time you pitch, they've already decided to buy.
They just need you to confirm you can deliver what they described.

**Speaker Notes**: The best salespeople aren't slick talkers. They're great listeners who genuinely care about solving problems. That's what this framework teaches you to be.
