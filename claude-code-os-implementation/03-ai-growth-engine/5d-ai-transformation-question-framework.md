## 📊 QUESTION GENERATION SYSTEM

### Core Principle:
**Questions must map to transformation phases AND business operations layers**

### The Matrix:

```
                DISCOVER  DESIGN   DEVELOP  DEPLOY   DRIVE
                   ↓        ↓        ↓        ↓       ↓
OPERATIONS      [  Q1  ] [  Q2  ] [  Q3  ] [  Q4  ] [ Q5  ]
SALES           [  Q6  ] [  Q7  ] [  Q8  ] [  Q9  ] [ Q10 ]
MARKETING       [  Q11 ] [  Q12 ] [  Q13 ] [  Q14 ] [ Q15 ]
SERVICE         [  Q16 ] [  Q17 ] [  Q18 ] [  Q19 ] [ Q20 ]
FINANCE         [  Q21 ] [  Q22 ] [  Q23 ] [  Q24 ] [ Q25 ]
HR/PEOPLE       [  Q26 ] [  Q27 ] [  Q28 ] [  Q29 ] [ Q30 ]
```

Each intersection = specific question category

## 🔍 PHASE 1: DISCOVER
**Purpose**: Uncover current state, pain points, and AI readiness
**Question Focus**: What exists today? What's broken? What's manual?

### DISCOVER Question Framework:

#### Business Operations Layer:
**Template**: "How do you currently [PROCESS]? What breaks? What's manual?"

**Core Discovery Questions**:
1. **Current State Mapping**
   - "Walk me through how [OPERATION] works today from start to finish."
   - "What systems/tools are you using for [FUNCTION]?"
   - "How many people touch [PROCESS] before it's complete?"

2. **Pain Point Identification**
   - "Where does [PROCESS] typically slow down or break?"
   - "What takes the most time in [OPERATION]?"
   - "What are you doing manually that you wish was automated?"

3. **Data & System Assessment**
   - "What data do you collect during [PROCESS]?"
   - "How do you currently track/measure [METRIC]?"
   - "Do your systems talk to each other, or is there manual handoff?"

4. **AI Readiness Check**

## 💡 POSITIONING AS AI TRANSFORMATION PARTNER

### How Questions Position You:

**DISCOVER Questions** → Show you understand their business deeply
**DESIGN Questions** → Position you as strategic advisor, not vendor
**DEVELOP Questions** → Demonstrate technical expertise
**DEPLOY Questions** → Show you care about adoption, not just delivery
**DRIVE Questions** → Position long-term partnership, not project

### Language Patterns:

**Don't say**: "We build AI solutions"
**Do say**: "We transform business operations through systematic AI adoption"

**Don't say**: "What do you want us to build?"
**Do say**: "Let's discover where AI can unlock the most value in your operations"

**Don't say**: "This will be done in 6 weeks"
**Do say**: "We'll develop the solution, deploy it with your team, and drive continuous improvement"
