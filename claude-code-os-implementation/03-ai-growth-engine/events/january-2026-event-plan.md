### The $99 Offer Pitch Script

```
"Here's what I'm seeing from your breakout discussions:

Everyone found at least 1-3 processes that could be automated.

But here's the challenge - you found them in 20 minutes of brainstorming.

Imagine what you'd find with a systematic analysis of your ENTIRE business.

That's what we do at AriseGroup.ai with our Business Documentation & Process Map.

We spend 2-3 hours mapping every process in your business, then identify:
→ Which processes drain your time
→ Which are automation-ready
→ Which to tackle first for maximum ROI

Normal price: $299
Today, for attendees only: $99

Plus attendee bonus: [BONUS TBD]

Link is in the chat. Limited to first [NUMBER TBD] to ensure quality.

Questions about this?"

## 📋 QUESTIONS FOR KRISTA (Offer Coach Meeting)

### AI Framework Development
1. What's a proven framework structure for teaching AI adoption? (3-step? 4-phase?)
2. Should it be diagnostic (identify problems) or prescriptive (here's the path)?
3. What makes a framework 'sticky' enough that people remember and share it?
4. How do I position this framework so it's valuable standalone BUT also shows they need help implementing?
5. Should I give them the whole framework or just enough to want more?
6. What's the balance between education and selling?

### Content & Delivery
7. What are the 3 biggest mistakes businesses make with AI adoption?
8. What quick wins can I promise they'll identify during the event?
9. How do I make 20 minutes of teaching feel like massive value?
10. How do I naturally transition from teaching to the $99 offer without feeling salesy?

### Breakout Exercise
11. I'm thinking of a "PB&J exercise" for breakout rooms - thoughts on this for AI topic?
12. What makes a breakout room exercise effective for lead generation?
13. How much guidance should I give? Worksheet? Just a prompt?

### Conversion Strategy
14. What's the best attendee-only bonus to drive conversions?
15. Should I limit spots (scarcity) or keep it open?
16. How do I handle the pitch without killing the vibe?
17. What follow-up sequence works best after these events?
18. Should I pitch intro calls or $99 offer directly?
19. How long should I wait to follow up? Same day? Next day?

### Partnership Opportunities
20. Is there a way we could collaborate on this event? (Co-host? Promotion?)
21. Do you have an audience that would benefit from this topic?
22. What would make this valuable enough for you to promote?

### Funnel Validation
23. Does my funnel make sense? ($99 → Clarity Report → Implementation → Management)
24. Where do most offers like mine break down? How do I avoid that?
25. What pricing should I be thinking about at each stage?

### Strategic Guidance
26. Given my $0→$50K/month goal, is this event strategy the right move?
