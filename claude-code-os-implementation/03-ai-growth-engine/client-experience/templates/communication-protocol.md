## Emergency Communication Protocol

### Definition of Emergency

An emergency is a **production issue** affecting client operations:
- Automation system down or not functioning
- Data loss or corruption
- Security breach or unauthorized access
- Critical workflow failure affecting customers

**NOT emergencies:** Questions, feature requests, training needs, minor bugs

---

### Emergency Response Process

**For Client:**
1. Call project lead directly: [Phone]
2. If no answer, email with subject: **URGENT - Production Issue - [Client Name]**
3. Describe issue clearly and impact on business

**From Arise Team:**
1. Acknowledge within 2 hours
2. Provide initial assessment within 4 hours
3. Provide resolution or workaround within 24 hours
4. Post-incident report within 48 hours

---

### Emergency Communication Template

**Subject:** URGENT - Production Issue - [Client Name] - [Brief Description]

Hi [Engineer Name],

We have a production emergency for [Client Name].

**Issue:** [Clear description]
**Impact:** [Business impact - e.g., "No leads being captured"]
**Started:** [When did this begin?]
**Client contacted:** [Date/Time]
**Urgency:** Critical / High

**Next Steps:**
[What you're doing immediately]

**Client Notification:**
[Have you notified client? What did you tell them?]

Please respond ASAP.

---

## Client Communication Principles

### 1. Clarity Over Speed
Don't rush responses. A clear, thoughtful answer is better than a fast, confusing one.

---

### 2. Proactive > Reactive
Don't wait for clients to ask. Anticipate questions and address them upfront.

**Bad:** Wait for client to ask "Where are we with the project?"
**Good:** Send weekly updates before they have to ask.

---

### 3. Honesty Always
If there's a delay, own it. If you don't know, say so.

**Bad:** "Everything's fine!" (when it's not)
**Good:** "We hit a snag with [X]. Here's our plan to fix it: [Y]."

---

### 4. No Jargon
Translate technical concepts into business outcomes.

**Bad:** "The webhook endpoint is returning 401 errors."
**Good:** "The connection between your website and CRM isn't working. We're fixing it now."

---

### 5. Assume Positive Intent
If a client sounds frustrated, they're stressed—not attacking you. Respond with empathy.

**Bad:** Defensive response
**Good:** "I understand this is frustrating. Let me make it right."

---

### 6. Document Everything
If it's important, put it in writing (email or Notion). Don't rely on verbal-only agreements.

---

### 7. Over-Communicate Timeline Changes
Clients hate surprises. If a timeline shifts, tell them immediately—not a week later.

---

### 8. Celebrate Wins
Don't just communicate problems. Celebrate milestones, progress, and successes.

---

## Communication Cadence by Project Phase

### Week 1-2 (Onboarding & Architecture):
- Frequency: High (daily or every other day)
- Method: Email + calls
- Purpose: Gather information, build trust

- Frequency: Weekly
- Method: Email updates
- Purpose: Keep client informed, maintain confidence

### Weeks 5-6 (Testing & Training):

---

## Client Escalation Protocol

### If Client Unresponsive

**Day 1:** Initial request sent
**Day 3:** Friendly reminder sent
**Day 5:** Second reminder with timeline impact noted
**Day 7:** Escalation email to client + internal team
**Day 10:** Project pause notification

---

### Escalation Email Template

**Subject:** [Client Name] Project - Action Needed to Avoid Delay

Hi [Client Name],

I've reached out a few times regarding [item needed], and I haven't heard back yet.

**What We Need:**
[Specific item]

**Why It Matters:**
Without this, we can't proceed with [next phase], which puts your [go-live date / milestone] at risk.

**Current Impact:**
If we don't receive [item] by [date], your go-live will shift from [original date] to [new date].

**Let's Connect:**
I want to make sure there are no blockers on your end. Can we hop on a quick call to discuss? [Calendly Link]

Or, if you need more time or have other priorities right now, let's adjust the timeline together so we can plan accordingly.

[Your Name]
