## Developer Qualification Process

### Stage 1: Initial Filter (5 minutes)
```markdown
## Quick Disqualifiers
- [ ] No similar project shown → REJECT
- [ ] Rate above budget → REJECT
- [ ] Not available immediately → REJECT
- [ ] Poor communication → REJECT
- [ ] No working examples → REJECT

## Quick Qualifiers
- [ ] Has exact experience → PROCEED
- [ ] Rate within range → PROCEED
- [ ] Available now → PROCEED
- [ ] Clear communication → PROCEED
- [ ] Shows working demos → PROCEED
```

### Stage 2: Technical Validation (15 minutes)

**The 5-Question Technical Screen**
1. "Walk me through how you built [similar project]"
2. "What was the biggest technical challenge?"
3. "How did you handle [specific requirement]?"
4. "What would you do differently?"
5. "How long did it actually take?"

**Red Flags**

- 🚩 Avoids technical details

### Stage 3: Reference Check (10 minutes)

**Quick Reference Template**
```
"Hi [Reference],
[Developer] listed you as a reference for a [project type] they built.
Three quick questions:
1. Did they deliver on time?
2. Was the code quality good?
3. Would you hire them again?
Thanks!"
```

## The Build vs Buy vs Hire Decision Tree

```
Is this a solved problem with existing solution?
├─YES→ BUY/LICENSE (cheapest)
└─NO→ Have we built this before?
      ├─YES→ USE INTERNAL SYSTEM (modify as needed)
      └─NO→ Is this our core competency?
            ├─YES→ BUILD INTERNALLY (strategic investment)
            └─NO→ HIRE DEVELOPER (optimal margin)
```

2. One chance to fix
3. Bring in senior developer to assist
4. Take over if not resolved
5. Partial payment only

### Timeline Slipping
1. Daily check-ins
2. Reduce scope if needed
3. Bring in additional help
4. Set hard deadline
5. Financial penalty if missed
