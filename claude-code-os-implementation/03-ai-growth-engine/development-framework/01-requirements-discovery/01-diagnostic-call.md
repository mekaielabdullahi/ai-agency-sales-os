## Pre-Call Preparation (5 minutes)

### Information to Gather
- [ ] Business name and industry
- [ ] Contact's role and decision authority
- [ ] Initial problem statement
- [ ] Budget range (if available)
- [ ] Timeline urgency

### Setup
- [ ] Calendar link sent
- [ ] Billing expectation set ($500/hour)
- [ ] Screen recording ready
- [ ] VS Code / development environment ready for vibe coding

---

## Call Structure (45-60 minutes)

### 1. Opening & Framing (5 minutes)
```
"This is a billable diagnostic session at $500/hour where we'll:
1. Diagnose your specific problem
2. Identify potential solutions
3. If appropriate, create a quick prototype
4. Determine next steps and rough costs"
```

### 2. Problem Discovery (15 minutes)

**Current State Questions:**
- What's the manual process today?
- How many people/hours does this take?
- What tools are you currently using?
- What's the biggest pain point?

**Impact Questions:**
- What's the cost of NOT solving this?
- How much time/money would this save?
- Who else has this problem in your organization?
- What's prevented you from solving this before?

**Technical Questions:**
- What systems need to integrate?
- What data do you work with?
- What's your tech stack?
- Any compliance/security requirements?

### 3. Solution Exploration (10 minutes)

**Pattern Recognition:**
- [ ] Have we built something similar?
- [ ] Is this a common pattern (automation, integration, dashboard)?
- [ ] Complexity assessment (simple/medium/complex)

**Approach Options:**
- **Option A**: Quick automation (1-2 weeks)
- **Option B**: Custom integration (2-4 weeks)
- **Option C**: Full system (4-8 weeks)

### 4. Live Prototype (15 minutes)

**When to Vibe Code:**
- Complex logic needs validation
- Visual interface demonstration
- API integration feasibility
- Client needs to "see it to believe it"

**Vibe Code Process:**
```python
# 1. Create simple structure
# 2. Mock the core functionality
# 3. Show the key interaction
# 4. Demonstrate the value
# Example: Simple invoice parser, API connection, UI mockup
```

### 5. Pricing & Next Steps (10 minutes)

**Rough Pricing Framework:**
| Complexity | Discovery | Build | Total |
|------------|-----------|-------|-------|
| Simple | $1-2k | $3-8k | $4-10k |
| Medium | $2-3k | $8-20k | $10-23k |
| Complex | $3-5k | $20-50k | $23-55k |

**Next Steps:**
1. **Immediate**: Send recording + prototype + rough estimate
2. **24 hours**: Refined proposal with milestones
3. **Decision**: Move to paid discovery phase

## Common Patterns & Solutions

### Pattern 1: Data Integration
**Problem**: Multiple systems don't talk
**Solution**: API middleware + sync engine
**Typical Cost**: $10-20k

### Pattern 2: Process Automation
**Problem**: Manual repetitive tasks
**Solution**: Workflow automation + triggers
**Typical Cost**: $5-15k

### Pattern 3: Reporting Dashboard
**Problem**: No visibility into metrics
**Solution**: Data pipeline + visualization
**Typical Cost**: $8-18k

### Pattern 4: Customer Portal
**Problem**: No self-service options
**Solution**: Web app + authentication
**Typical Cost**: $15-30k

## Objection Handling

### "That's more than I expected"
"Let's break it into phases. We can start with a $2k discovery to validate the approach and get you a working prototype."

### "I need to think about it"
"Absolutely. I'll send you the recording and prototype. When would be a good time to revisit?"

### "Can you just give me a quote?"
"I could, but it wouldn't be accurate. The diagnostic ensures we quote the right solution."

### "We tried this before and it failed"
"What specifically went wrong? Our phased approach ensures we validate before major investment."
