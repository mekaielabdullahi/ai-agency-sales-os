# AI Agency Development Framework

## Purpose
Systematize software delivery to achieve predictable, high-quality results with optimal margins while building reusable systems for each project type.

## Core Philosophy
- **Vibe Code First**: Rapid prototype to validate before committing resources
- **Phase-Gate Delivery**: Money in before major development
- **System Creation**: Every project creates a reusable system
- **Margin Protection**: Internal cost evaluation before client pricing
- **Quality Gates**: Internal validation before client delivery

## The 4-Phase Delivery System

```
PHASE 1: REQUIREMENTS & DISCOVERY ($500-2000)
├── Initial diagnostic call (billable)
├── Vibe code prototype
├── Requirements refinement
└── → Initial payment gate

PHASE 2: SOLUTION DESIGN
├── Developer sourcing OR internal solution
├── Architecture & approach
├── Phased milestones & pricing
└── → Contract & deposit gate

PHASE 3: DEVELOPMENT EXECUTION
├── Environment setup (dev/staging)
├── Milestone-based development
├── Continuous validation
└── → Per-milestone payment gates

PHASE 4: QUALITY & DELIVERY
├── Internal QA testing
├── Error handling verification
├── Logging & monitoring setup
├── Client review & handover
└── → Final payment & delivery
```

## Key Systems

### 1. Requirements System (`01-requirements-discovery/`)
- **Diagnostic call framework** - Structured discovery process
- **Prototype iteration cycle** - Fast validation loops
- **Requirements documentation** - Clear scope definition
- **Initial pricing model** - Discovery to commitment

### 2. Solution Design System (`02-solution-design/`)
- **Developer sourcing** - Network posting templates
- **Developer qualification** - Quality bar standards
- **Cost evaluation** - Internal pricing validation
- **Milestone planning** - Phased delivery approach

### 3. Development Execution System (`03-development-execution/`)
- **Environment management** - Dev/staging/prod separation
- **Progress tracking** - Milestone validation
- **Communication protocol** - Minimize back-and-forth
- **Change management** - Scope creep prevention

### 4. Quality & Delivery System (`04-quality-delivery/`)
- **QA testing protocol** - Internal quality gates
- **Error handling standards** - Robust failure management
- **Monitoring setup** - Operational visibility
- **Handover process** - Clean transfer & documentation

## Process Flow

```
1. LEAD COMES IN
   ↓
2. DIAGNOSTIC CALL ($500)
   - Understand problem
   - Identify solution type
   - Vibe code if needed
   ↓
3. REQUIREMENTS REFINEMENT
   - Iterate prototype
   - Document scope
   - Get initial buy-in
   ↓
4. CHECK: BUILT BEFORE?
   ├─YES→ Use existing system
   └─NO→ Source developers
   ↓
5. DEVELOPER SOURCING
   - Post to network
   - Qualify candidates
   - Evaluate costs
   ↓
6. SOLUTION DESIGN
   - Architecture approach
   - Milestone breakdown
   - Internal cost review
   ↓
7. CLIENT PRICING
   - Dev cost
   - + Architect margin (30-50%)
   - + Sales fee (10-20%)
   - = Client price
   ↓
8. DEVELOPMENT
   - Setup environments
   - Execute milestones
   - Validate progress
   ↓
9. QUALITY GATES
   - Internal testing
   - Error handling
   - Monitoring setup
   ↓
10. DELIVERY
    - Client review
    - Collect payment
    - Transfer ownership
    ↓
11. SYSTEM CREATION
    - Document what worked
    - Create templates
    - Refine for next time
```

## Financial Model

| Component | Range | Notes |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| Diagnostic Call | $500-2000 | Always billable |
| Prototype Phase | $1000-5000 | Validates approach |
| Development | Variable | Based on complexity |
| Architect Margin | 30-50% | On dev costs |
| Sales Fee | 10-20% | To Linh/Mikael |
| Target Project Size | $5k-50k | Sweet spot |

## Quality Standards

### Non-Negotiables
- [ ] Error handling in place
- [ ] Logging configured
- [ ] Monitoring accessible
- [ ] Staging environment tested
- [ ] Documentation provided
- [ ] Handover checklist complete

### Developer Quality Bar
- [ ] Has built similar before
- [ ] Can show working examples
- [ ] Understands our standards
- [ ] Communicates clearly
- [ ] Delivers on time

---

## Efficiency Drivers

1. **Template Everything**: Standard posts, contracts, checklists
2. **Eliminate Back-and-Forth**: Anticipate questions, provide context upfront
3. **Parallel Processing**: Multiple developers, multiple projects
4. **System Reuse**: Second time is 50% faster, third time is automated
5. **Clear Gates**: No work without payment, no delivery without quality

---

## Success Metrics

| Metric | Target | Current |
|--------|--------|---------|
| Diagnostic to Contract | <7 days | - |
| Contract to Delivery | <30 days | - |
| Gross Margin | >40% | - |
| Client Satisfaction | >90% | - |
| System Reuse Rate | >30% | - |

## Internal Development OS (NEW)

For internal product development and vibe coding, see **[INTERNAL-DEVELOPMENT-OS.md](./INTERNAL-DEVELOPMENT-OS.md)** which integrates:

- **AutoClaude** - Autonomous execution with self-validating QA loops
- **BMAD Method** - Spec-driven development with 19 specialized AI agents
- **Testing & Metrics** - Built-in quality gates and instrumentation

Use this when YOU are building (prototypes, internal tools, vibe coding) rather than delegating to developers.

---

## Next Actions

1. Create detailed process documents for each phase
2. Build template library for common tasks
3. Establish developer network and qualification process
4. Document first 3 projects to create initial systems
5. Set up tracking for metrics and continuous improvement
6. ~~Integrate AutoClaude + BMAD into development workflow~~ ✅ DONE

## The Golden Rule

**Every project makes the next one easier.**
Build the system while building the solution.
Document what works, eliminate what doesn't.
Scale through systems, not hours.
