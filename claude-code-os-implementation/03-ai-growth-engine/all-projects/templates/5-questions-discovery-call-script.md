## OPENING (2-3 min)

### Transition from Small Talk

> "Thanks for taking the time today. I've got about 30 minutes blocked off - I want to make sure this is valuable for you, so let me tell you what we'll cover."

### Set the Agenda

> "I'm going to ask you 5 questions to really understand your business and what's going on. If this is a good fit, we'll talk about next steps. If not, I'll point you in the right direction. Sound good?"

**Wait for confirmation.** Then:

> "Before we dive in, give me the 30-second version - what does [Company Name] do?"

📝 **Capture:**
- Company description (their words)
- Team size
- Primary offer/service

---

## Q1: THE BIGGEST PROBLEM (5-7 min)

### Primary Ask

> "Alright, let's get into it. What's the **biggest problem** in your business right now?"

### If They Give Multiple Problems

> "Those all sound painful. But if you could only fix ONE - the thing that's hurting the most - which would it be?"

### Drill-Down Questions

| If they say... | Ask... |
|----------------|--------|
| Vague complaint | "Can you give me a specific example of when this happened?" |
| People problem | "Walk me through what happens when [problem] occurs" |
| "We're fine" | "What would need to break for you to feel like you HAD to fix something?" |
| Process issue | "How many people are involved in this? How often?" |

### Listen For (Write These Down)

- [ ] Specific, quantifiable details
- [ ] Who is affected
- [ ] Frequency (daily, weekly, etc.)
- [ ] Downstream effects

### Red Flag Check

⚠️ **If they can't prioritize after 2 attempts** → May not have real pain or readiness to buy

### Good Answer Example

> "Our biggest problem is client coordination. We have 15 enterprise clients and 8 coordinators spending 60+ hours per week just on phone calls and spreadsheet updates to track project timelines. It's creating bottlenecks and we're losing clients because of slow response times."

📝 **Write their answer verbatim - use their words, not yours**

---

## Q2: THE COST (3-5 min)

### Primary Ask

> "Okay, so [restate problem in their words]. **How much is that costing you per month?**"

### If They Can't Quantify

> "Let me help you break it down..."

**Time Cost Calculator:**
> "How many people work on this? [X people]
> How many hours per week each? [Y hours]
> What do you pay them hourly, roughly? [$Z/hr]
> So that's [X × Y × Z × 4] = $____ per month just in labor."

**Lost Revenue Calculator:**
> "How many [customers/deals/projects] do you lose or miss because of this?"
> "What's each one worth?"
> "So that's $____ per month in lost revenue."

### The Magic Number

**Total Monthly Pain = Time Cost + Lost Revenue + Extra Costs**

📝 **CRITICAL: Get a specific number. Write it down.**

> Your project fee should be 30-50% of their monthly pain cost.

### Quick Math Reference

| Monthly Pain | Your Fee Range |
|--------------|----------------|
| $10K/month | $3K-5K project |
| $25K/month | $7.5K-12.5K project |
| $50K/month | $15K-25K project |
| $100K/month | $30K-50K project |

---

## Q3: THE DURATION (2-3 min)

### Primary Ask

> "How long have you had this problem?"

### Follow-Up Questions

| Duration | Ask... |
|----------|--------|
| < 3 months | "What changed recently that created this?" |
| 6-12 months | "What have you tried so far to fix it?" |
| > 1 year | "Why hasn't this been solved yet?" |

### Listen For

- [ ] What they've already tried (failed solutions = opportunity)
- [ ] Why those didn't work (prerequisites they're missing)
- [ ] Tipping point (what made them take this call NOW)

### Key Insight Question

> "What made you finally decide to look for a solution now?"

📝 **This reveals their urgency level and buying trigger**

---

## Q4: THE COST OF INACTION (3-5 min)

### Primary Ask

> "If you do nothing about this - if we don't talk again and you just keep going as is - **what does the next 6 to 12 months look like?**"

### Let Them Talk

**Silence is powerful here.** Let them paint the picture.

### Prompt If Needed

> "Walk me through it - what happens to the team? To revenue? To your capacity to grow?"

### Categories to Explore

| Area | Prompt |
|------|--------|
| Financial | "What's that costing you over 6 months total?" |
| Team | "What happens to your team's morale? Burnout?" |
| Competitive | "What are your competitors doing while you're stuck on this?" |
| Growth | "What opportunities will you miss?" |

### The Positioning Statement

Once they've described the pain, summarize it back:

> "So if we do nothing, in 6 months you're looking at [$ cost], probably [consequence], and [team/growth impact]. That's the alternative to investing [estimated fee] now to fix this permanently."

📝 **This creates urgency without being pushy - they told YOU the stakes**

---

## Q5: THE MAGIC WAND (5-7 min)

### Primary Ask

> "Last question. If I had a magic wand and could build the **perfect solution** to fix this problem, what would that look like?"

### Let Them Dream

Don't interrupt. Let them describe their vision completely.

### Clarifying Questions

> "What would 'fixed' look like day-to-day?"
> "How would you know it was working?"
> "Who would use this? How often?"

### Listen For Three Things

1. **Their Vision** - What they think they want
2. **Success Metrics** - How they'll measure success
3. **Gaps** - What they're overlooking (this is YOUR value-add)

### The CPO Pivot

After they describe their vision:

> "I love that vision. Here's what I'm thinking..."

**Phase 1 - The Foundation:**
> "Before we can build [their vision], we need to get [prerequisite] in place. Without that, it'll fail like [their previous attempts]. This takes [timeframe]."

**Phase 2 - The Transformation:**
> "Once that foundation is solid, we build [the thing they actually want]. That's when you see [the results they described]."

### Why This Works

- Shows you understand their vision
- Positions you as strategic partner (not order-taker)
- Addresses why previous attempts failed
- Creates a logical, phased approach

📝 **Write down both their vision AND the prerequisites they're missing**

---

## CLOSE (3-5 min)

### Recap Their Pain

> "Let me make sure I've got this right. Your biggest problem is [Q1]. It's costing you about [Q2] per month. You've been dealing with this for [Q3], and if you don't fix it, [Q4]. What you really want is [Q5]."

### Qualify the Fit

> "Based on what you've shared, I think there's a real opportunity here. Let me tell you what working with us looks like..."

### If It's a Fit - Book Next Step

> "The next step would be a [Roadmap Call / Audit Session] where I come back with a specific plan for your situation. That's [duration] and I'll show you exactly what we'd build, timeline, and investment. Can we get that on the calendar?"

### Handle Timing

| If they say... | Respond... |
|----------------|------------|
| "Send me info" | "Happy to - what specifically would be most helpful? And let's at least pencil in a time so it doesn't slip through the cracks." |
| "I need to think" | "Totally understand. What specifically do you need to think through? Let's address it now if we can." |
| "Talk to partner" | "Great - what do you think their main concern will be? Should we loop them in on the next call?" |

### Book the Call

> "I've got [Day] at [Time] or [Day] at [Time] - which works better?"

📝 **Get it on the calendar before you hang up**
