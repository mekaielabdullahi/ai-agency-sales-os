## What We Need From You

Your success is our success. To deliver the best possible outcome, here's what we'll need from you:

### 1. Timely Responses ⏰
When we reach out with questions or for approvals, please respond within 24-48 hours. This keeps us on schedule.

**Why it matters:** Delays in responses compound quickly and can push your go-live date back weeks.

---

### 2. System Access 🔑
We'll need access to your CRM, website, email platform, and other tools we're integrating.

**What we'll send:** A secure access collection request within 48 hours.
**What you'll need to do:** Provide credentials via our encrypted portal (5-10 minutes).
**Timeline:** Please provide access within 48 hours of our request.

---

### 3. Process Clarity 📋
The clearer you are about your workflows, the better we can automate them.

**What helps:** Screenshots, process documents, Loom videos of your current workflow.
**What doesn't help:** "Just figure it out" or "Do whatever you think is best."

---

### 4. Honest Feedback 💬
If something isn't right, tell us immediately. If you love something, tell us that too.

**We want to know:** What's working, what's not, what you're concerned about.

---

### 5. Attendance at Key Calls 📞
We have 4 critical calls during the project. Your presence is required:

1. **Kickoff Call** (Week 1) - 60 minutes
2. **Architecture Review** (Week 2) - 30 minutes
3. **Training Session** (Week 5-6) - 2 hours
4. **Go-Live Call** (Week 6) - 30 minutes

**Please prioritize these.** Missing these calls delays the project.

---

### 6. Patience & Trust 🤝
Good automation takes time to build right. Trust the process, trust our expertise.

**What to expect:** Weeks 3-5 will feel quiet—that's when we're building. You'll see results in Week 5-6.
