## Gamma Prompt (Copy & Paste Into Gamma)

```
Create a concise, modern presentation for AriseGroup.ai — an AI transformation consulting agency. This deck is used during discovery calls with business owners who are exploring AI but don't know who we are yet. Keep it warm, confident, and jargon-free. Use a clean, premium aesthetic with warm amber/gold accents on deep navy backgrounds. No stock photos — use icons or abstract visuals only.

Slide 1 — Title
AriseGroup.ai
"From Ad-Hoc to Systematic AI Adoption"
Subtext: Your AI strategy, engineering, and adoption partner.

---

Slide 2 — The Problem
Headline: "AI Is Everywhere. Clarity Isn't."
Three short bullet points:
- You know AI can help your business, but you don't know where to start
- You've tried tools here and there — nothing sticks or scales
- Your best people are buried in manual work that should be automated
End with: "You don't have an AI problem. You have an adoption problem."

---

Slide 3 — Who We Are
Headline: "We Make AI Adoption Systematic"
AriseGroup.ai is an AI transformation consulting firm. We help companies with 20-500 employees replace ad-hoc AI experiments with a structured, phased approach that actually delivers ROI. We're not a tool vendor — we're strategic partners who diagnose first, then build.
Three pillars (show as 3 columns):
1. AI Strategy & Audits — Map your operations, find the highest-impact AI opportunities, build a phased roadmap
2. Automation & Development — Custom workflows, integrations, and AI systems built for your specific business
3. Training & Adoption — Get your team confident and self-sufficient with AI, not dependent on us forever

---

Slide 4 — How We're Different
Headline: "Framework-First, Not Tool-First"
Four short differentiators (use icons):
1. We diagnose before we prescribe — Every engagement starts with understanding your business, not pitching software
2. Prerequisites before AI — 80% of AI success is getting your data, processes, and infrastructure right first
3. Phased roadmaps, not big-bang projects — 30, 90, and 180-day milestones so you see value fast
4. Partners, not vendors — We embed with your team and transfer knowledge so you're never dependent on us

---

Slide 5 — What We Do (Services)
Headline: "From Discovery to Delivery"
Show as a horizontal process flow with 4 steps:
Step 1: AI Readiness Audit — We map your business functions, score AI opportunities by impact and feasibility, and deliver a prioritized roadmap. (2 weeks)
Step 2: Quick-Win Sprint — We implement the highest-impact opportunity from your audit to prove value fast. (30 days)
Step 3: Strategic Implementation — We build out your AI systems across multiple business functions with full integration. (60-90 days)
Step 4: Retained Partnership — Ongoing optimization, new capability rollouts, and strategic advisory as your AI partner. (Monthly)

Slide 6 — Real Results
Headline: "From 35 Wasted Hours to 5 New Referrals in 7 Days"
Case study snapshot — Plotter Mechanix (printer service & repair, 3-person team):
- Problem: Owner was the only technician — business stopped when he was unavailable. 35+ hours/week lost to inefficient manual processes. $180K/year in wasted time.
- Solution: AI phone system with automatic transcription, call-to-CRM automation, and a knowledge capture system — deployed in 10 days.
- Result: "I don't have to make another phone call to explain what the first one was about." 5 new referrals within 7 days. New team members can now operate without constant hand-holding.

---

Slide 7 — Who We Work With
Headline: "Is This You?"
Four persona bullets:
- Business owners who know AI matters but need a clear starting point
- Operations leaders drowning in manual processes that should be automated
- Growing companies (20-500 people) where the founder is still the bottleneck
- Teams that tried ChatGPT or other tools but can't connect them to real business outcomes

---

Slide 8 — Let's Talk
Headline: "Your Next Step Is a Conversation"
Body: We start every relationship with a free 30-minute discovery call. No pitch, no pressure — just five honest questions about your business to see if we can help.
Call to action: "Book your discovery call at arisegroup.ai"
Subtext: "We'll listen first. Then we'll show you what's possible."
```

## Usage Notes

- **Gamma style tip**: After pasting, select "Professional" or "Minimal" theme in Gamma and override accent color to `#E8914F` (Warm Amber) with `#1A2B4A` (Deep Navy) backgrounds to match brand.
- **Presentation length**: 8 slides, ~5-7 minutes to walk through on a discovery call.
- **Flow logic**: Problem → Who we are → Differentiators → Services → Proof → Fit check → CTA. This mirrors the natural trust-building arc of a discovery conversation.

## How to Customize Per Prospect

1. **Slide 6 (Case Study)**: Swap the Plotter Mechanix example for a case study closer to the prospect's industry if available.
2. **Slide 7 (Who We Work With)**: Adjust the persona bullets to match the specific prospect's role and pain points discovered during pre-call research.
3. **Slide 2 (The Problem)**: If you know the prospect's specific pain point from outreach, lead with that instead of the generic bullets.
