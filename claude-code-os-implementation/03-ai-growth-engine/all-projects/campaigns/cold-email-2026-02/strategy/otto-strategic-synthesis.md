# Otto Peterson Strategic Synthesis
## Weekly Sync - Mekaiel Abdullahi & Otto Petersen

## The Core Insight

**Stop marketing to "anyone and everyone." Go deep on two verticals where you have proof.**

No other agencies are approaching printing companies with this specific solution. Kelsey is your proof that it works. Early to these avatars = competitive advantage. **Once saturated, this won't work -- move fast.**

## The Business Sequence

```
Lead Acquisition → Sales Conversion → Fulfillment/Operations
       ↑                                      ↑
  Most agencies                         YOU ARE HERE
  compete here                        (rare differentiator)
```

**Your advantage:** Target businesses that have steps 1 & 2 dialed in (leads coming in, sales converting) but are **bottlenecked at step 3** (fulfillment/operations).

**Result:** Shorter sales cycles, higher-ticket clients, proven ROI.

## The Two Verticals

### 1. Large Format Printer Companies (Kelsey/Plotter Mechanix Model)
- $800K revenue client
- 1,378% ROI case study
- Phase 1 complete, Phase 2 in progress
- Videos in production
- **Ready to scale immediately**

### 2. Homestead Businesses
- Solution already built and ready for deployment
- S&S Wolf Sheds (shed dealer, 3 AZ locations, targets "rural/semi-rural acreage owners, homesteaders") is the bridge deal
- Close Sandra -> deploy pre-built solution -> first homestead case study
- Maples Apothecary also in pipeline

| Conversion Rate | 5-10% | 30-50%+ |
| Time Investment | High (broad activities) | Lower (focused outreach) |
| Revenue Potential | Unpredictable | Predictable & scalable |

## Discovery Call Adjustments (Hormozi + Otto)

### Printing Prospects (Lead with Proof, Phase the Close)
> "Before we start -- I researched [Company]. I noticed [specific]. Tell me more about that... You sound a lot like Kelsey at Plotter Mechanix. Here's what we built and what happened [1,378% ROI, 15 hrs/week saved]. Here's how I'd adapt it for you."

**Pricing approach (per Otto):** Establish budget upfront ("What are you comfortable investing to solve this?"). Don't pitch the full $15-42K. Start with $5K Phase 1 milestone. Let results sell Phase 2.

### Homestead Prospects (Lead with Empathy, Ultra-Low Barrier)
> "Before we start -- I looked at [Company/Brand]. [Specific compliment about what they've built]. I want to understand what your day actually looks like... Where are you losing time that has nothing to do with [their craft]?"

**Pricing approach (per Otto):** $500 audit + $2,000 first deliverable. Solution is pre-built -- you're deploying, not building from scratch. Frame it: "I've already built the system for a similar business. I just need to customize it for you."
