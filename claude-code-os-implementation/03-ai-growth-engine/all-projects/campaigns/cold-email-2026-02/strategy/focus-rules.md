# Focus Rules
## DO/DON'T Guardrails for Cold Email Campaign

---

## DO

- [ ] Focus exclusively on printing and homestead verticals
- [ ] Use Kelsey's case study in every pitch
- [ ] Send cold emails to 20-50 similar businesses immediately
- [ ] Track responses and refine messaging
- [ ] Build case studies from new clients quickly
- [ ] Scale what works
- [ ] Respond to positive replies within 1 hour
- [ ] Log ICP data from every positive reply
- [ ] Review metrics every Monday at 8am
- [ ] Brief the team on both verticals and the Kelsey case study

---

## DON'T

- [ ] Pursue the mini audit offering (separate vertical -- too diluted)
- [ ] Continue broad door knocking without vertical focus
- [ ] Spread energy across 5+ different business types
- [ ] Launch new initiatives without tying to lead gen or sales conversion
- [ ] Wait for perfect case studies before reaching out
- [ ] Pitch the full $15-42K engagement on the first call
- [ ] Skip the warmup period for new inboxes
- [ ] Send more than 30 emails per inbox per day
- [ ] Ignore bounce rates (pause inbox if >5%)
- [ ] Contact negative replies ever again

## Decision Filter

When a new opportunity or idea comes up, ask:

1. **Is it in the printing or homestead vertical?**
   - No -> Park it. Don't pursue.
   - Yes -> Continue.

2. **Does it move cold email forward?**
   - No -> Is it a warm lead close? If yes, pursue. If no, park it.
   - Yes -> Continue.

3. **Can I tie it to an existing case study or proof point?**
   - No -> Can I get a case study from it within 30 days? If yes, consider. If no, park it.
   - Yes -> Execute.

## Exceptions

The only exception to vertical focus is **closing existing warm leads** (the 11 leads in the tracker). These are already in pipeline and represent immediate revenue. Work them in parallel with cold email infrastructure setup.

## Weekly Self-Check

Every Friday, ask:
1. Did I spend >80% of outreach time on printing/homestead? If no, course correct.
2. Did I reference the Kelsey case study in every pitch? If no, why not?
3. Did I add new leads to the pipeline this week? How many?
4. Did I follow up on every positive reply within 1 hour?
5. Am I tempted to start something new? If yes, apply the decision filter above.
