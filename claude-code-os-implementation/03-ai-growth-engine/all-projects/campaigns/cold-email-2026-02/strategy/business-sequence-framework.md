# Business Sequence Framework
## Lead Acquisition -> Sales Conversion -> Fulfillment/Operations

---

## The Framework

Every business operates across three stages:

```
┌──────────────────┐    ┌──────────────────┐    ┌──────────────────┐
│  LEAD ACQUISITION │───>│ SALES CONVERSION  │───>│   FULFILLMENT /  │
│                  │    │                  │    │   OPERATIONS     │
│  - Marketing     │    │  - Proposals     │    │  - Delivery      │
│  - Advertising   │    │  - Closing       │    │  - Admin         │
│  - Content       │    │  - Follow-up     │    │  - Scheduling    │
│  - Referrals     │    │  - Negotiation   │    │  - Processing    │
└──────────────────┘    └──────────────────┘    └──────────────────┘
        ↑                                              ↑
   Most agencies                                 YOU ARE HERE
   compete here                               (rare differentiator)
```

## Why This Positioning Wins

### Most Agencies Sell Lead Gen
- Crowded market
- Prospects are skeptical (burned by previous agencies)
- ROI is hard to prove
- Long sales cycles (3-6 months)

### We Sell Operational Efficiency
- Almost no competition at this stage
- Prospects feel the pain daily (they're drowning)
- ROI is immediate and measurable (hours saved, costs reduced)
- Short sales cycles (4-8 weeks)

---

## The Ideal Target

Businesses where:
- **Step 1 is working:** Leads are coming in
- **Step 2 is working:** Sales are converting
- **Step 3 is the bottleneck:** Fulfillment/operations can't keep up

These businesses don't need more leads. They need to handle the leads they already have without the owner being the bottleneck.

## Applied to Our Verticals

### Printing Companies
- **Step 1:** Reputation-based referrals drive calls (working)
- **Step 2:** Owner closes deals because they're the expert (working)
- **Step 3:** Owner is also the only tech, scheduler, dispatcher, and admin (**bottleneck**)
- **Our solution:** Automate call routing, ticket creation, dispatch, follow-up

### Homestead Businesses
- **Step 1:** Content/social media drives audience (working)
- **Step 2:** Products sell through website/Etsy/social (working)
- **Step 3:** Owner manually processes every order, email, DM, inventory update (**bottleneck**)
- **Our solution:** Automate order processing, customer follow-up, inventory tracking

## Conversation Framework

When talking to prospects, map their business to this sequence:

1. "How are your leads coming in?" (Confirm Step 1 is working)
2. "How are you converting those into sales?" (Confirm Step 2 is working)
3. "Once someone becomes a customer, what happens next?" (Find the Step 3 bottleneck)
4. "How many hours a week do you spend on that operational side?" (Quantify the pain)
5. "What would you do with those hours back?" (Paint the future)

## Pricing Alignment

| Stage | Offer | Price |
|-------|-------|-------|
| Entry | Operations audit | $500 (homestead) / Free (printing, proof-led) |
| Phase 1 | Build one automation | $2K (homestead) / $5K (printing) |
| Phase 2 | Full operational system | $5-10K (homestead) / $15-42K (printing) |
| Ongoing | Maintenance + expansion | Monthly retainer |

The key: **Start small, prove ROI, then expand.** Let results sell the next phase.
