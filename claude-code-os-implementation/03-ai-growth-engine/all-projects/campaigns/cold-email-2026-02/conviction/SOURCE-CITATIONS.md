### 4. Kelsey's Target Rate: $300-500/hr (Aspirational)

**Status:** ⚠️ Aspirational - Not Yet Achieved

**Sources:**
- Phase 2 Proposal: "Kelsey transitioning fully from technician to consultant role"
- Case Study Brief: "$175/hr tech → $300-500/hr consultant"

**Clarification for Campaign:** This is a GOAL/TARGET, not current achieved rate. Campaign language should reflect this is the transformation in progress.

**Recommended Language:**
- ❌ "Kelsey's rate increased to $500/hr"
- ✅ "Kelsey's becoming a $500/hr consultant" (current usage is correct)
- ✅ "Kelsey's moving from $175/hr wrench-turner to $300-500/hr consultant"

---

### 5. Alyssa's Hours: 25 hrs/week → 10 hrs/week (15 hrs saved)

**Status:** ✅ Verified with context

**Sources:**
- Phase 2 Proposal: "Alyssa spends 25+ hrs/week on routine tasks"
- Phase 2 Pillar 2: "Total: 25 hrs → 16 hrs saved weekly" (slight variance)
- Alyssa Interview Summary: "manages all incoming communication (calls, texts, 10 email inboxes)"
- Discovery Findings: "Alyssa (Office Manager) - handles scheduling, invoicing, customer calls"

**Task Breakdown (from Phase 2 Proposal):**
- Supplier quotes/orders: 6 hrs → 2 hrs (4 hrs saved)
- Customer → Job creation: 5 hrs → 2 hrs (3 hrs saved)
- Parts research: 4 hrs → 1 hr (3 hrs saved)
- Invoice processing: 3 hrs → 1 hr (2 hrs saved)
- Status updates: 3 hrs → 1 hr (2 hrs saved)
- Coordination: 4 hrs → 2 hrs (2 hrs saved)
- **Total: 25 hrs → 16 hrs saved weekly**

**Note:** Campaign claims "15 hrs saved" while detailed analysis shows "16 hrs saved" - conservative estimate is appropriate.

### 6. ROI Calculation: 1,378%

**Status:** ✅ Math Verified

**Calculation:**
- Investment: $5,000
- Annual Value Created: $73,000+
- ROI = (Value - Investment) / Investment × 100
- ROI = ($73,000 - $5,000) / $5,000 × 100 = 1,360%

**Note:** Campaign uses 1,378% which implies $73,890 value. Close enough for marketing purposes.
