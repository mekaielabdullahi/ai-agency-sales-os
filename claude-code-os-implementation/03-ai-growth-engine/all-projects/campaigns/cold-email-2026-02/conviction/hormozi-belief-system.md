# Hormozi Belief System
## Conviction Meetings, Scoring, Time Travel Test

---

## Core Principle

**Conviction > Skill.** If you believe with certainty that your solution transforms a prospect's business, you will follow up with appropriate intensity. If you doubt it, you'll give up after 2 emails.

## Weekly Team Conviction Meeting (30 min, Monday Mornings)

### Block 1: Case Study Deep-Dive (10 min)

| Week | Case Study | Conviction Line |
|------|-----------|----------------|
| 1 | Plotter Mechanix Phase 1 | "1,378% ROI. Alyssa got 15 hrs back. Kelsey's becoming a $500/hr consultant." |
| 2 | Plotter Mechanix (Alyssa's story) | "She was drowning in 25 hrs/week of comms processing. Now the system handles it." |
| 3 | Plotter Mechanix Phase 2 | "$800K company scaling to $1.5M with AI-powered quoting and dispatch automation." |
| 4 | Plotter Mechanix (Kelsey's transformation) | "From $175/hr technician to $500/hr consultant. The business runs without her on the phones." |

**Rotation:** After Week 4, loop back. Add new printing case studies as they're created.

**How to run the deep-dive:**
1. Pick one team member to present the case study (5 min)
2. Focus on: Before state, intervention, after state, specific metrics
3. Everyone asks: "Could we replicate this for [prospect X]?"
4. End with the conviction line -- say it out loud as a team

### Block 2: Prospect Problem Training (10 min)

Pick one prospect from the pipeline. Answer these 5 questions as a team:

1. **What does their Tuesday look like?**
   - Walk through their actual day. Calls, quotes, dispatch, admin, service work.
   - Make it specific -- "At 9am, the phone rings. Kelsey picks up because Alyssa is already on another call..."

2. **Where are they losing time/money/sanity?**
   - Identify the exact bottleneck
   - Quantify it: hours, dollars, missed opportunities

3. **What have they tried before?**
   - Hired someone? Bought software? Did nothing?
   - Why didn't previous attempts work?

4. **What does life look like 6 months after we fix this?**
   - Paint the picture. Be specific.
   - "Kelsey isn't answering the phone anymore. She's writing proposals at $500/hr."

5. **Time Travel Test:** If we KNEW -- with absolute certainty -- that our solution works for this prospect, how many times would we follow up?
   - Answer: A lot. Because we'd be doing them a disservice by NOT following up.
   - This is the conviction that drives appropriate follow-up intensity.

### Block 3: 5 Questions Role Play (10 min)

One person plays the prospect, one plays Mekaiel. Run through the discovery call.

**Focus areas:**
- **Q2 (Quantifying cost):** "How many hours per week does this cost you?" Practice getting specific numbers.
- **Q4 (Cost of inaction):** "If nothing changes in 12 months, what happens?" Practice letting the prospect feel the weight of their own answer.

## Follow-Up Conviction Scoring

After every interaction (positive reply, discovery call, proposal), assign a conviction score:

| Score | Meaning | Follow-Up Cadence | Max Touches |
|-------|---------|-------------------|-------------|
| 9-10 | "I KNOW we transform this business" | Every 3-4 days | 12 |
| 7-8 | "Very likely we help significantly" | Every 5-7 days | 8 |
| 5-6 | "Probably can help" | Every 7-10 days | 5 |
| 1-4 | "Not sure it's a fit" | -- | 3, then archive |

### How to Score

Ask yourself:
1. Does this prospect look like Kelsey/Plotter Mechanix? (Similar size, pain, structure)
2. Do they have the operational bottleneck we solve?
3. Can I visualize what their business looks like after we help?
4. Would they see measurable results within 30 days?

If yes to all 4: Score 9-10.
If yes to 3: Score 7-8.
If yes to 2: Score 5-6.
If yes to 1 or 0: Score 1-4.

## The Time Travel Test

Before every follow-up email or call, ask:

> "If a time traveler told me that this prospect becomes our next $50K client and their business transforms because of our work... would I send this follow-up?"

The answer is always yes. The follow-up isn't annoying -- it's a service.

**But:** If you genuinely don't believe you can help them (score 1-4), stop following up. Don't waste their time or yours.

## Common Conviction Killers (And How to Fix Them)

| Killer | Fix |
|--------|-----|
| "They haven't replied, they must not be interested" | Most people are busy, not uninterested. Follow up per conviction score. |
| "I don't want to be annoying" | Time Travel Test. If you know it works, following up is a service. |
| "Maybe our solution isn't good enough" | Re-read the Plotter Mechanix metrics. 1,378% ROI. It works. (Source: [SOURCE-CITATIONS.md](./SOURCE-CITATIONS.md)) |
| "This prospect is too small/big for us" | If they match the ICP, they're a fit. Plotter Mechanix = $850K revenue, 3 employees. Trust the profile. |
| "I should wait until I have more case studies" | One case study is enough to start. Kelsey is your proof. |
