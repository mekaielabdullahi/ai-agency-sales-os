## 4-Week Rotation

| Week | Case Study | Focus | Conviction Line |
|------|-----------|-------|----------------|
| **Week 1** | Plotter Mechanix Phase 1 | The numbers: ROI, hours saved, rate increase | "1,378% ROI. Alyssa got 15 hrs back. Kelsey's becoming a $500/hr consultant." |
| **Week 2** | Plotter Mechanix (Alyssa's Story) | The human impact: drowning in admin -> system handles it | "She was drowning in 25 hrs/week of comms processing. Now the system handles it." |
| **Week 3** | Plotter Mechanix Phase 2 | The scale-up: $800K to $1.5M with AI | "$800K company scaling to $1.5M with AI-powered quoting and dispatch automation." |
| **Week 4** | Plotter Mechanix (Kelsey's Transformation) | The owner transformation: tech to consultant | "From $175/hr technician to $500/hr consultant. The business runs without her on the phones." |

After Week 4, loop back to Week 1. Add new printing case studies as they're created.

## Deep-Dive Format (10 min)

### 1. Before State (3 min)
- What was the client's situation?
- What was the specific bottleneck?
- How much time/money was being lost?
- What had they tried before?

### 2. The Intervention (3 min)
- What exactly did we build?
- How long did it take?
- What was the investment?
- What was the client's experience during implementation?

### 3. After State (3 min)
- What are the measurable results?
- What does the client's day look like now?
- What future opportunities opened up?
- What's the client saying about it?

### 4. Team Exercise (1 min)
- "Could we replicate this for [specific prospect in pipeline]?"
- Say the conviction line out loud together.

## Adding New Case Studies

When a new case study is created, add it to the rotation:

1. Write the "Before / Intervention / After" summary
2. Create a conviction line (one powerful sentence)
3. Add to the rotation table above
4. File the full case study in `06-knowledge-base/case-studies/`
5. Update the email sequences if the new study adds proof to the printing vertical

### Priority for Next Case Studies
1. **Any new printing client** (compounds the Plotter Mechanix proof)
2. **New printing vertical wins** (document within 30 days of close)

> **Note:** S&S Wolf and other warm leads tracked separately in `warm-leads/outreach-tracker-2026-02.md`
