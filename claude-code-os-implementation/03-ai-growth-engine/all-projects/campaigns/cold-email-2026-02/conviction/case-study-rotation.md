## 4-Week Rotation

| Week | Case Study | Focus | Conviction Line |
|------|-----------|-------|----------------|
| **Week 1** | Plotter Mechanix Phase 1 | The numbers: ROI, hours saved, rate increase | "1,378% ROI. Alyssa got 15 hrs back. Kelsey's becoming a $500/hr consultant." |
| **Week 2** | Plotter Mechanix (Alyssa's Story) | The human impact: drowning in admin -> system handles it | "She was drowning in 25 hrs/week of comms processing. Now the system handles it." |
| **Week 3** | S&S Wolf Sheds | The bridge deal: zero to digital presence | "3-location shed dealer with zero digital presence. We're building their first lead capture system." |
| **Week 4** | The Homestead Opportunity | The market thesis: underserved vertical, first-mover advantage | "These businesses are underserved. The first case study here unlocks an entire vertical." |

After Week 4, loop back to Week 1. Add new case studies as they're created.

## Adding New Case Studies

When a new case study is created, add it to the rotation:

1. Write the "Before / Intervention / After" summary
2. Create a conviction line (one powerful sentence)
3. Add to the rotation table above
4. File the full case study in `06-knowledge-base/case-studies/`
5. Update the email sequences if the new study adds proof to the vertical

### Priority for Next Case Studies
1. **S&S Wolf Sheds** (first homestead case study -- unlocks entire vertical)
2. **Any new printing client** (compounds the Plotter Mechanix proof)
3. **Maples Apothecary** (adds homestead depth)
