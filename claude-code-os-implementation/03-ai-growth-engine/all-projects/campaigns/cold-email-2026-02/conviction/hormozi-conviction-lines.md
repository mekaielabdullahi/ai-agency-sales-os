# Hormozi Conviction Lines: Service Business Campaigns

## The Value Equation

**Value = (Dream Outcome × Likelihood of Achievement) / (Time Delay × Effort & Sacrifice)**

Every line in our campaigns must increase perceived value by:
1. Making the Dream Outcome more vivid and desirable
2. Increasing Likelihood through proof and specificity
3. Reducing perceived Time Delay (weeks, not months)
4. Minimizing Effort & Sacrifice (we do the work)

## The 3-Pillar Conviction Stack

**Use this structure in Email 3 to maximize Likelihood:**

### Pillar 1: CONSULTING (Diagnosis)
> "We don't touch technology until we understand your operation. We interviewed the owner, admin, and field tech separately. We mapped every touchpoint. We quantified the chaos hours. Then we delivered a complete PlotterOps Blueprint."

**Why it builds conviction:** Shows thorough, methodical approach. Not a template solution.

### Pillar 2: DEVELOPMENT (Custom Build)
> "We built custom AI systems for their specific workflow. Unified phone system. Smart call routing. AI transcription and summaries. CRM integration. After-hours AI assistant. All connected."

**Why it builds conviction:** Shows technical depth and customization.

### Pillar 3: EDUCATION (Ownership Transfer)
> "We trained their team live. Daily support on WhatsApp. Video walkthroughs. One-page SOPs. 30-day support period. They own the system - they don't depend on us forever."

**Why it builds conviction:** Addresses fear of dependency and abandonment.

## CTA Conviction Lines

### Workshop Invite (Low Commitment)
> "We're hosting a free online workshop on March 17th at 7 PM EST where we break down exactly how we diagnose operational chaos in service businesses - the same process we used with a Phoenix printer company to find 30 hours of weekly chaos hiding in plain sight."

### Diagnostic Conversation (Higher Intent)
> "If you want to see how we diagnosed a Phoenix service company's chaos, let's talk."

### Reply Trigger (Lowest Friction)
> "Reply with your biggest operational headache. I'll share what we built for a company with the same problem."

## Lines to AVOID (Anti-Conviction)

| Avoid | Why | Replace With |
|-------|-----|--------------|
| "Free discovery call" | Devalues expertise | "Diagnostic conversation" |
| "No obligation" | Implies high-pressure later | Focus on workshop value |
| "X% ROI" | Unproven, sounds like hype | Transformation descriptions |
| "Revolutionary" | Generic, meaningless | Specific proof mechanisms |
| "We're the best" | Arrogant, unprovable | Show, don't tell |
| "Act now" | Scarcity manipulation | Natural next step |
| "Limited spots" | Artificial urgency | Real event date |
