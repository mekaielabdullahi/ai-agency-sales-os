## Morning Ritual (8:00 - 8:30 AM)

This is the most important 30 minutes of the day.

### Step 1: Dashboard Check (10 min)
Open n8n dashboard and Google Sheet. Check:
- [ ] New replies overnight? (Positive, neutral, negative)
- [ ] Bounce rate still under 5%?
- [ ] Any inboxes paused?
- [ ] Emails sent yesterday on target?

### Step 2: Reply Responses (15-30 min)
For every positive reply:
1. Read the reply carefully
2. Respond within 1 hour of seeing it
3. Use the positive reply template (see `reply-handling.md`)
4. Book the discovery call
5. Update the Google Sheet

## Weekly Adjustments

### Monday
- 8:00 AM: Weekly metrics review (see `metrics-dashboard.md`)
- 8:30 AM: Team conviction meeting (see `conviction/hormozi-belief-system.md`)
- Then normal daily schedule

### Friday
- 4:00 PM: Weekly self-check (see `strategy/focus-rules.md`)
- Review week's numbers against targets
- Plan next week's lead sourcing

## Key Habits

1. **Never let a positive reply sit for more than 1 hour.** Speed = conversion.
2. **Add leads daily.** 10 per day minimum. Pipeline dries up fast.
3. **Log everything.** Every reply, every call, every outcome goes in the sheet.
4. **Don't context-switch.** Batch similar tasks (lead research, then emails, then calls).
5. **LinkedIn engagement is warm-up, not lead gen.** 20 min max. Don't get sucked in.
