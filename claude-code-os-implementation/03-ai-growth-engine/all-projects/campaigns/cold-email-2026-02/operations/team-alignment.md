## Questions for the Team

### 1. Printing Vertical
> Besides Kelsey, who else do we know in printing that could be a reference?

Notes: _________________

### 2. Homestead Vertical
> What specific pain points are we solving? Do we have metrics to share?

Notes: _________________

### 3. Cold Email Operations
> Who's sending the emails? What's our reply management process?

- Sending: Automated via n8n (Matthew builds)
- Reply management: Mekaiel monitors, responds within 1 hour for positives
- Escalation: If Mekaiel is unavailable, [backup person] monitors

Notes: _________________

### 4. Tracking
> How do we measure success? (Leads, meetings booked, deals closed)

- Google Sheet "Cold Outreach Tracker" (4 tabs)
- Weekly Monday 8am metrics review
- Key metrics: bounce rate, open rate, reply rate, positive reply %, calls booked, proposals sent, deals closed

Notes: _________________

## Education Strategy (Complementary)

**Primary lead gen = cold email to specific verticals.**
**Education = warm-up funnel + brand awareness.**

| Element | Details |
|---------|---------|
| Frequency | 2x per month |
| Content | Document agency journey, AI education, industry insights |
| Format | Eventbrite workshops |
| CTA | Invite to paid workshops specific to their industry |

**Example workflow:**
1. Free Eventbrite workshop: "How to Scale Your Printing Business with AI Operations"
2. Attendees see your process and results (Kelsey case study)
3. Offer: Paid workshop or audit for their specific business
4. This feeds into cold email campaign (attendees who don't convert = warm leads for follow-up)

> Education events are the warm-up. Cold email is the engine. Don't confuse the two.
