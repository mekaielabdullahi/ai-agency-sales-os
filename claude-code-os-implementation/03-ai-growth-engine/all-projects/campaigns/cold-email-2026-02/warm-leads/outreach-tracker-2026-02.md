## Notes

- These warm leads are the immediate revenue opportunity while cold email infrastructure is being built
- Work them from your MAIN domain (arisegroup.ai), not the cold email domains
- Sandra/S&S Wolf is the critical bridge deal -- closing her gives you the first homestead case study
- Don't let cold email setup distract from closing these warm leads
