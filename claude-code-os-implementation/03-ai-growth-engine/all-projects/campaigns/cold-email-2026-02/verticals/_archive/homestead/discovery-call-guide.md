## The 5 Discovery Questions (15 min)

### Q1: The Day
> "Walk me through a typical day. From when you start working to when you stop -- what does that look like?"

**Listen for:** How much time is spent on admin vs their craft. Where the day gets eaten.

### Q2: The Pain (Critical)
> "Where are you losing time that has nothing to do with [homesteading/your actual craft]?"

**Listen for:** Order processing, customer emails, DMs, inventory, shipping, scheduling. Specific tasks and hour counts.

### Q3: Previous Attempts
> "Have you tried to solve this before? Hired a VA, bought software, anything?"

**Listen for:** Tools tried (Etsy integrations, Zapier, VAs), what didn't work, why.

### Q4: Cost of Inaction (Critical)
> "If you keep doing it the way you're doing it now for another year, what happens?"

**Listen for:** Burnout, lost orders, can't launch new products, quality drops, no personal time.

### Q5: Vision
> "If you could get 15 hours a week back from the admin side, what would you do with that time?"

**Listen for:** More content creation, new product lines, spending time on the homestead, family time. This is your closing fuel.

## The Bridge (3 min)

> "I hear this a lot from homestead business owners. You built something amazing and now you're spending half your time on the stuff that has nothing to do with why you started."

> "Here's what I'd like to do: I've already built a system for a similar business that handles [specific pain point they mentioned]. It saved the owner 15+ hours a week. I'd customize it for [Company] and you'd see results in the first week."

> "I'm doing this as a case study -- so the first automation is free. If it works, we talk about doing more. If not, no hard feelings."

---

## Pricing Approach (Otto Model)

### Step 1: Start Free
> "The first automation is free. I'm building case studies in the homestead space and your business is exactly the kind I want to work with."

### Step 2: Transition to Paid
After the free automation proves value:
> "For the next step, I'd do a full operations audit for $500. That gives you a complete map of every automation opportunity. Then the first paid deliverable is $2,000."

### Step 3: Frame the Pre-Built Advantage
> "I've already built the system for a similar business. I just need to customize it for you. So you're not paying for R&D -- you're paying for deployment."

## Objection Handling

| Objection | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| "Why is it free?" | "I'm building case studies in the homestead space. Your business is a great fit and I want permission to reference the results. The cost is on me." |
| "I'm not technical" | "You don't need to be. I build everything and you just use it. If you can check email, you can use these systems." |
| "I've tried automation before and it didn't work" | "What did you try? Most off-the-shelf tools aren't built for businesses like yours. This is custom-built around how YOU already work." |
| "I'm too busy right now" | "That's actually why this might be perfect timing. The first automation is designed to give you hours back immediately. What's eating most of your time right now?" |
| "My business is too small for this" | "The businesses I work with are exactly your size. 1-3 people doing everything. That's where automation makes the biggest difference -- because every hour you save is an hour you get back personally." |
