# ICP Profile: Homestead Businesses
*Updated: February 16, 2026 - Expanded to 1-50 employees*

---

## Why This Vertical

Solution already built and ready for deployment. S&S Wolf Sheds (shed dealer, 3 AZ locations, targets "rural/semi-rural acreage owners, homesteaders") is the bridge deal. Close Sandra -> deploy pre-built solution -> first homestead case study. Maples Apothecary (rare plant shop, Yuma) also in pipeline.

**No published case study yet -- use zero-risk offer until first case study is published.**

## Ideal Customer Profile

| Attribute | Target |
|-----------|--------|
| Company Size | 1-50 employees (expanded from 1-10) |
| Revenue | $100K-$5M (expanded from $2M ceiling) |
| Role | Owner, CEO, General Manager, Operations Manager |
| Geography | National (mostly online businesses) |
| Business Type | Homesteading-related products, education, or services |

### Company Size Segments

| Segment | Employees | Revenue Range | Decision Maker | Priority |
|---------|-----------|---------------|----------------|----------|
| Micro | 1-10 | $100K-$1M | Owner/Founder | HIGH |
| Small | 11-20 | $500K-$3M | Owner/CEO | HIGH |
| Small-Mid | 21-50 | $1M-$5M | CEO, GM, Ops Manager | MEDIUM (test) |

**Why 1-50:** Owner/GM still accessible. Decision-maker reachable without gatekeepers. Sales cycle remains short (1-2 calls).

## Decision Maker

### 1-20 Employees (Proven ICP)
**Owner.** Always. These are small operations where the owner makes every decision.

### 21-50 Employees (Test Segment)
**CEO, GM, or Operations Manager.** Owner may have stepped back from daily operations, but these roles handle workflow and fulfillment decisions.

| Role | Why They Buy |
|------|--------------|
| General Manager | Handles day-to-day operations |
| Operations Manager | Manages fulfillment and customer service |
| Managing Partner | Often co-owner who handles business side |
| Director | May oversee specific departments |

## Pain Signals (How to Identify Ready Prospects)

### Observable Signals
- Active social media but no automated systems visible
- Selling through Etsy/Shopify with manual fulfillment
- Responding to DMs personally (visible in comment sections)
- Mentions being "overwhelmed" or "behind" in posts/stories
- Hiring a VA (trying to solve the problem with labor)
- Long shipping delays mentioned in reviews
- Content creation frequency dropping (sign of being overwhelmed)

### Operational Pain Points
- Order processing is manual (copy-paste from Etsy/Shopify to shipping labels)
- Customer emails/DMs answered one by one with no templates or automation
- Content scheduling is manual (posting in real-time, not batched)
- Inventory tracked in spreadsheets or in their head
- No automated follow-up after purchase
- Fulfillment bottlenecked by the owner
- Losing orders in DMs and email

### Growth Signals
- Growing audience but order capacity isn't keeping up
- Launching new products but can't handle existing volume
- Want to create courses/digital products but no time
- Seasonal demand spikes they can't manage

## The "Homestead Owner" Profile (1-20 Employees)

The ideal prospect looks like:
- **Passionate homesteader first**, business owner second
- **Built an audience** through content (YouTube, Instagram, blog)
- **Monetized** through products, courses, or services
- **Drowning in admin** -- order processing, customer service, inventory
- **Started this for the lifestyle** but now spends half their time on a laptop
- **Would gladly pay** to get back to the work they love

## The "Growing Farm Business" Profile (21-50 Employees)

The expanded segment looks like a scaled-up version:
- **Founder stepped back** from day-to-day fulfillment
- **$1M-$5M revenue** with multiple team members
- **Operations manager** handles fulfillment, customer service
- **Multiple products/channels** (courses, products, memberships)
- **Wants to scale** but operations can't keep up
- **Has budget** and already tried VAs or basic tools

## Qualification Questions

1. "How do you currently process orders?" (Manual vs automated)
2. "How many customer emails/DMs do you handle per day?" (Volume indicator)
3. "What takes up most of your time that has nothing to do with [homesteading/your craft]?" (Primary pain point)
4. "If you could get 15 hours a week back, what would you do with it?" (Vision/motivation)
5. "Have you tried any tools or hired help to manage the backend?" (Previous attempts)
