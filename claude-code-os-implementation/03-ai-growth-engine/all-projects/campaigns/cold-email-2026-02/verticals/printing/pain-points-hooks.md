## Pain Point #1: THE OWNER BOTTLENECK (Critical Hook)

**The Pain:**
> "If I don't come to work, we make no money."

- Business 100% dependent on owner's personal effort
- Cannot scale beyond physical presence
- No vacation, no sick days, no exit strategy
- Trading hours for dollars forever

**Outreach Hook:**
> "Most printer service owners are trapped working IN the business instead of ON it. What if your technicians could handle 90% of calls without calling you?"

**Email Sequence:** `email-sequences/sequence-a-owner-bottleneck.md`

---

## Pain Point #2: KNOWLEDGE TRAPPED IN ONE HEAD

**The Pain:**
> "Every new tech costs 120-200 hours of my time to train"

- Tribal knowledge with no documentation
- Owner exhausted from training the same things repeatedly
- Past employees leaving = lost expertise
- Can't hire fast enough to grow

**Outreach Hook:**
> "You've spent 20 years learning printer repair. Should you really have to teach it from scratch to every new hire?"

**Email Sequence:** `email-sequences/sequence-d-training-tax.md`

---

## Pain Point #3: COMMUNICATION CHAOS

**The Pain:**
> "I have 10 email inboxes and broken notifications"

- Fragmented communication across multiple systems
- Calls, texts, emails scattered
- Customers confused about which number to call
- Manual handoffs between field and office

**Outreach Hook:**
> "How many hours does your office staff spend just finding where that customer message went?"

**Email Sequence:** `email-sequences/sequence-b-communication-chaos.md`

---

## Pain Point #4: INVENTORY BLINDNESS

**The Pain:**
> "I have no f***ing clue what I have in stock"

- No real-time visibility into parts/supplies
- Whiteboard tracking (gets erased)
- 30-50 customer calls/week asking "do you have this?"
- RMA backlog piling up

**Outreach Hook:**
> "Every 'let me check and call you back' is a sale at risk. What if your team could answer instantly?"

**Email Sequence:** `email-sequences/sequence-c-inventory-blindness.md`

---

## Pain Point #5: MORNING COORDINATION NIGHTMARE

**The Pain:**
> "1.5-2 hours every morning planning routes"

- Routes change 4 out of 5 days
- Driving "all over town" inefficiently
- Stuck in traffic while jobs wait
- Field updates don't flow back to office

**Outreach Hook:**
> "Your best technician shouldn't be spending 10 hours a week on logistics instead of repairs."

---

## Pain Point #6: PAST TECH FAILURES

**The Pain:**
> "Paid $7,000 to a developer, never saw results"

- Burned by failed software projects
- Skeptical of automation promises
- Complexity of printer/parts data overwhelms generic solutions
- Change fatigue

**Outreach Hook:**
> "We get it. You've tried 'systems' before. Here's what's different about solutions built specifically for service companies..."

---

## Pain Point #7: DUPLICATE DATA BREAKING EVERYTHING

**The Pain:**
> "We have seven Daves in the system"

- Same customer entered multiple times
- Can't merge records in Jobber
- QuickBooks sync constantly breaking
- 30 min/day manual reconciliation

**Outreach Hook:**
> "How much time does your office spend cleaning up data instead of serving customers?"

---

## Pain Point #8: PARTS RESEARCH BLACK HOLE

**The Pain:**
> "It can take 30 minutes to figure out which part fits"

- HP, Canon, Epson, Roland all have different part systems
- Cross-referencing takes specialist knowledge
- Vendor calls add 15 min per order
- Customers waiting while you research

**Outreach Hook:**
> "What if your team could find the right part in 2 minutes instead of 30?"

---

## LinkedIn Content Themes

1. **"The Owner Trap"** - Posts about scaling beyond yourself
2. **"Training Tax"** - The hidden cost of onboarding techs
3. **"Inbox Zero for Service Companies"** - Communication consolidation
4. **"Know Your Stock"** - Inventory visibility wins
