## The Client

| Detail | Info |
|--------|------|
| Company | Plotter Mechanix |
| Location | Phoenix, AZ |
| Owner | Kelsey |
| Admin | Alyssa |
| Revenue | ~$800K |
| Employees | Small team |
| Speciality | HP wide-format printer service, repair, and consulting |

---

## The Problem

- Kelsey was the only tech AND the business manager
- Every call, quote, dispatch, and follow-up went through her
- Alyssa (admin) spent **25 hours/week** manually processing:
  - Incoming calls into service tickets
  - Quotes and estimates
  - Work orders and scheduling
  - Customer follow-up
- Kelsey was stuck billing at **$175/hr as a technician** instead of growing the business
- Couldn't step away from day-to-day operations
- Growth was capped by Kelsey's personal capacity

---

## The Solution (Phase 1)

- Auto-routing incoming calls to the right workflow
- Automated service ticket creation from calls
- Triage system that handles initial customer contact
- Streamlined quote-to-job process
- Automated customer follow-up sequences

**Investment:** $5,000
**Timeline:** ~3 weeks to build and deploy

---

## The Results

| Metric | Before | After | Impact |
|--------|--------|-------|--------|
| Alyssa's admin hours | 25 hrs/week | 10 hrs/week | **15 hrs/week saved** |
| Kelsey's billing rate | $175/hr (technician) | $300-500/hr (consultant) | **2-3x rate increase** |
| Annual value created | -- | $73,000+ | **1,378% ROI** |
| Operations bottleneck | Kelsey was the bottleneck | System handles triage | **Owner freed up** |

---

## Phase 2 (In Progress)

- Proposal range: **$15,000 - $42,000**
- Expanding automation across entire operation
- Videos being produced to document the transformation
- Kelsey transitioning fully from technician to consultant role

## How to Use This in Pitches

### In Cold Emails
- Email 1: "1,378% ROI on their first project" (brief mention + Loom link)
- Email 2: Full Kelsey + Alyssa story (25 hrs -> 10 hrs, $175 -> $500/hr)
- Email 3: "$5K experiment that changed everything" (investment -> annual value)

### In Discovery Calls
> "You sound a lot like Kelsey at Plotter Mechanix. She was the best tech in the shop but also running every aspect of the business. Her admin was drowning in 25 hours of manual processing per week. We built a system that cut that to 10 hours and freed Kelsey to transition from a $175/hr technician to a $300-500/hr consultant. The Phase 1 investment was $5K and it generates $73K+ annually. Here's how I'd adapt it for you..."

### In Proposals
- Reference the 1,378% ROI as proof of concept
- Compare prospect's situation to Kelsey's "before" state
- Position Phase 1 as the same $5K starting point
- Let results sell Phase 2
