## Pain Signals (How to Identify Ready Prospects)

### Observable Signals
- Hiring on job boards (trying to clone themselves)
- One-person bottleneck visible in reviews ("great service but hard to reach")
- Manual scheduling/dispatch evident from website (phone-only booking)
- Owner listed as both sales and service contact
- Small team but wide geographic coverage
- Long response times mentioned in reviews

### Operational Pain Points
- Owner is the best tech AND the business manager
- Every call, quote, and dispatch goes through one person
- Admin staff drowning in manual processing (the Alyssa problem)
- No system for auto-routing calls or creating tickets
- Scheduling is phone/email based, no automation
- Customer follow-up is manual or nonexistent
- Quoting process is slow and bottlenecked

### Growth Signals
- Revenue growing but operations can't keep up
- Turning away jobs because of capacity constraints
- Owner wants to transition from technician to business owner
- Looking to hire but can't find qualified techs

## The "Kelsey Profile"

The ideal prospect looks like Kelsey before working with us:
- **Expert technician** who built a business around their skill
- **$500K-$5M revenue** proving the business works
- **Wearing every hat** -- sales, service, scheduling, admin, quoting
- **Admin staff overwhelmed** with manual processing
- **Wants to grow** but can't because they're the bottleneck
- **Would pay for time back** if they trusted it would actually work

## Qualification Questions

2. "Who handles scheduling and dispatch right now?" (Bottleneck identifier)
3. "What does your quote-to-job process look like?" (Automation opportunity)
4. "How much time does your team spend on admin vs actual service work?" (Pain quantifier)
5. "If you could get 15 hours a week back from admin, what would you do with it?" (Vision/motivation)
