## Ideal Customer Profile

| Attribute | Target |
|-----------|--------|
| Company Size | 2-50 employees (expanded from 2-20) |
| Revenue | $500K-$10M (expanded from $5M ceiling) |
| Role | Owner-operator, CEO, VP Operations, GM |
| Geography | National (printer repair is everywhere) |
| Business Type | Large format printer service, repair, sales, and support |

### Company Size Segments

| Segment | Employees | Revenue Range | Decision Maker | Priority |
|---------|-----------|---------------|----------------|----------|
| Micro | 2-10 | $500K-$1M | Owner/Founder | HIGH |
| Small | 11-20 | $1M-$5M | Owner/CEO | HIGH |
| Small-Mid | 21-50 | $3M-$10M | CEO, GM, VP Ops | MEDIUM (test) |

**Why 2-50:** Owner/GM still accessible. Decision-maker reachable without gatekeepers. Sales cycle remains short (1-2 calls).

## Decision Maker

### 2-20 Employees (Proven ICP)
**Owner.** These are small shops -- the owner IS the decision maker. No gatekeepers, no committees. One conversation, one decision.

### 21-50 Employees (Test Segment)
**CEO, GM, or VP Operations.** Owner may be less hands-on, but these roles handle vendor/tool decisions. May need 2 conversations instead of 1.

| Role | Why They Buy |
|------|--------------|
| VP Operations | Handles day-to-day operations pain |
| COO | Responsible for efficiency metrics |
| General Manager | Often the de facto decision-maker |
| Operations Director | Manages technicians and workflows |

## Pain Signals (How to Identify Ready Prospects)

### Observable Signals
- Hiring on job boards (trying to clone themselves)
- One-person bottleneck visible in reviews ("great service but hard to reach")
- Manual scheduling/dispatch evident from website (phone-only booking)
- Owner listed as both sales and service contact
- Small team but wide geographic coverage
- Long response times mentioned in reviews

### Operational Pain Points
- Owner is the best tech AND the business manager
- Every call, quote, and dispatch goes through one person
- Admin staff drowning in manual processing (the Alyssa problem)
- No system for auto-routing calls or creating tickets
- Scheduling is phone/email based, no automation
- Customer follow-up is manual or nonexistent
- Quoting process is slow and bottlenecked

### Growth Signals
- Revenue growing but operations can't keep up
- Turning away jobs because of capacity constraints
- Owner wants to transition from technician to business owner
- Looking to hire but can't find qualified techs

## The "Kelsey Profile" (2-20 Employees)

The ideal prospect looks like Kelsey before working with us:
- **Expert technician** who built a business around their skill
- **$500K-$5M revenue** proving the business works
- **Wearing every hat** -- sales, service, scheduling, admin, quoting
- **Admin staff overwhelmed** with manual processing
- **Wants to grow** but can't because they're the bottleneck
- **Would pay for time back** if they trusted it would actually work

## The "Growing Shop Profile" (21-50 Employees)

The expanded segment looks like a scaled-up version:
- **Founder stepped back** from day-to-day tech work
- **$3M-$10M revenue** with multiple technicians
- **Operations manager or GM** handles scheduling/dispatch
- **Multiple admin staff** still doing manual processing
- **Wants to scale** but ops can't keep up with growth
- **Has budget** but needs ROI proof before committing

## Sub-Niches Within Printing

1. **Large format printer service/repair** (exactly Plotter Mechanix)
2. **Wide-format printer dealers** (sell + service HP, Canon, Epson)
3. **Plotter equipment companies** (specialized equipment)
4. **Sign shops with service departments** (repair + production)
5. **Print equipment resellers** (used equipment + service contracts)

---

## Qualification Questions

1. "How many service calls do you handle per week?" (Volume indicator)
2. "Who handles scheduling and dispatch right now?" (Bottleneck identifier)
3. "What does your quote-to-job process look like?" (Automation opportunity)
4. "How much time does your team spend on admin vs actual service work?" (Pain quantifier)
5. "If you could get 15 hours a week back from admin, what would you do with it?" (Vision/motivation)
