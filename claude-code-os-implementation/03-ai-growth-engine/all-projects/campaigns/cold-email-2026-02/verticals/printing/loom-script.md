## Script

### Opening (30 seconds)

> "Hey, I noticed your company online. You service [HP/Canon/Epson] wide-format printers, right? I work with companies just like yours, and I wanted to share something that might save you a ton of time."

**Visual:** Webcam only, friendly wave.

---

### The Problem (60 seconds)

> "Most print service shops I talk to have the same bottleneck -- the owner is also the best tech. Every call, every quote, every dispatch goes through one person. Sound familiar? We built a system for a plotter repair company in Phoenix that auto-routes calls, creates service tickets, and handles the initial triage so the owner isn't the bottleneck anymore."

**Visual:** Switch to screen share showing a simple workflow diagram (call comes in -> auto-routed -> ticket created -> assigned to tech).

### The Result (60 seconds)

> "The result: their admin went from 25 hours a week of manual processing down to 10. The owner is now transitioning from being a $175/hr technician to a $300-500/hr consultant. Total Phase 1 investment was $5K. The ROI was over 1,300%."

**Visual:** Screen share with key metrics:
- 25 hrs/week -> 10 hrs/week (15 hrs saved)
- $175/hr tech -> $300-500/hr consultant
- $5K investment -> $73K+ annual value
- 1,378% ROI

### The Offer (60 seconds)

> "For your shop, I'd build something similar -- probably starting with automated call routing and service ticket creation. It takes about 2-3 weeks to set up and you'd see results immediately."

**Visual:** Back to webcam. Genuine, direct eye contact.

---

### The Close (30 seconds)

> "If any of this sounds useful, just reply to my email. If not, no worries at all. Either way, hope it was helpful."

**Visual:** Webcam, casual wave goodbye.

## Recording Tips

1. Record in one take -- small imperfections make it feel authentic
2. Don't read from a script -- use the bullet points above as guides
3. Keep it under 4 minutes (shorter = higher completion rate)
4. Mention a specific detail about the prospect's company if possible (batch different versions for top prospects)
5. Upload to Loom, grab the share link, paste into email template
