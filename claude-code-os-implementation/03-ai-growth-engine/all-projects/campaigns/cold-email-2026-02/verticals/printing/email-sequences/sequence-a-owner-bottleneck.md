# Sequence A: "Owner Bottleneck" Hook

## Target Profile
Printer/plotter service company owners working 60+ hrs/week who are trapped as the sole technical expert.

## EMAIL 1: The Trap (Day 1, Tuesday)

**Subject:** `Quick question about your Phoenix printer service`

```
Hey [First Name],

Most printer service owners I talk to say the same thing:

"If I don't come to work, we make no money."

Sound familiar?

I work with wide-format service companies to build systems that let technicians handle 90% of calls without calling the owner.

One Phoenix-area company just recovered 10+ hours per week for their owner to focus on growth instead of firefighting.

Worth a 15-min call to see if something similar makes sense for [Company]?

## EMAIL 2: The Cost (Day 4, Saturday)

**Subject:** `Re: Quick question about your Phoenix printer service`

```
[First Name] —

Quick math:

If training a new tech costs you 150 hours of your time...
And your billable rate is $150-175/hour...
That's $22,000-$26,000 per hire in lost revenue.

What if you could cut that to 40 hours?

That's $16,000+ back in your pocket — every time you hire.

We built a system for a service company owner that did exactly this. Happy to share what worked.

Reply "show me" if you want the details.

## EMAIL 3: Social Proof (Day 8, Wednesday)

**Subject:** `How a Phoenix plotter service cut training time by 70%`

```
[First Name],

Just wrapped Phase 1 with a printer service company in Phoenix:

→ Phone system that auto-logs calls in their CRM
→ AI that summarizes customer issues before the tech calls back
→ 1,378% ROI on a $5K investment

They were losing $10K/year just on communication chaos.

If you're curious what a similar setup would look like for [Company], I can show you in 15 minutes.

Here's my calendar: [link]

Hey [First Name],

Haven't heard back — totally fine. You're busy fixing printers.

All the best,
