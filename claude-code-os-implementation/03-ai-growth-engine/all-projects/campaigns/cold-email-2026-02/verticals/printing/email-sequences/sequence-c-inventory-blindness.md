# Sequence C: "Inventory Blindness" Hook

## Target Profile
Service companies with parts/supplies inventory who rely on manual tracking (whiteboards, spreadsheets) and lose sales to "let me check and call you back."

## EMAIL 1: The Question (Day 1, Tuesday)

**Subject:** `"Let me check and call you back"`

```
[First Name],

How many times per week does your team say:

"Let me check if we have that in stock and call you back."

For one printer service company, it was 30-50 times per week.

No inventory system. Whiteboard counts. Parts scattered across shelves.

Every "I'll call you back" is a sale at risk.

If you're flying blind on inventory, I've got a fix that works.

## EMAIL 2: The Fix (Day 4, Saturday)

**Subject:** `Re: "Let me check and call you back"`

```
[First Name] —

Quick update on that inventory problem:

We're implementing barcode scanning + real-time stock visibility for a Phoenix plotter service company.

Their team will go from "I think we have it" to "Yes, we have 3 in stock — I can have a tech there tomorrow."

Same system handles:
→ PO tracking for RMA resolution
→ Parts lookup in 2 minutes (not 30)
→ Automatic reorder alerts

Worth exploring for [Company]?

## EMAIL 3: The ROI (Day 8, Wednesday)

**Subject:** `What "inventory blindness" actually costs`

```
[First Name],

Quick math on the inventory problem:

→ 30-50 "let me check" calls/week × $250 avg job = $7,500-$12,500/week at risk
→ Even 5% lost to callbacks = $375-$625/week in missed revenue
→ That's $20-30K/year in preventable losses

One Phoenix service company invested $5K in Phase 1 systems and is seeing 1,378% ROI.

If you're curious what inventory visibility would look like for [Company], I can show you in 15 minutes.

## Key Pain Point Addressed

**INVENTORY BLINDNESS**
> "I have no f***ing clue what I have in stock"

This sequence targets service companies with no real-time inventory visibility, losing sales to delays in answering stock questions.
