# Sequence G: "The Rate Transformation" Hook

## Campaign Type
Identity-Shift

## Target Profile
Wide-format printer service owners stuck trading hours for dollars. They're the best technician in the shop but can't escape the wrench. They undercharge because they price like a tech, not a consultant. Every job depends on them personally showing up.

## Emotional Anchor
**Core Shift:** From technician mindset to consultant mindset
**Dream Outcome:** Charge for expertise, not labor. Build a business that runs without you holding every wrench.

## EMAIL 1: Pain Recognition (Day 1, Tuesday)

**Subject:** `You're still the best tech in the shop`

```
Quick question for you:

When was the last time you took a full week off without a single phone call about a job?

I talk to a lot of printer service owners. The pattern I see: You built this business because you're exceptional at the work. Now you're trapped by that same excellence.

Every job needs YOUR hands. YOUR diagnosis. YOUR expertise.

Am I close?

## EMAIL 2: The Destination Cost (Day 2, Thursday)

**Subject:** `Re: You're still the best tech in the shop`

```
Here's what staying stuck in "technician mode" actually costs:

You cap your income at your hours. 40 billable hours is your ceiling.

Your rate stays low because you're pricing labor, not expertise. That diagnostic skill you spent 15 years developing? You're charging the same as someone who watched a YouTube video.

Your family gets what's left after every customer emergency.

And the brutal part - the business can't survive without you. No exit. No scale. No breathing room.

This isn't a time management problem. It's an identity problem.

## EMAIL 3: The Transformation (Day 4, Saturday)

**Subject:** `The shift that changes everything`

```
We recently worked with a Phoenix printer service owner who realized something uncomfortable:

He WAS the bottleneck.

Not his team. Not his systems. Him.

Here's how we helped him see it differently - through our 3-pillar approach:

**CONSULTING:** We interviewed him, his admin, and his tech separately. Mapped every touchpoint. Found where his expertise was being wasted on tasks anyone could do.

**DEVELOPMENT:** Built AI systems so routine calls, scheduling, and follow-ups happened without him. Smart routing. Automated summaries. CRM integration that actually worked.

**EDUCATION:** Trained his team to handle what he used to hoard. Created SOPs. Daily support until it clicked.

The shift: He stopped selling his hands. Started selling his brain.

That's consultant pricing.

## EMAIL 4: The Invitation (Day 7, Tuesday)

**Subject:** `March 17th: See the diagnosis in action`

```
If any of this hit close to home, I want to invite you to something.

We're hosting a free online workshop on March 17th at 7 PM EST where we break down exactly how we diagnose operational chaos in service businesses - the same process we used with a Phoenix printer company to find 30 hours of weekly chaos hiding in plain sight. Register here: [Eventbrite link]

No pitch. Just the actual diagnostic process we use.

You'll see exactly how we uncover where owner expertise gets trapped in technician work - and what the path out looks like.

If you can't make it live, reply and I'll send the recording.
