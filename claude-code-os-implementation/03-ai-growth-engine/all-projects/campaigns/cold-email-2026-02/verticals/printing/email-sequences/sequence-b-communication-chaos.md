# Sequence B: "Communication Chaos" Hook

## Target Profile
Service companies with office managers drowning in admin work, multiple inboxes, and fragmented communication.

## EMAIL 1: The Symptom (Day 1, Tuesday)

**Subject:** `10 inboxes, zero sanity`

```
[First Name],

Quick question:

How many email inboxes does your team monitor for [Company]?

I ask because a printer service company I'm working with had 10. Their office manager spent 25 hours/week — half her time — just processing messages.

We consolidated it to 2 inboxes with smart routing. She got 15 hours back instantly.

If your team is drowning in communication, might be worth a quick chat.

## EMAIL 2: The Hidden Cost (Day 4, Saturday)

**Subject:** `Re: 10 inboxes, zero sanity`

```
[First Name] —

Here's what "communication chaos" actually costs:

→ Missed callbacks = lost jobs ($250+ each)
→ Duplicate data entry = 30 min/day wasted
→ Customer confusion = "which number do I call?"

One service company found they had "seven Daves" in their CRM because calls came in through so many channels.

If that sounds familiar, I can show you what we built to fix it.

Reply "fix it" and I'll send details.

## EMAIL 3: The Solution (Day 8, Wednesday)

**Subject:** `How we fixed the "seven Daves" problem`

```
[First Name],

Quick update on what we built for a Phoenix printer service company:

→ All calls automatically logged in CRM (no manual entry)
→ AI summaries before the tech calls back
→ Single source of truth for customer data

Their office manager went from 25 hrs/week processing → 10 hrs/week.

1,378% ROI on a $5K investment.

If you're curious what a similar setup would look like for [Company], I can show you in 15 minutes.
