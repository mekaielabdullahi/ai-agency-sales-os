# Sequence D: "Training Tax" Hook

## Target Profile
Owners frustrated with technician turnover and the massive time investment required to train each new hire.

## EMAIL 1: The Burden (Day 1, Tuesday)

**Subject:** `200 hours to train a tech`

```
[First Name],

Here's a number that makes printer service owners wince:

**200 hours.**

That's how long it takes to train a new technician to handle calls independently.

At $175/hour billable, that's $35,000 in lost revenue per hire.

What if you could cut it to 50 hours?

I'm working with a service company owner on exactly this — building a "clone Kelsey" system so new hires learn from video + AI instead of shadowing.

If training is draining you, let's talk.

## EMAIL 2: The Math (Day 4, Saturday)

**Subject:** `Re: 200 hours to train a tech`

```
[First Name] —

Quick math on the training problem:

If you hire 2 techs this year:
→ 200 hours × 2 = 400 hours of your time
→ At $175/hr billable = $70,000 in lost revenue

If you cut training to 50 hours:
→ 50 hours × 2 = 100 hours
→ That's $52,500 back in billable work

The system pays for itself on the first hire.

Reply "show me" if you want to see how it works.

## EMAIL 3: The System (Day 8, Wednesday)

**Subject:** `how to "clone yourself" for new hires`

```
[First Name],

Here's what we're building for a Phoenix printer service company:

→ Video library of common repairs (indexed by printer model)
→ AI-powered troubleshooting guide
→ Parts lookup in 2 minutes instead of 30
→ New hire onboarding checklist with progress tracking

Goal: Cut training from 200 hours to 50 hours.

Same company achieved 1,378% ROI on their Phase 1 investment.

If you're tired of being the only one who knows how to fix things, I can show you what this looks like in 15 minutes.

## EMAIL 4: Breakup (Day 12, Sunday)

**Subject:** `closing the loop`

```
Hey [First Name],

Haven't heard back — totally fine. You're busy training techs (or fixing printers yourself).

If timing is ever better: mekaiel@arisegroup.ai

The free operations audit offer stands whenever you're ready.

All the best,

## Key Pain Point Addressed

**KNOWLEDGE TRAPPED IN ONE HEAD**
> "Every new tech costs 120-200 hours of my time to train"

This sequence targets owners exhausted from training the same things repeatedly, with tribal knowledge that has no documentation.
