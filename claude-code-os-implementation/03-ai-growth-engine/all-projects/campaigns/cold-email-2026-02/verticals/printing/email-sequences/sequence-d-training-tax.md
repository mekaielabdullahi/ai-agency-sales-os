# Sequence D: "The Training Tax" Hook

## Campaign Type
Hidden-Costs (Knowledge Bottleneck Pattern)

## Target Profile
Wide-format printer service company owners exhausted from training the same things repeatedly. Every new hire costs 150-200 hours of the owner's time. Tribal knowledge lives in one head. There's no documentation, no video library, no system - just shadowing the boss until something sticks. And when a tech leaves? All that investment walks out the door.

## Emotional Anchor
**Verbatim Quote:** "Every new tech costs 120-200 hours of my time to train"
**Dream Outcome:** Cut training from 200 hours to 50 hours per hire - clone your expertise into systems so new hires learn from AI and video instead of shadowing

## EMAIL 1: Pain Recognition (Day 1, Tuesday)

**Subject:** `200 hours to train a tech`

```
A printer service owner in Phoenix told me something that made me pause:

"Every new tech costs me 120-200 hours of my time to train."

Not his manager's time. Not a training program. HIS time. Personally. Every hire.

Because everything he knows - the diagnostics, the customer quirks, the parts shortcuts, the "this model always does this" knowledge - lives in his head. Nowhere else.

So every new hire means months of shadowing. And every tech who leaves takes all that investment with them.

If your training process is basically "follow me around until you get it" - you're not alone.

## EMAIL 2: The Destination Cost (Day 2, Thursday)

**Subject:** `Re: 200 hours to train a tech`

```
Here's what the training tax actually costs:

200 hours of your time per hire. That's 5 full work weeks where you're teaching instead of billing, building, or breathing.

And it's not just the time. It's the opportunity cost. Every hour you spend explaining the same thing to a new tech is an hour you can't spend on the jobs only you can do.

When a trained tech leaves - and they will - you start over. From zero. The same lessons. The same mistakes. The same 200 hours.

Meanwhile, your competitors who figured out how to document their knowledge are hiring faster, scaling faster, and losing less when someone walks.

The training tax doesn't decrease with experience. It compounds with growth. More hires = more of your time consumed.

## EMAIL 3: The Transformation (Day 4, Saturday)

**Subject:** `How we're "cloning" a Phoenix owner's expertise`

```
That Phoenix printer service owner I mentioned - his training bottleneck was just one symptom of knowledge trapped in one head.

Here's how we approached it:

**CONSULTING:** We interviewed the owner, admin, and tech separately. Mapped every piece of tribal knowledge the owner was manually transferring. Found the 20% of knowledge that covered 80% of situations. Quantified the hours lost per hire.

**DEVELOPMENT:** Built systems that capture and deploy expertise without the owner. Video library indexed by printer model. AI-powered troubleshooting guides. Parts lookup in 2 minutes instead of 30. Onboarding checklists with progress tracking. Call transcription so new hires can learn from real customer interactions.

**EDUCATION:** Trained the team on using the new knowledge base. Daily support. Loom walkthroughs. SOPs that new hires actually follow because the system is built around how they learn.

The goal: cut training from 200 hours to 50. The owner's expertise lives in systems now, not just his head.

## EMAIL 4: The Invitation (Day 7, Tuesday)

**Subject:** `March 17th - see how we extract tribal knowledge`

```
The training problem is really a knowledge problem.

Everything your business knows lives in your head. When you train, you're doing a slow, manual transfer of that knowledge - one conversation at a time, one repair at a time.

There's a better way to extract it.

We're hosting a free online workshop on March 17th at 7 PM EST where we break down exactly how we diagnose operational chaos in service businesses - the same process we used with a Phoenix printer company to find 30 hours of weekly chaos hiding in plain sight. Register here: [Eventbrite link]

We'll show you how we identify where knowledge is trapped and how to build systems that make it accessible to your whole team.

If you can't make it, reply and tell me: how many hours does it take you to train a new tech right now? Sometimes that number alone reveals more than you'd expect.
