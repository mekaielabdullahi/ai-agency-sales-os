# Email Sequences: Printing Vertical (Hormozi Framework)

## Overview

This folder contains eight emotional email sequences built on Alex Hormozi's Value Equation framework. Each sequence targets a specific VISCERAL pain point using verbatim quotes from real stakeholder interviews.

**Value = (Dream Outcome × Likelihood of Achievement) / (Time Delay × Effort & Sacrifice)**

Specifically written for office managers and admins to forward to owners.

### Operations-Focused (D)
Targets the operational pain of losing context between customer interactions.

All sequences close with:
> "We're hosting a free online workshop on March 17th at 7 PM EST where we break down exactly how we diagnose operational chaos in service businesses - the same process we used with a Phoenix printer company to find 30 hours of weekly chaos hiding in plain sight. Register here: [Eventbrite link]"

- Unified Phone System (merged 2 lines into intelligent system)
- Smart Call Routing with IVR and business hours
- AI Transcription + Summaries for every call
- Jobber CRM Integration with automatic request creation
- 24/7 AI Assistant for after-hours coverage

**3. EDUCATION** - Training + knowledge transfer
