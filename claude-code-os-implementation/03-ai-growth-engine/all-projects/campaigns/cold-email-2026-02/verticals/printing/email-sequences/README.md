# Email Sequences: Printing Vertical (Hormozi Framework)

## Overview

This folder contains twelve emotional email sequences built on Alex Hormozi's Value Equation framework. Each sequence targets a specific VISCERAL pain point using verbatim quotes from real stakeholder interviews.

**Value = (Dream Outcome × Likelihood of Achievement) / (Time Delay × Effort & Sacrifice)**

## Campaign Categories

### Fear-Based (A1, A2)
Targets owners who fear their own success or are trapped as the single point of failure.

### Time-Based (B1, B2)
Targets owners working massive hours but feeling unproductive, or teams buried in fragmented communication.

### Admin-Targeted (C1, C2)
Targets office managers drowning in email chaos or parts inventory blindness - written to resonate with admins who forward to owners.

### Operations-Focused (D1, D2)
Targets the operational pain of losing context between interactions or the hidden cost of training every new hire from scratch.

### Data-Chaos (E)
Targets the shame of messy CRM, scattered contacts, and duplicate records.

### Lifestyle (F)
Targets the emotional cost - family time, vacations, personal freedom sacrificed.

### Identity-Shift (G)
Targets the mental shift from technician (trading hours) to consultant (selling expertise).

### Hidden-Costs (H)
Targets money silently rotting in vendor backlogs and RMA piles.

## CTA: March 17th Free Workshop

All sequences close with:
> "We're hosting a free online workshop on March 17th at 7 PM EST where we break down exactly how we diagnose operational chaos in service businesses - the same process we used with a Phoenix printer company to find 30 hours of weekly chaos hiding in plain sight. Register here: [Eventbrite link]"

## The 3-Pillar Approach (Used in Email 3)

**1. CONSULTING** - Deep diagnosis before touching any tech
- Interviewed owner, admin, and tech separately
- Mapped every touchpoint where information disappeared
- Quantified "confusion hours" vs productive hours
- Delivered PlotterOps Blueprint (full roadmap)

**2. DEVELOPMENT** - Custom AI systems built for service businesses
- Unified Phone System (merged 2 lines into intelligent system)
- Smart Call Routing with IVR and business hours
- AI Transcription + Summaries for every call
- Jobber CRM Integration with automatic request creation
- 24/7 AI Assistant for after-hours coverage

**3. EDUCATION** - Training + knowledge transfer
- Live Google Meet workshops
- Daily WhatsApp support
- Loom training videos
- One-page SOPs
- 30-day support period

## Signature Standard

All emails use consistent branding:
- **Email 1 & 4:** Sign off with `- Mekaiel` + `AriseGroup.ai`
- **Email 2 & 3:** Sign off with `- Mekaiel` (no domain - keeps it personal)

- **Sequences C1-C2 (Admin/Inventory):** 10 contacts each
- **Sequences D1-D2 (Ops/Training):** 10 contacts each

### Phase 2: Optimize (Week 3-4)
- Double down on highest reply rates
- Test subject line variations
- Refine based on response patterns
