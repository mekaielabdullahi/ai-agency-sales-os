# Email Sequences: Printing Vertical

## Overview

This folder contains four hook-based email sequences that complement the main proof-led sequence (`../email-sequence.md`). Each sequence targets a specific pain point in the wide-format printer service industry.

## Sequence Variants

| Sequence | Pain Point | Target Profile | File |
|----------|------------|----------------|------|
| **A** | Owner Bottleneck | Owners working 60+ hrs/week, trapped as sole expert | [sequence-a-owner-bottleneck.md](sequence-a-owner-bottleneck.md) |
| **B** | Communication Chaos | Office managers drowning in multiple inboxes | [sequence-b-communication-chaos.md](sequence-b-communication-chaos.md) |
| **C** | Inventory Blindness | Teams using whiteboard tracking, losing sales | [sequence-c-inventory-blindness.md](sequence-c-inventory-blindness.md) |
| **D** | Training Tax | Owners frustrated with 200-hour onboarding | [sequence-d-training-tax.md](sequence-d-training-tax.md) |

## A/B Testing Strategy

### Week 1-2: Initial Deploy
- **Main Sequence (proof-led):** 20 contacts
- **Sequence A (owner bottleneck):** 10 contacts
- **Sequence B (communication chaos):** 10 contacts
- **Sequence C (inventory blindness):** 10 contacts

### Week 3-4: Optimize
- Double down on highest-performing hook
- Refine subject lines based on open rates
- Test combinations (e.g., owner bottleneck hook + proof-led close)
