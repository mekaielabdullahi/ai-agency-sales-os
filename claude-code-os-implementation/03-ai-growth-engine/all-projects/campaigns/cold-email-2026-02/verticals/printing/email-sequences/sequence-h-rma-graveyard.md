# Sequence H: "The RMA Graveyard" Hook

## Campaign Type
Hidden-Costs

## Target Profile
Wide-format printer service companies with vendor backlog problems. RMAs sitting uncollected. Parts piling up. POs sent months ago with no follow-up. Money literally rotting in boxes and on shelves because nobody has time to chase it down.

## Emotional Anchor
**Verbatim Quote:** "You see that pile behind you? That's all RMA stuff. Most of that is from last year."
**Dream Outcome:** No more money rotting in piles. Every RMA tracked, followed up, and resolved. Cash recovered from the graveyard.

## EMAIL 1: Pain Recognition (Day 1, Tuesday)

**Subject:** `That pile behind you`

```
"You see that pile behind you? That's all RMA stuff. Most of that is from last year."

A Phoenix service owner said this to me while pointing at boxes stacked against his warehouse wall.

Last year's returns. Still sitting there. Money in limbo.

I'm curious - if you looked around your shop right now, is there a pile like that somewhere? Parts waiting to go back. Credits never collected. POs sent into the void.

How much is just... sitting there?

## EMAIL 2: The Destination Cost (Day 2, Thursday)

**Subject:** `Re: That pile behind you`

```
Here's what that RMA pile actually represents:

Cash you already spent, waiting to come back. Every month it sits there, that's working capital you can't use.

Vendor relationships slowly eroding because nobody followed up. They think you forgot. You think they're handling it. Nobody's handling it.

Your team walking past it every day, feeling the weight of "we should really deal with that" - but there's always a more urgent fire.

And the quiet truth: You don't even know what's in there anymore. Could be hundreds in credits. Could be thousands.

The pile grows. The urgency fades. The money stays buried.

This is what "we'll get to it later" actually costs.

## EMAIL 3: The Transformation (Day 4, Saturday)

**Subject:** `Clearing the graveyard`

```
When we worked with that Phoenix printer company, the RMA pile was just one symptom.

The real problem: nothing was tracked, nothing was followed up, and everything depended on someone remembering.

Here's how we approached it through our 3-pillar process:

**CONSULTING:** We mapped every touchpoint where parts and money get stuck. PO submission. Vendor confirmation. RMA initiation. Credit collection. Found the gaps where things disappear.

**DEVELOPMENT:** Built tracking workflows that don't depend on memory. Automatic follow-ups when vendors go quiet. PO status visibility. RMA resolution alerts. Systems that chase so your team doesn't have to.

**EDUCATION:** Trained the team on the new process. Daily support via WhatsApp. Loom videos for every workflow. SOPs that actually get used.

The pile didn't just shrink - the graveyard stopped growing.

## EMAIL 4: The Invitation (Day 7, Tuesday)

**Subject:** `See how we found the hidden chaos`

```
If you've got your own RMA graveyard - or you suspect money is hiding in your operations somewhere - this might be worth your time.

We're hosting a free online workshop on March 17th at 7 PM EST where we break down exactly how we diagnose operational chaos in service businesses - the same process we used with a Phoenix printer company to find 30 hours of weekly chaos hiding in plain sight. Register here: [Eventbrite link]

We'll walk through the exact diagnostic we use. You'll see how we map touchpoints, quantify what's stuck, and build the workflows that prevent piles from forming in the first place.

If you can't make the live session, reply "recording" and I'll send it your way.
