## Why This Vertical

Solution already built and ready for deployment. S&S Wolf Sheds (shed dealer, 3 AZ locations, targets "rural/semi-rural acreage owners, homesteaders") is the bridge deal. Close Sandra -> deploy pre-built solution -> first homestead case study. Maples Apothecary (rare plant shop, Yuma) also in pipeline.

**No published case study yet -- use zero-risk offer until first case study is published.**

## Pain Signals (How to Identify Ready Prospects)

### Observable Signals
- Active social media but no automated systems visible
- Selling through Etsy/Shopify with manual fulfillment
- Responding to DMs personally (visible in comment sections)
- Mentions being "overwhelmed" or "behind" in posts/stories
- Hiring a VA (trying to solve the problem with labor)
- Long shipping delays mentioned in reviews
- Content creation frequency dropping (sign of being overwhelmed)

### Operational Pain Points
- Order processing is manual (copy-paste from Etsy/Shopify to shipping labels)
- Customer emails/DMs answered one by one with no templates or automation
- Content scheduling is manual (posting in real-time, not batched)
- Inventory tracked in spreadsheets or in their head
- No automated follow-up after purchase
- Fulfillment bottlenecked by the owner
- Losing orders in DMs and email

### Growth Signals
- Growing audience but order capacity isn't keeping up
- Launching new products but can't handle existing volume
- Want to create courses/digital products but no time
- Seasonal demand spikes they can't manage

## The "Homestead Owner" Profile

The ideal prospect looks like:
- **Passionate homesteader first**, business owner second
- **Built an audience** through content (YouTube, Instagram, blog)
- **Monetized** through products, courses, or services
- **Drowning in admin** -- order processing, customer service, inventory
- **Started this for the lifestyle** but now spends half their time on a laptop
- **Would gladly pay** to get back to the work they love

## Qualification Questions

1. "How do you currently process orders?" (Manual vs automated)
2. "How many customer emails/DMs do you handle per day?" (Volume indicator)
3. "What takes up most of your time that has nothing to do with [homesteading/your craft]?" (Primary pain point)
4. "If you could get 15 hours a week back, what would you do with it?" (Vision/motivation)
5. "Have you tried any tools or hired help to manage the backend?" (Previous attempts)
