## Script

### Opening (30 seconds)

> "Hey, I came across your [business/channel/shop] and was really impressed by what you've built. I work with small businesses on automation -- making the backend stuff run itself so you can focus on the work you actually love."

**Visual:** Webcam only, friendly and genuine.

---

### The Problem (60 seconds)

> "Most homestead business owners I've talked to are drowning in the operational side -- order processing, customer emails, content scheduling, inventory tracking. You started this because you love [homesteading/farming/teaching], but now you're spending half your time on admin."

**Visual:** Switch to screen share showing a list of common admin tasks (order emails, shipping labels, DM responses, inventory spreadsheets, content scheduling).

---

### The Result (60 seconds)

> "We recently helped a small business go from completely manual operations to automated -- saved the owner 15+ hours a week. Things like auto-routing customer inquiries, automated follow-ups on orders, and a system that actually tracks inventory without spreadsheets."

**Visual:** Screen share with simple before/after:
- Manual order processing -> Automated
- Individual email responses -> Templated + triggered
- Spreadsheet inventory -> Auto-updated system
- 25+ hrs/week admin -> Under 10 hrs/week

---

### The Offer (60 seconds)

> "Here's what I'd do for you: I'll look at your operation and build ONE automation completely free. Could be order processing, customer follow-up, or whatever your biggest time-killer is. If it works, we talk about more. If not, no hard feelings."

**Visual:** Back to webcam. Direct, genuine.

---

### The Close (30 seconds)

> "Just reply to my email if you're curious. No call needed, no commitment. Hope this was useful."

**Visual:** Webcam, casual wave goodbye.
