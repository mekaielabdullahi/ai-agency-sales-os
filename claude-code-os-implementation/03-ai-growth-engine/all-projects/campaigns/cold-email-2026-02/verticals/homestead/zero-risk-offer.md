# Zero-Risk Offer Framework: Homestead Vertical
## Case Study Offer Until First Published Proof

---

## Why Zero-Risk

No published homestead case study yet. The solution is built and ready to deploy, but prospects don't have a "Plotter Mechanix" to reference. The zero-risk offer removes all friction by:

1. Eliminating financial risk (free)
2. Eliminating time commitment risk (one automation, not a full engagement)
3. Giving a reason for "free" that makes sense (case study, not desperation)
4. Making the "yes" easy ("sure" or "tell me more")

## The Offer

> "I'm building case studies in the homestead space. I'll audit your operations and build one working automation -- completely free. If it saves you time, we talk. If not, we shake hands. I just want the permission to reference your company."

---

## How It Works (For the Prospect)

### Step 1: Reply
They reply "sure" or "tell me more" to the cold email.

### Step 2: Quick Call (20 min)
> "I just want to understand your biggest operational headache. What takes up your time that has nothing to do with [their craft]?"

### Step 3: We Build One Automation (Free)
Pick the highest-impact, fastest-to-deploy automation:
- Order processing automation
- Customer follow-up sequence
- Inventory tracking system
- Inquiry auto-routing
- Content scheduling pipeline

### Step 4: They Use It for 2 Weeks
Let results speak. Don't pitch during this period.

### Step 5: Review Call
> "How's it working? Is it saving you time? Here's what else I could do..."

### Step 6: Expansion Proposal
If results are good: $500 audit + $2,000 first deliverable (Otto model).

## How It Works (For Us)

### The Real Goal
1. Get a foot in the door with zero friction
2. Deploy the pre-built solution (low cost to us since it's already built)
3. Demonstrate value with measurable results
4. Convert to paid engagement ($500 audit + $2K deliverable)
5. Publish the case study for future outreach

### Cost to Us
- 2-4 hours to customize and deploy the pre-built solution
- This is an investment in the case study, not a loss leader

### What We Get
- Permission to reference their company name
- Before/after metrics for the case study
- A testimonial (if results are good)
- A paid client (if they convert)

## Transition Script (Zero-Risk -> Paid)

After the free automation has been running for 2 weeks:

> "So it looks like [the automation] is saving you about [X] hours per week. That's great. Here's what I see as the next steps if you want to keep going:
>
> I'd do a full operations audit -- look at everything from order processing to customer follow-up to content workflow. That's $500 and you get a detailed report of every automation opportunity I find.
>
> From there, I'd build the next system for $2,000. Based on what I've seen, that would probably be [specific automation]. And since I've already built a similar system for another business, I'm essentially customizing it for you -- not starting from scratch.
>
> The $500 audit is the starting point. Want to move forward with that?"
