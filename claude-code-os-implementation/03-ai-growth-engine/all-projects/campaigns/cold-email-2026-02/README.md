## Strategic Foundation

### The Core Insight
**Stop marketing to "anyone and everyone." Go deep on two verticals where you have proof.**

### The Two Verticals

1. **Large Format Printer Companies** (Kelsey/Plotter Mechanix model) - $800K revenue client, 1,378% ROI case study, Phase 1 complete, Phase 2 in progress, videos in production
2. **Homestead Businesses** - Solution already built and ready for deployment. S&S Wolf Sheds is the bridge deal. Close Sandra -> deploy pre-built solution -> first homestead case study.

### Phases

| Phase | Dates | Focus |
|-------|-------|-------|
| Phase 0: Infrastructure | Mon 2/16 - Wed 2/18 | Domains, inboxes, DNS, n8n engine, lead lists, Loom videos |
| Phase 1: Campaign Launch | Mon 2/24 - Fri 3/6 | First cold emails sent, reply handling, discovery calls |
| Phase 2: Optimization | Week 3-4 | A/B testing, ICP refinement, scale triggers |
| Phase 3: Belief System | Ongoing | Weekly conviction meetings, case study rotation |

## Expected Outcomes & Revenue Projection

```
PRINTING VERTICAL:
Week 4:   ~120 emails -> 6-12 replies -> 3-6 calls -> 1-2 proposals -> 0-1 close ($5K Phase 1)
Month 2:  ~300 emails -> 15-30 replies -> 7-15 calls -> 3-6 proposals -> 1-3 closes
Month 3:  ~600+ emails, pipeline compounding -> 2-4 closes -> $10-60K
           + Phase 2 upsells from Month 1 closes ($15-42K each)

HOMESTEAD VERTICAL:
Week 4:   ~60 emails -> 2-3 replies -> 1-2 calls -> 0-1 proposal ($500 audit + $2K deliverable)
Month 2:  S&S Wolf case study published -> improved conversion
Month 3:  First case study driving proof -> 1-2 closes -> $5-20K

WARM LEADS (IMMEDIATE):
Feb Week 1: Close Scott + Randy ($4-8K) + Sandra/S&S Wolf ($500 audit + $2K) = $6.5-10.5K
Feb total: $10-25K from warm leads alone

COMBINED:
Feb:    2-4 warm closes + infrastructure setup -> $10-25K
March:  1-4 cold closes + first homestead case study -> $5-25K
April:  3-6 cold closes + Phase 2 upsells -> $15-80K
= Path to $50K/month by Month 3-4
```

## Key Takeaway (Otto)

> You already have the solution. You already have the proof. You already have the case study. All you need to do now is **find more businesses like Kelsey's and show them what you've built.**
