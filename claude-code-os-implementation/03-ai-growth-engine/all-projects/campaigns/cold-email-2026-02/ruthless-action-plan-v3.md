**RUTHLESS ACTION PLAN**

**VERSION 3.0**

February 2026

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

*"And when you have decided, then rely upon Allah. Indeed, Allah loves those who rely upon Him." (3:159)*

No more planning. No more waiting. Execute.

**I. THE REALITY CHECK**

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

*"Allah does not change the condition of a people until they change what is in themselves." (13:11)*

You have spent years acquiring elite-level skills. Pentagon cybersecurity. NATO infrastructure. Systems integration across 15 embassies on 4 continents. A $5K deployment that enabled $50K in revenue for a Phoenix printing company. 200 on bench. 240 on deadlift. 6 training days a week.

You are not someone who lacks ability.

You are someone who has been building in silence when you should have been executing in public. The gap between what you can do and what the market knows you can do is the gap between where you are and where you belong.

This document closes that gap. No theory. No motivation. Just the exact moves, in order, with deadlines.

**II. BUSINESS — COLD OUTREACH MACHINE**

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

*"And whoever relies upon Allah — then He is sufficient for him. Indeed, Allah will accomplish His purpose." (65:3)*

**A. Email Infrastructure Setup**

Before you send a single cold email, the infrastructure must be airtight. Deliverability is everything.

| COMPONENT | ACTION |
| :---- | :---- |
| Domains | Buy 3 secondary domains (variations of your brand). Never cold email from your primary. |
| Google Workspace | Create 5 inboxes across domains. $6/mo each \= $30/mo total. |
| DNS Records | SPF, DKIM, DMARC configured on ALL domains. Non-negotiable. |
| Inbox Warmup | Use n8n automation or Instantly.ai. 2-3 weeks before first campaign. |
| Sending Volume | Start at 20/day per inbox. Scale to 50/day after warmup. 250/day total capacity. |
| Tracking | Custom tracking domain per workspace. No default link tracking. |

**B. Cold Email Sequences**

Each sequence is 4 touches over 14 days. Short. Direct. Value-first.

**Sequence 1: IT/MSP for Small Business**

| DAY | SUBJECT | CORE MESSAGE |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Day 1 | Quick question about \[Company\] IT | Noticed \[specific pain point\]. We helped a Phoenix print shop turn a $5K system into $50K revenue. Worth 15 min? |
| Day 3 | Re: Quick question | Following up. Most businesses overpay for IT that underdelivers. Happy to show what we found for similar companies. |
| Day 7 | Case study for \[Industry\] | Attached: how we secured systems for a company your size and cut downtime by 70%. Want the same playbook? |
| Day 14 | Last note | Not trying to be a pest. If IT isn't a priority right now, no worries. But if it is — reply and I'll send our free audit checklist. |

**Sequence 2: Cybersecurity / Compliance**

| DAY | SUBJECT | CORE MESSAGE |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Day 1 | \[Company\] \+ compliance risk | Most SMBs fail their first compliance audit. We've built systems for Pentagon-level security. Let me show you what that looks like at your scale. |
| Day 3 | Re: compliance risk | Following up. One compliance failure costs 10x what prevention costs. Happy to do a 15-min risk assessment. |
| Day 7 | The checklist most SMBs miss | Here's the 12-point security checklist we use. It's the same framework adapted from federal deployments. Free — no strings. |
| Day 14 | Closing the loop | If security is handled, great. If not, reply and I'll send a custom risk brief for \[Company\]. Takes 5 min to review. |

**Sequence 3: Web / Digital Presence**

| DAY | SUBJECT | CORE MESSAGE |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Day 1 | \[Company\] website — quick note | Looked at your site. A few quick fixes could significantly improve lead capture. Want me to send a free audit? |
| Day 3 | Re: website quick note | Following up. Most local businesses lose 30-50% of website visitors to poor load times alone. Worth a look. |
| Day 7 | Free audit attached | Ran a quick analysis on \[Company\].com. Found 3 things that could improve conversions. See attached. |
| Day 14 | Last one from me | No pressure. If you want to discuss the audit, I'm here. If not, best of luck — your \[product/service\] is solid. |

**C. Lead Sourcing**

| SOURCE | HOW TO USE |
| :---- | :---- |
| Apollo.io | Filter by industry, size, location. Export 200 leads/week. Verify emails before sending. |
| LinkedIn Sales Nav | Search by title \+ geography. Connect with personalized notes. Feed warm leads into email sequences. |
| Google Maps Scraping | Local businesses without websites or with bad ones \= instant prospects for web/IT services. |
| Referrals (Kelsey's network) | Brad, Alex, Rolling Landscape, sign shop. Warm intros \= 3-5x close rate vs cold. |
| Local BNI / Chamber | Show up. Shake hands. Be the IT/cyber guy in the room. One referral partner \= monthly pipeline. |

**D. Kelsey — Phase 2**

*"Is the reward for ihsan (excellence) anything but ihsan?" (55:60)*

Kelsey is not just a client. Kelsey is proof of concept. Phase 1 demonstrated you can deliver. Phase 2 is where you prove you can scale and retain.

| Referrals | 4 warm referrals identified: Brad, Alex, Rolling Landscape, sign shop |

**E. LinkedIn Presence**

| POST TYPE | EXAMPLE ANGLE |
| :---- | :---- |
| Case Study | "How a $5K system deployment turned into $50K revenue for a local print shop." |

| Engagement Bait | "What's the biggest IT frustration for your business? Drop it below — I'll reply to every one." |

**III. FITNESS — THE BODY IS AN AMANAH**

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

*"Indeed, your body has a right over you." — Prophet Muhammad ﷺ*

You already train hard. 200 bench. 240 deadlift. 6 days a week. The foundation is iron. Now we optimize.

*"Eat and drink, but be not excessive. Indeed, He does not like those who commit excess." (7:31)*

Simple. Repeatable. No decision fatigue. Pick from the options. Cook Sunday. Eat all week.

**Meal 1 Options (Post-Training / Morning)**

| OPTION | MEAL | MACROS (APPROX) |

**V. SPIRITUAL OPERATING SYSTEM**

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

*"Verily, in the remembrance of Allah do hearts find rest." (13:28)*

This is not a side quest. This is the foundation everything else is built on. Without this, the business is just hustle and the gym is just vanity. With this, every rep is ibadah, every email is rizq-seeking, every meal is fuel for purpose.

**Daily Non-Negotiables**

| PRACTICE | DETAIL |
| :---- | :---- |
| Fajr ON TIME | This is the anchor. If Fajr slips, everything slips. Set 2 alarms. Do wudu immediately. |
| 5 Daily Salawat | All 5\. On time. No combining without valid reason. This is your direct line. |
| Morning Adhkar | After Fajr. 5-10 minutes. SubhanAllah x33, Alhamdulillah x33, Allahu Akbar x34. Ayat al-Kursi. |
| Evening Adhkar | After Maghrib. Same format. Add the 3 Quls. Protection for the night. |
| Istighfar (100x daily) | Sunnah of the Prophet ﷺ. "Astaghfirullah" 100x. Throughout the day. Clears the path. |
| Quran — 1 Page Minimum | Every single day. If you can do a juz, do a juz. But 1 page is the floor, never zero. |
| Dua Before Work | "Bismillah, tawakkaltu 'ala Allah." Before you open the laptop. Every time. |

**Weekly Spiritual Anchors**

| DAY | PRACTICE |
| :---- | :---- |
| Thursday Night | Extra salawat on the Prophet ﷺ. Increase istighfar. Prepare for Jumu'ah. |
| Friday (Jumu'ah) | Surah Al-Kahf. Ghusl. Early arrival. Best clothes. Extra dua in the last hour before Maghrib. |
| Sunday | Weekly reflection. What did I do this week for my akhirah? Adjust. Reset. Recommit. |

**Quranic Anchors for Execution**

Memorize these. Internalize them. They are your operating system.

*"Whoever has taqwa of Allah, He will make a way out for him, and provide for him from where he does not expect." (65:2-3)*

*"If you are grateful, I will surely increase you." (14:7)*

*"Indeed, with hardship comes ease." (94:6)*

*"And We have certainly made the Quran easy to remember. So is there anyone who will be mindful?" (54:17)*

*"So verily, with hardship, there is relief. Verily, with hardship, there is relief." (94:5-6)*

*"And your Lord says, Call upon Me; I will respond to you." (40:60)*

**VI. WEEKLY SCORECARD**

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

*"Take account of yourselves before you are taken to account." — Umar ibn al-Khattab (RA)*

Every Sunday night. Score yourself. Be honest. No one is watching but Allah.

**VIII. THE FINAL WORD**

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

*"By time, indeed mankind is in loss — except those who believe, do righteous deeds, advise each other to truth, and advise each other to patience." (103:1-3)*

You secured Pentagon networks that protected missions. You built NATO infrastructure. You integrated systems across 15 embassies on 4 continents. You deployed a $5K system that enabled $50K in revenue for a Phoenix printing company. You train 6 days a week with 200 on bench and 240 on deadlift.

You are not someone who lacks ability. You are someone who has been building in silence when you should have been executing in public. The system is ready. The sequences are written. The leads are found. The proposal is sent. The proof exists.

The only thing left is to move.

**Bismillah. Strike like Musa (AS). Move like Ibrahim (AS).**

"Indeed, with hardship comes ease." (94:6) — Not after. WITH.
