7. Click **"Save User"** to send the invitation

*Note: Only existing admin users can access the Manage Team page.*

#### 2. Quo Phone System Setup

**What we need from you to set up Quo:**

**Account Creation (you do this):**
- [ ] Sign up at quo.com (formerly OpenPhone)
- [ ] Select Business Plan (~$23/user/month annual, ~$33 monthly)
- [ ] Add our team as users so we can configure

**How to add our team (step-by-step):**
1. Go to **Settings → Members**
2. Click **"Invite your team"** or **"Invite a member"**
3. Enter team member's email address
4. For phone number assignment, select **"Share existing"** (we'll configure later)
5. Select role: **"Admin"**
6. Click to send invitation

*Admin permissions include: manage team members, configure integrations, update phone number settings, submit port requests.*

**For Number Porting (from Vonage):**
- [ ] Vonage account number
- [ ] Authorized account holder name
- [ ] Phone number to port: _______________

**How to find Vonage account number:**
1. Sign in to Vonage Admin Portal: **admin.vonage.com**
2. Click **"Billing"** in the menu
3. Account number appears on invoices (download any invoice to view)
4. Or check **Account Details** section in the portal

**PIN Note:** Vonage does NOT require a PIN to port out. If Quo asks for one, use any 4 digits (e.g., last 4 of phone number, "1234", or "0000").

**Important:** Don't cancel Vonage until the port completes. Phone numbers cannot transfer once an account is canceled.

## LATER (Phase 1 Buffer / Phase 2 Prep)

---

#### 3. Plotter Setup & Maintenance Videos

**What:** As many videos as possible of Kelce walking through:
- Plotter setup procedures
- Maintenance walkthroughs
- Troubleshooting processes
- Any training content that exists

**Why:**
- Build your knowledge base
- Create SOPs from real expertise
- Foundation for training future techs

**How to share:**
- [ ] Google Drive link, OR
- [ ] Dropbox folder, OR
- [ ] YouTube unlisted links (if already uploaded), OR
- [ ] Upload to shared folder we create

**Note:** Kelce mentioned having YouTube videos with "hundreds of thousands of views" on HP printer topics - those count too!

#### 4. Email Access (Kelce + Alyssa)

**What:** Access to both inboxes
**Why:**
- Understand communication patterns
- Identify vendor pricing emails for automation
- See what's falling through the cracks

**Options:**
- [ ] Add us as delegates in Gmail/Outlook, OR
- [ ] Provide login credentials, OR
- [ ] Forward access to a shared inbox we set up

**Whose inboxes:**
- [ ] Kelce's business email

**When needed:** After Quo is live

**Where to look:**
- [ ] Google Workspace / Google Drive
- [ ] Dropbox (Kelce mentioned "recently consolidated")

## Quick Win Sprint Access Handoff

**Chris will be on-site** to facilitate access setup directly.

**What we need from Kelce/Alyssa:**
1. Jobber admin invites sent to our team emails
2. Vonage account number (for porting - no PIN needed)
3. Quo account created at quo.io

Chris can walk through these steps in person to ensure handoff is complete.

Email access, plotter videos, and A2P registration can wait until after the quick win sprint.
