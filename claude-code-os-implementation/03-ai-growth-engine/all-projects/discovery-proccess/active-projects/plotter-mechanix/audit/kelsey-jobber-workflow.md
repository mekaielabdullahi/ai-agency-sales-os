## Kelsey's Workflow Description (His Words)

### Typical Flow: Straight to Job (Bypassing Request/Quote)

> "Normally the workflow is it goes straight to a job because when I'm talking to somebody like I'm already planning on doing the job, like, and so there's a little bit of a problem there because I tell Alyssa to make it a job. But they haven't got a quote yet. I'll make it a job and then they're like, well, we haven't got a quote yet. And that's like, oh yeah, hang on, now she got to go back and make a quote and send it to him." - Kelsey

**The Problem:**
> "And then we got to delete my job that I made because it doesn't flow through otherwise, you know what I mean? Then you got like a quote and a job that aren't connected to each other and you can't reconnect them." - Kelsey

**Why It Happens:**
> "It's mostly a job unless it needs to be a quote, you know, like if I'm talking to people and they say, oh, I want to get a new graph tech, then I'm, I sent her a message. I'll be like, Hey, Alyssa, we need to send pro whatever a quote on an FC 9000-160. And then she's done that enough times that she knows what that means and then she just goes and makes it." - Kelsey

## How Information Gets Into Jobber

### Method 1: Kelsey Calls Alyssa

> "As soon as it becomes a job, I like to turn it into a job and get it on the schedule. So Alyssa's just taking my text messages I give her. I call her on the phone, she writes down no, she puts it in there." - Kelsey

### Method 2: Customer Emails

> "Customer's email supplies or service or whatever, you know, sometimes that comes in like that." - Kelsey

### Method 3: Jobber Direct Texting (New)

> "Sometimes they are texting jobber directly now that I'm teaching them how to do that." - Kelsey

> "I'm really trying to concentrated effort here recently since Jobber added that the text, the picture feature, which they didn't have all this time. It made it difficult for me to use it because I couldn't communicate with people the way I normally do, so I kept reverting back to my personal, but since they got the picture thing, I've really been adamantly like if somebody emails me or texts me, I go straight to Jobber and I'm like, hey" - Kelsey

**How He Uses It:**
> "A lot of times I'll just send the customer a message from Jobber, and then I mark it unread just so that she hopefully notices that I, there's an unread text message with a message from me going to somebody" - Kelsey (marking his own messages unread so Alyssa sees them)

### Method 4: Screenshot Bombing

> "I'll take screenshots of my phone, conversation that I'm texting with them, and I'll just shoot it over to her." - Kelsey

> "I take screenshots of my phone, conversation that I'm texting with them, and I'll just shoot it over to her office phone that she has, my other Verizon number, and then As she, I try and do it like during the night or early in the morning, so I don't bother her cell phone. And then when she comes in, she, she's getting bombarded with like the inbox, all the text messages I sent her and then like, she's, you know Going through all that stuff and sorting it out" - Kelsey

---

## Requests Feature (Barely Used)

> "Well, the only time that request happens is if the customer physically goes to my website and fills out that form online, but I don't like the way the form is. It's too complicated, so I don't try and tell people to go there, but they do occasionally fill it out. So that's a request, or we can make a request" - Kelsey

> "But it usually starts as a quote. Or a job." - Kelsey

---

## Quote Workflow

### When Quotes Are Needed:

> "If I'm talking to people and they say, oh, I want to get a new graph tech, then I'm, I sent her a message. I'll be like, Hey, Alyssa, we need to send pro whatever a quote on an FC 9000-160." - Kelsey

**Alyssa's Process:**
> "She'll call me and say like how much I charge for your install fee because she doesn't know if it's in California or across the street or whatever, so she usually kind of coordinates with me on how to quote it, and then we send it" - Kelsey

### Follow-Up Problem:

> "And then the follow-ups kind of messed up in Jobber because it doesn't remind me to follow up on my quotes. So if I don't physically make a task to follow up on a quote that I sent, and I'm not deliberately going to check the quotes. I have to have her like make a task for me to follow up on the quote tomorrow because For some reason, a open quote doesn't go on your calendar. On tasks, only visits go on there, which are part of a job and not part of a quote." - Kelsey

**The Workaround:**
> "So the only thing that shows up on the physical calendar is a visit that you create. You can make a job But if you don't make it a visit and add a person to it in a time, then it's just an open job floating around out there which there's a filter that shows it to us so we know if we forget to do a step or whatever like it does a good job at rounding all the stuff together so you have a bird's eye view of like what you have an invoice and what you haven't, you know, draft quotes and all that you could filter by like stuff that you haven't sent yet that you're working on." - Kelsey

## Job vs Visit Confusion

### Jobs Without Visits:

> "You can make a job But if you don't make it a visit and add a person to it in a time, then it's just an open job floating around out there" - Kelsey

### The Calendar Issue:

> "So the only thing that shows up on the physical calendar is a visit that you create." - Kelsey

### Alyssa's Workarounds:

**Note Location Strategy:**
> "Like where do you put the notes at, you know, because you can put the notes on the job or you can put them on the person, you know, and like if I'm in the job, I don't want to have to go look for the person to find the guy's number, you know, these are things we've been learning like there's a note section there where Alyssa on the visit I have, it's not the job, but the actual visit. She'll copy and paste the person's phone number and name right there for me so I can just grab it because otherwise I have to go back and figure out who am I supposed to be calling right now" - Kelsey

**Visit vs Job Structure:**
> "The way Jobber works is they have the visit, which is what he sees on his cell phone. He clicks on it. The visit is pretty much the first thing that pops up, so that's the thing that's on the calendar at the top, but the notes are a separate thing. You have to click a different tab in order to get into the notes to see all the information and that's OK because it's all inside of that visit. The visit and the job are connected, so the notes stay with it, but not everything does." - Kelsey

## Documentation & Invoicing Process

### Kelsey's Field Documentation:

> "I try and keep my camera available and I take pictures of what I'm doing while I'm doing it, and then I, I feel like it gives the customer a better, presentation when they go to get the invoice to pay you and it shows all the shit that we did, you know." - Kelsey

**When It Breaks Down:**
> "And if I don't see any notes on there because sometimes you're rushing around, you're too busy, you don't put notes. I have to call you. I have to say, Hey, what did you do on this job? How long did it take?" - Kelsey

### Kelsey's Documentation Process:

> "Sometimes I don't put my notes in there, and I have to physically do that, you know, I have to stop. I have to go in there. I have to go to notes. I have to add my pictures, then I've got to, you know, I just Dictate a message of what I did basically save it, complete the job, and then she gets a reminder that I need to be invoiced" - Kelsey

**Time Tracking:**
> "And it has a timer on it too, but I usually confirm my hours with her before because the timer's not perfect and since I updated my phone, it doesn't seem to be working at all right now actually, but it's not 100%, but it does help when I go somewhere and I lose track of time" - Kelsey

## What Kelsey Wants from Jobber

### The Ideal Morning:

> "I use the Jobber like I in an ideal world when I come in the morning, I wouldn't be looking at my inbox or my text messages or any of that shit because that happened yesterday. You know, this is today. Like I want to, I want to look at Jobber look at all the jobs that need to be done, and then come in with that in mind if I'm going to come in here and get this shit together and I'm going to head out, you know, and then during the day while all that shit's happening, we're hopefully handling it that day so that tomorrow I'm not trying to figure out what happened yesterday and the day before. That's, that's really what keeps pulling my attention away" - Kelsey

### Jobber as Single Source of Truth:

> "I heard you guys say earlier like Jobber is going to be the sole source of the answers or whatever. Yeah, and like, I think that's probably what that would be the best approach for sure. it just doesn't have all of these." - Kelsey

**The Trust Issue:**
> "I don't use it as much as I could because I don't fully trust it I guess. I, I don't fully trust that everything is in there, but I do, I, I lean on it hard, you know, like, I mean, I come in the morning and then I look at my schedule and I look at what I'm doing, Joe's doing." - Kelsey

> "My first instinct is not to go to Jobber and look for the information I need. It's to go into my text messages and my inbox and like Alyssa's getting better and putting notes in there, like she's got lots of notes in there, but they're more for her purposes and I wouldn't say I'm necessarily gleaning a lot from her entering all this information in their notes for herself to keep track of things" - Kelsey

## Current Jobber Workarounds

### Department Users (Kelsey's System):

> "I always overcomplicate everything. So in Jobber I created additional users. So if you look in there, there's a service that supplies of sales and a printing one, and those are like departments basically. So like, I don't like to see everything that's on the service schedule on my calendar. If I'm not physically doing it, it's overwhelming when I see 15 things on Monday morning on my calendar. Like, I don't want to see the 3 or 4 things I really have to do. And then the other things that are in service are like waiting on parts, waiting on the customer, you know, whatever, and like we're having to push that stuff ahead." - Kelsey

### Keeping It Clean:

> "The quoting follow through thing is really good, especially if you use it, you know, if you sit down like if you really deliberately say, oh, I'm going to go through check my quotes today, you know, like, or whatever, like it's all right there in front of you and then you can complete them and close them out and like, we've done the best job that I think of not letting it turn into a pile of shit like my QuickBooks. Like everything in there is up to date and fairly current." - Kelsey

---

## Contact Management Issues

### Recent Jobber Update (Multiple Contacts per Company):

> "That's another thing that happened here recently, guys. Just real quick, I just thought about it. The way it handles contacts. Didn't used to allow you to have a company and then have multiple contacts within it. So that just happened recently. And so we were having to go from using capsule where everything was accompanied with contacts in it to using this, which was just like a person or some shit. I don't even know how they were doing it, but now it's actually a company and you can add additional contacts under it." - Kelsey

**The Legacy Confusion:**
> "So before that we made a whole bunch of custom fields in there, and it's confused the hell out of me, man. Plotter Contact one, plotter Contact 2, and I don't think that the ones that are on the job are the same ones that are on the visit or the company I think they're different layers of confusion or something. I don't really know." - Kelsey

## What Works Well

> "I, I mean, Jobber is actually really helpful. I mean, like... I, I lean on it hard, you know, like, I mean, I come in the morning and then I look at my schedule and I look at what I'm doing, Joe's doing." - Kelsey

> "Like everything in there is up to date and fairly current. Like my old CRM has 5000 tasks I didn't finish. And it's just that it just already got so big of a task. I was just basically working for my CRM all day. I was like, what the fuck is this? This isn't helping me. So since we moved away from that into this, it's been a lot more." - Kelsey

> "I can't really think of what would be better about it besides our lack of being able to communicate with each other. I don't think it's Jobber that's the problem though. It's just that process of how we do it, you know" - Kelsey

## Key Takeaways

1. **Bypasses Request workflow** - Goes straight to Jobs
2. **Quote/Job disconnect** - Can't reconnect if created separately
3. **Visits are calendar items** - Jobs without visits are "floating"
4. **Manual follow-ups** - Must create tasks, quotes don't auto-remind
5. **Trust issue** - Doesn't fully trust Jobber has everything
6. **Screenshot workaround** - Texts screenshots to Alyssa instead of using Jobber messaging
7. **Recent adoption of Jobber texting** - Since picture feature added
8. **Department users workaround** - Created fake users to filter calendar views
9. **Contact confusion** - Legacy custom fields from pre-company feature
10. **Notes scattered** - Job notes vs Visit notes vs Person notes

## The Core Problem (Kelsey's Insight)

> "I don't think it's Jobber that's the problem though. It's just that process of how we do it, you know, like... we don't have that process in place. Like I make the process up every time I do it, and therefore causing chaos and confusion. So like I'm diligently going to try and implement whatever process you put in place" - Kelsey

**The Vision:**
> "Jobber is going to be the sole source of the answers... I think that's probably what that would be the best approach for sure." - Kelsey

**But currently:**
> "My first instinct is not to go to Jobber and look for the information I need. It's to go into my text messages and my inbox" - Kelsey

---

**Next Steps:** Design proper Request → Quote → Job → Visit → Invoice workflow that aligns with Kelsey's reality while leveraging Jobber's intended design.
