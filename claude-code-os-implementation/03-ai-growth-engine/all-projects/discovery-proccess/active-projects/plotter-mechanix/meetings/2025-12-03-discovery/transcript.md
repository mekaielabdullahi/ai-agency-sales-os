is like dude you tell me what you know I have some questions that I can
ultimately start having you look at you like well I get set up so these are
pretty much this kind of the script of what I'm gonna stick to the whole point
of why we're doing this is a for me to learn how to interview a business owner
in a way like I'm all I'm trying to do is understand the story of your
business the story of the problems you occur every day ultimately if we pursue
that type of I don't want to say interview but that process of just telling the
story right that's kind of my approach to ultimately provide you the
resources and as far as the integrations the communications all that kind of
stuff so where's that job at
I'll show you what I do I'll show you how I basically what I'm doing so
you see that looks killer bro I love that and then it's the back he sent me a
proof earlier where the fist was right in the center and it was right across the
whole car and I kind of like that better but I also I told him to put all that
latex btf shit on the on the roof rack thing because people are gonna stare at
that thing on my roof on the traffic oh yeah like put so let go around it
with like bullet points at an angle or something I don't I don't know if there
was a way to put that right there oh dude I think like having that up on the
top of the roof I think that might be pretty cool I should you could have it in
there twice but originally it had it across the back of the whole trunk oh yeah
like it was like right here like towards a license plate right yeah right like
the wrist was like right at the bottom of the trunk and like a whole boom across
there but I was like and I I wanted to give me that I wanted to move that shit up
to the car carrier because that's where people are gonna be staring at my
traffic right right right and at my car and they'll be able to read it just like
the key words like I put like I don't I don't really know how to do it by put
latex dtpdg solvent you curable aquis resin like all the key words that people
would know in the industry you know I mean if you don't know what that means I
mean you don't know what I do it really matter right and I got my little barcode
there so they could take a picture of people that you know are savvy to that stuff
and hyperlinks are the way to go so I've I created a new logo I want I want
you to see it but let me see oh yeah dude that's fire so yeah I wonder is that
an HHR I'm no it's a silent oh is it a sign I'm gonna I'm gonna probably second
surface wrap the car carrier you know I mean to put the decals up there
like the information and I might do the logos of the companies in color on
there mmm like where it says cannon make a pop a little bit like you go
do you talk about these ones yeah but I can put those on after I do the
wrap well wouldn't you use for HP HP would be blue right so use like their logos
yeah I moved those blue graphics blue cannons red yeah I think that would pop off
like almost like a race car you know put all your sponsors on there so I might
put that on the on the roof rack up top or I like I kind of like it looks across
the bottom of lower across like the the kit panel yeah I like it on the lower
like like yeah if you make them a little bigger along the bottom there yeah that's
what like I can put like a white stroke around the outside it is so kind of pops
out of there yep so how is your Adobe so cycle going like because before you had
Lee in taking all of the artwork that I submitted through Adobe is are you
guys able to start or like still do like so let's say if you have a random
person who created their artwork in Adobe can you help them modify the
document to get to print ready of whatever they're
do Joe's pretty good at this that's what I was trying to say Joe like we saw this guy
a printer he had a cutter and I was like oh that's a shit Joe like that's the same
when I got in my house house like oh yeah I forgot dude because they have a bunch
of cheap as Chinese tool that there's a dude they he's got a Chinese
bender for making like channel letters and shit you know how to run all that
stuff he saw he saw this machine that was like 10 12 feet long yesterday and
he was like oh I could run that I was like damn dude I don't even know what that is
no shit yeah and then like we went to this guy's office yesterday and I was like the
guy called me out because he wanted to trade me for my printer for his bus that
asked one and I'm like and then give me some broken laminor so I get I you know
I get in courtesy of stopping by well on the way there he's like oh dude maybe
you know my printer you know like I'm having all these problems I got this
rat I got to try wrap these cars I got to fix a panel I can get to match and so
I'm like okay well this is kind of turning to a service called this point I
mean so I go over there and I look at the situation I'm like look bro I go
this original shit you pray is wrong like you were missing a color of
print he's like yeah but it looks cool dude I go I don't give a shit but to
recreate something that looks cool when your printer was running off of you
know a missing channel of a print head you let your lack of percent of your
blackout look at your black text it's like blue yeah be liked it and I was like
well recreate that shit good luck dude not even perfect my expert but I zoomed
in on it and showed it to him like like you showed him the pixel counts well
just take it like look at this man I believe I see yeah right there
these are the two colors and I'm like this this is it's not from a distance but
up close oh yeah look how much bleed there is right is that what you're looking at
everything looks like shit but just look at look at this is that this is what it
looks like so you got like some cyan magenta yellow some greens you know but
you don't see a lot of black I mean there's there's a there's blacks in
their black so that's how you're determining that quality that's what he
liked oh but this is what he was getting and what is that again why is this
just zoom in this is what everything looks like oh so this is just the
great and then you use your use your camera to kind of well I'm just looking at it
just saying look at the way this looks like see how dark that is like more more
there's no white in the background you see how it's just all color if you look
at this one over here there's lots of vacant space in the back you know
I mean like white areas right where the other one just flooded with ink so
like I'm at how he created that color who knows man like you just got to start
guessing and making sure he's trying to like match a panel like they did the panel
wrong where the where the text is lined up like this on the doors uh-huh he's
got to redo the panel well now he's gonna have to match that color in the
center and it's gonna look like shit like you're gonna have to do the whole back
of the man you know to get it to look where this guy that just spent three or
four thousand dollars and he's gonna shit his pants and he looks at it oh my
gosh he's got three partially done wraps and the guy's stressing out you know
it's like not my fault but I spent an hour by time there looking at his
broken fucking laminators while he's asking me for advice and I tell him telling
him you know I go look dude he's like I go just work with Michael dude like I
go Michael better than I am at this anyway he said yeah but he's busy dude I go
well he got to wait for his ass dude like you know like I don't know how often do
you uh come in those scenarios
daily that's cool yeah yeah yeah I'm doing an install for a guy that right now
today you know he's paying me a thousand bucks to do an install on an
else it's crazy but some guy and Scott still wants somebody to hand
deliberate into his house into this funky situation really yeah I don't have a
problem doing it and now that I got personal oh that's the one you were talking
about earlier right Joe Joe so Joe he jumped in on that guy's computer
started to eat in the color bar and within like two tries had his closest
anything that guy got in hours that's so we leave and I charged him you know I
go tell this I go to service go I've only got pictures we got proof we did all
this stuff and the guy just hits his pants and I still have to get back to him
because I just now I know what I'm dealing with like somebody who
appreciated what I did and came out there and you know right I go look you know
here's the deal dude like the first thing is next time before you print a
document do a nozzle check to make sure your machine's up hard so that you
can recreate this shit later on like I mean so you're so if your machine is
running at top notch and you print a wrap right right at HP and you come back
with two months later and do it again it's it's not it's really gonna look
identical dude so is there like God is it because people just don't know
do you think or like why what makes wow this easy he's just ignorant beyond the
fact that once you set up a printer he works like he's like he's like who looks
he looks good so I was like well it doesn't look right I was like look at
your monitor and look at what you look look what you gave the guy like he still
look right but this with your monitor and what you're
printing out over here they look a lot of like you know you're trying to make
what's on the monitor look like not what it's coming out of the printer and
that's not I mean I've got on the tools to figure it out but I don't know how to
use them dude like spectra partometers and I have a $3,000 spectra that I
what's a spectra it's a it's a media profiler
and is it a tool it's a it's a it's a camera dude it's a color camera that
takes a picture of the color and gives a gives you a value of that color
and then where's the output go to that like is it just like a like is it
give you like a grade or like you create a profile so like HP's actually
have a built-in spectra partometer in them oh really yeah okay HP
their print head drips all over the place so they have they have always had a
way to self-calibrate since the beginning so if you're the alignments they're
self-calibrate. Morning!
What's that?
Oh lemony yeah oh yeah I gotta go show him what he is his lamp.
Do it dude you guys find let me get prepped do you
do me I'll stop the recordings no worries yeah yeah let me go over there and help
yeah do you want me to take the mic off for a second you can go over there and make
a video about it for real awesome let me do it make a video I'm I sold this guy
this am here I'm gonna show him what he's right now cool you already got
that's bitches who did that for you uh Lushdub Media yeah check it out dude I'm
gonna I'm gonna see look you're already promoting him bro I'm getting my self
since I have all the machines but he designed it right I'm gonna change
it who's gonna lay it down uh probably Gus at the end of the
speak down here because Lushdub is really good man this guy Lushdub and Gus
worked together like yeah so I just fixed his printer form recently and so I'm
like let me use you to design my rap because you he's he's talented so I couldn't
get a good job but I mean I'm just working with the guy because I'm trying to
promote him too you know like I'm taking his money so I'm like
you know all right well let's go do you say event
yeah what kind of event oh is that up there in Scottsdale
how are you doing Chris
oh you know there's somebody else in me I thought he was with him what'd you say there's
somebody else in it
you're your your name's Mike right
oh man
yeah things have progressed fairly quickly for me I actually so the reason
why I was doing the media stuff was to get my foot in the door with clients
oh
anyways the reason why I was doing that is because I uh developed an idea for software
right you're telling me that and so then I uh got involved with this AI agency
to learn how to develop it my first week I found a group of developers
okay and now we have all four of us have teamed up and now it looks like we're starting
a legit agency now and we're just focusing on just like do it's been less than a week but we
already have our all our environment set up right and now we're starting to figure out how the
onboarding works and um yeah so we're just sticking to pretty much basic CRM type applications
to really just start capturing every single lead that comes through anybody that's what we're
focusing on starting there but ultimately plan will be to develop um custom your own custom
software and it's not as expensive as it is what it used to be right and uh yeah so just trying
to figure out how that looks for each client so there was a guy who popped up at Kelsey's office
right when we were walking out so yeah it's been uh it's been interesting interesting turn
of events
let me go get my coffee real quick
it's me
actually while you're doing that I want to create a you'll see
well but I do want something happen like for you okay let me know if he's worth
I'm gonna call you yeah call me either way and let me know man because I need to know I've got a
pie I got a contact I've been too busy bro to just dig down on it a listen to trying to figure it out
but I know she sent a whole bunch of them back because it was doing the same thing to other people
I don't I have the same machine you have next door and I can test yours in there I just
have time to do it right now because and it doesn't matter if it works in mine it doesn't work in yours
yeah I'll have her test those in mine I'll let you know you test those in here to let me know
do you need a hand Kelsey? Do you need a hand with anything?
okay I'm gonna take a I'm gonna create a 3d picture a model of your building if that's okay
yeah then I'll be over there okay
oh no
dude that was a hard fall
I mean you don't want all this you don't have to do all this every time you go to use it
you know I don't need like your environment sucks so you guys just do what you gotta do
I don't like covers because I don't like put them on take it along
okay so I mean here we can do is on how to read look at this structure I've got to get it yeah so
there you go
is it under here right?
it difficult to sit down
it's getting in there
if you need a pass where there's loads of legislative
So yeah, the slamming is the only thing that makes me down.
So what I like to do, I don't have my thing anymore, but I used to have a trimmer where
I could probably do it when you pull the back or back here, and then you slice it up
with that.
I know.
But I had one that was really thin.
I got another thing.
I have one of those too.
Cool.
So what I like to do, and what I like about the slamming is, oh yeah, that's terrible.
That cut my light meter the first day, I had it, they rolled over the wheel, and
printed the power cord out of the back.
This is a pedal.
It's like a pedal.
You're up with that thing when you're done with this man, and we'll see that.
I would just pick it up and set it up there, man, because you roll over it back and
it'll rip it out of the back if you need it.
Oh, nice, oh yeah, that's fun.
I did part of it.
So that's perfect.
So look at it.
You want to take the material, wrap it over that roll, and get it going back this way,
okay.
Pull that back here, and then you can just, like, when you're loading the media in the
printer, whatever, like, you can find it here, or not find it up.
I'm not that far yet.
You have to take it out yet.
But you want to, you definitely, if you're looking to spin those, they've all gone.
Numbers on.
I've seen, I've seen, I've seen, I've seen, I've seen, I've seen, I've seen, I've seen,
before I go with it around the slamming.
I don't know.
It's 70 there, and this is 70.
It's the same on those sides.
It looks right.
So, if you set these all to 70, then you're going to be at least in the right ballpark.
You take a, it's a little bit skewed right here, but that doesn't really matter what
matters.
You'll be taken on it, and then you get a square.
It's a little bit skewed right here, but that doesn't really matter what matters,
you'll be taken on it at least.
Well, there you go, so it's six times bigger though.
Well, there needs to be a magic in the room.
But it has to spread their abs down to each other anyway.
So you can get eight more.
So, sixty-nine is where you want to put it.
Okay, here, here, here, and also with your take up drill over here.
That's where the echo of the power of that, that's where they sound.
Okay cool.
Anyway, look, if you get back here and you can see all the materials,
like, I'm squaring it up right there.
See what I pull up to left because that way, right?
Like, there's a certain spot where, you know, like it's touching all the way across there.
So, it's through the hole there from the center.
Okay, and then I hit the lift butt back here and drop the pressure.
That way, now, it's not going to be able to move.
Okay, and when I pull on it, when I pull it back on it,
I pull this so that it doesn't get up.
That applies to the brakes.
They cause this to lock up for it if you can.
You know, your pull on right there, so you want to hit this,
it's not stuck there.
You also have this brake.
So, you pull to see how this lets the brake going on here.
Go back there and feel it.
So, at the time, you push your arm out and you do it.
Like, grab that paper, pull on it.
Keep your hands and feel how it feels.
And I think that the brake should be a little stronger,
like maybe you've got to feel something.
Now, more.
Like, brake.
Feel that.
Feel that.
See that here?
Now, feel this.
Do, like, come over here and feel how tight that thing is right now.
Now, twist it.
Right here.
Feel that pressure.
Yeah.
You need to have pressure back, but not too much.
You're going to curl the media up like when it comes out.
You've got too much.
You're going to have fingers.
What that does is it keeps the tongue on the roll.
And it also keeps it going straight.
You know, and it ain't because, without that back pressure,
it'll start to walk around.
Okay.
So, send it right up over there.
I can show you the whole pressure.
Like I said, if you can back it up, you don't want to waste your material.
You know, I think so.
Now, watch.
Walk it back and forth on that on the table.
That's the right watch out.
Slide down the roll.
Let me see the light.
Let me see the light.
Feel it?
Yeah.
So, find that center point and hit the lift button over there.
Okay.
It's hard to work with.
You've got a lot of tapeless pressure.
I found that that clear tape works pretty good.
Back and tape.
Yeah.
Sometimes it works as a backer better than the table.
So, there's three different pieces to one laminate.
Is that what this is?
There's only two pieces to it.
But this is the backer right here.
So, this is going to take the backer up.
So, he doesn't have to deal with it.
Got it.
So, that's okay.
Once we get it going, it'll be all right.
So, now that you have it locked down tight,
it's a little blade right here.
It's that right here.
You can take it back flat right here a little bit,
just don't slide the roll.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.

## chris_DJI_01_20251202_211932

I have to show you my new logo bro I want I made for my brand oh yeah you
Should let's go look at her in oh shit the blade thought the same girl
Yeah
So even if you're off by an ink of an answer so you start
Swear itself up dude okay within the first few feet all right our few inches
Thank you, and you can manually put pressure on it, too
I think it's cool. I was like oh school
Yeah, it's talking me him a little bit
Dude I want to try to figure out a way like is there anything in job or that you hate that you wish it would do but it doesn't
Well start thinking about that
Okay, well if there's something that you need it to do and it doesn't do let me know and I can
That's the things that I'm looking for those types of shit
I don't want to sit down with you. I'm done. I'm done. You're good
Dude if we need a reschedule like don't even trip like I'm in your business. What'd you say?
Can you go put it in my car?
You
See like this is exactly what I'm talking about
His office lady just got in
It looks like she controls the flow of the service calls
She told Kelsey yesterday that he needs to bring a roll of 24 inch paper and he forgot
And this is the thing
I
Got it since we're gonna be removing that printer and putting this printer and I didn't want to set it up
Who sits here at this computer?
That's my desk. Oh
Okay, can I put this over here then? Yeah, cool. Just it's over there
Hey, I got your printer load up in the back of my truck. I was gonna put it together this morning
But I'm just gonna put it together there since we got to put it on that
So I'm already to go but I got a few things I got to do on this side of town before I leave
So probably gonna not leave you're for like an hour. So I think it's 930 right now
Is that like a phone call oh, that's fine
Oh, I can just leave and you can have your meeting I can come back
15
Yeah, that's cool. I mean we can step out while you had your meetings by now. I don't want to
Okay
Yeah, no, this printer said he said oh man, I was shocked
So I just put it in the back of the printer
We'll figure it out I got bring in a guy with me too, so
Yeah, okay, all right, man. Okay, bye
Good on time sweet so I was like reflecting last night and
Do you know we've known each other for almost three years dude crazy, right? I know
Yeah, so you just moved to this shop like right around that same time because the met you sent me an address to the old shop
That was like by Walmart or something
So this is job
Yes, so I
I was Joe was walking me through that and he said the map is a really handy feature actually them and
Bring this over here. So I
When I sit here and look at this I'm overbooked for the day
See how it says unscheduled unscheduled there's a filter I can turn that off. So we have a unscheduled
Thing that goes to the things that are out of town. So show unscheduled
So how do you like jobber? I mean, I
Like it for this reason right here like this is my day like the way that we use it. I've got these filters over here, right?
so
We each have a person and then we have a division so like
Anything that has to do with me is usually going to service so I can filter the schedule
But not see everything on my schedule like this is all that's on my list for the day of things I got to do
I got a city of Glendale. I got installed this printer for the sky
When I pick on it, I can tell the sky hey, I'm on my way
You know, I just pick on this and however long a GPS tells me I hit saying dude
I said it's pretty legit so you know what you're saying I go here and I put I punch in directions
You know, so now I know it's gonna take me 50 minutes to get there. So you like the map integration is that your favorite tool?
No, what is you so you just like yeah, like so
I think you guys gotta hit back
Okay, so when I pull up it tracks my time
You like the geofence to clock in as it pulls up use the address for reference so it automatically clocks you in when you hit that
Geofence. Yeah, so like when I'm there. I'm looking at this. I've got my visit a list of puts my notes right here
So Robin suburbs my contact so I can check out. I want to right and this is what I'm doing. I got the install for 9.50
I got a processing key on there and
There's my team so Kelsey and servicer on there so like
Service like things I don't have to do right now that I'm working on I keep in the service schedule
I keep bumping them forward right and then I can just look at my Kelsey sketches. I don't get over a well feeling right
And then from right here the details this takes me to the company's information when we have like custom fields
The people I can go there address information right here. I can do most of the stuff from here
Like which everyone start is the one that's gonna get text from here. I could text the guy from right here
And then she can text him and we all can be texting right here. So I have okay, so got you so it pretty much creates a hub
To every all the text is all the messages get sent to everybody, but one
Central point if you call this phone number, right? You're texting it gets forward straight to my office got it
So you just get picked up. Yeah, you can call the number dial extension or you can text it and
In every sees pictures and all that. So I really I'm really like that
And then like so another thing I like about it
It's from the home view like as I'm as I'm finishing jobs and stuff like that like when I go to the stairs on the when I get when I get finish here
I complete the visit and it says invoice now or later
I say later because she puts my notes and she she's dealing with the billing and all that shit
So it goes into a queue basically of things that she still needs to do today like things that have been invoiced and so like at the end of every day
Like right Alyssa at the end of every day like if I say I completed a job
You have a list over there. You're looking at saying like this has to be invoiced. Yes
So at the end of the day you get his service list and then he just says while I'm doing it every time I leave a job
I call her and fill her in on it because I try and then you fill out the ticket. I'm trying to earn the loop of everything
I'm doing because her memory is not good and if I don't have she doesn't know idea what's going on at all
Right
So I try and like call her and explain to her what to do right right takes notes down then she's like okay
Now she's put together quotes for me that I got a review to send and like there's just
Ooh
Okay, this is cool though. This is exactly what I'm looking for so quick question when he sends you that report
You're writing them down, right?
I already like this is she's jotting them down quickly so she can but I like where are you jotting those at?
I'm okay cool. Awesome. Perfect
And then she transcribes it into job or and everything that we do I want it to be in job or so
We're gonna be doing something like I'm working on this printer next door the other thing I like about it is this right here
I didn't show you this I'm gonna cancel right here. So say I finish this job, but I'm not done
It's like the I need more parts. What I'll do is I'll come over here. I'll schedule a new visit for tomorrow
Mm-hmm
And then I can complete this visit so every time I showed up at this place
It's like a job and keep the track of the history of everything I did
So and then then when I come over here I have my notes
So what I'm doing the job I take a bunch of pictures and then I come in here and I add the note and I add all the
Pictures of all the work that we that was done. So where is the disconnect of this when you're entering this versus what you're sending Alyssa
No, I've already entered out my notes and shit. So but what then what are you sending to Alyssa that she's writing down on a sticky note?
So occasionally he calls when he's driving
Let her talk let her talk
So occasionally he calls when
He's tops of the client either over the phone or he's driving he can't do it himself
He calls he gives me all the information tells me okay, so I need you to make a quote
We need this for this client include this this and this I
Drop that down. I'm like, okay, cool. Bye. I'll get that done
Then I put it in
I so the way this onboarding system works and just so you know we have developed I started an agency to help
Efficient make things systems more efficient communication. So no, it's a difficult. So yeah, so yes
We're using AI, but AI is the sizzle. It ain't the steak, right?
I don't want to convict come like we are
AI consultants or AI
You know an agency, but ultimately what I'm trying to do is build your own software for
Kelsey and plotter mechanics. So this is exactly what I need so when you send her the tickets you're having to call
What does she doesn't answer what happens you leave a voicemail
She's very good at answering okay, but what do you prefer him leaving a voicemail versus you having to write it down
Okay, so then
How many times do you say out of five times he sends the invoice or information that you don't get it or you're away from your phone or something like is there a
A gap is there a gap where sometimes the information does again translate it correctly and now we filled out an
Invoicing correctly and we lost an opportunity. Is that ever happened often?
I mean not often
Maybe once it happens, but if he texts or he leads a voicemail and I don't understand I immediately call him
Sweet perfect. What is this? Okay cool awesome awesome
I have a difficult time communicating sometimes when I'm overwhelmed and what I
How do you like using your voice message like do you know how you can send a text message by recording yourself instead of I just I
Basically send text messages. Okay, um
Can you just try instead like do you know how to send a voice okay?
I
Work when we develop systems. I'm trying to get these AI voice agents
To do a lot of the heavy lifting. I think we talked about setting up a recorder here to trans like to record the office environment
So like for instance, yesterday she had told you about paper that you needed to put on the truck
Well that agent would have said hey Kelsey before you leave did you grab the paper for the truck from your job?
Yeah, I kind of stuff sounds cool to me. Yeah, so that but that's what I'm trying to say you know
Like I was a perfect instance this morning about what I'm trying to help you do so
I'm not I have to refrain from suggesting anything that we know about um
like
Managing the data because before you came along. There was a guy that was working with my church
Mm-hmm, and he was putting some API thing together in the back end that had on my dad. I think we
All my information because I have
We're and you paid five you paid like five grand for that right and where is that?
Do you have his information? Okay, would you uh
Would you be would you think it would be like a situation? Hey, hey, I am working for Kelsey
He asked me to reach out as a his consultant for this data set
Can we can we do that and you would I can work as that consultant for you? Yeah sweet. I think I think I can get him to
To help me at least
At least educate you on what you do. Yeah, like you film me up
You really have no idea. What do you spend seven grand? Yeah, so let me not let that go to waste
Let's use that as because I would be really curious to see what data sets he pulled already
Yeah, because they know he had access to everything like he was he was he was he was basically building a database and what I was going to connect
Shopify Java
Basically the whole back in there was going to be a portal that we would be able to get through yep, yep
and
Then we would start marketing and doing all this shit
But I saw any results. What happened with it? What happened? Stop paying in my every week. So because so because
I do that basically what happened is
I don't think that he understood the complexity of what I'm actually dealing with right upside with all the different
Right, which is a model number is all the information, right? So he said he could do it
But then since we built our website in properly from the get go
We didn't have the I don't know how they call it
But there's categories and they call it different things and we didn't have it that way for instance like we sell paper by the role
It comes in a two path
So you can the inventory management system kind of fucked up
Do you have an inventory management system Alyssa? No, so there's no inventory management system
Do you like it?
Yeah, they have a count of what's inside each box and a list our inventory system is garbage and that is
It doesn't work. I can't use it. It's completely unusable and I have no fucking clue of what I have in store sweet
And the system was already what do you use to manage your inventory nothing nothing so you say there's a spreadsheet or something right now
That's what I saw that board so I was curious about it because like I was like fuck if I rub my arm against the board
What am I wiping out?
Okay, cool. Okay, so
So
Guys, this is these are exactly what like I'm already thinking about creating
Again, I got a refrain from what I can create because I got to go to the developers right now like working with a bookkeeper your wife is what working with a bookkeeper
Okay, my taxes and shit in line
And starting January 1st we're starting with a fresh clean quick books
Oh, so you have your reconciled reconciled your books
Okay, I just reconciled dude like a $700,000 difference
In our quick books. It was fucking crazy dude like holy shit. I didn't know how hard it was to reconcile your fucking books
Yeah, okay, so this is all good shit anyways. She's dealing with that. So January we're gonna start over from scratch and I want to
I got all these printers over here in parts and pieces and I don't have an inventory system
Like if I knew what I had the stock I could sell it eBay and all kinds of shit, but I can't do anything with it
Okay, so I'm just gonna go start going over to the basic questions that thing that he was dealing with was gonna have all my inventory
It was gonna be a portal where I was gonna be able to add my products put my images and it was gonna populate all of the different
Shopify
Quick books jobber with one click
This is gonna be fucking yep, yep, so
That's what I was doing, but I could work with the guy bro. I couldn't manage it. So I
I got that he's I got a whole folder full of this shit. I don't know where it's at. Nikki has it. I'm gonna ask her for it
Who make use your wife? Yeah, okay. What's that guy's name?
John oh, it's always John
No, what's that guy's in the work for me
The guy that was a web dude that didn't do anything
Malik
Hey, do you have that packet of information Malik gave me after I let him go
At the house somewhere a question mark
Um, I was about to find it, but I wanted me to have all the information. He
He was like adamant about as I do. I don't give a shit about your information like it
You know all it's gonna happen is I'm gonna go to someone else
They're gonna tell me all this is bullshit and that they got a whole other way to do it
Yeah, so I'm sorry you had to go through that experience and and it makes my job more difficult, right?
But honestly it makes me better and this is why we're doing this, right?
You're helping me get better
Ultimately, I'm here to make you more money, right? That's my plan
When I make you more money I get paid right and that's how I'm going about it
Bro, I am seeing the dollar signs and I have to refrain from making any suggestions right away
Because ultimately it's not me who's gonna
Modify your operational plan. It's the team, right? So I have
Macau he is a systems like engineer, right? He develops systems, right?
He works for the Air Force. He's done contracts with the Pentagon. I have Trent
He is a robotics engineer like he can
Build it's called IoT Internet of Things so that recording system the camera system that we talked about like anything you
Mind can fathom like he does industrial
Um communication industrial programming industrial like shit. I'd be really curious to see
What kind of system he can put together for you just in the
Hardware itself like the printers
The scanners like all of your gadgets
I would assume are just connected to your network
And the only way you can communicate to your hardware is via
Protocol through your windows database like
Like you to pull up your printer specs. You have to go to the queue or the app and you side your deal, right?
Oh, no, he just got to the printers. Yeah, like yeah, but I'm trying to make that I like would you
Would you like to see all your printers on one dashboard and be like like
This and again, I'm just I don't know what these guys are capable of but and then I got Matthew
This guy used to work for Amazon. He helped build Amazon's environment to my what I believe. I'll show I'll show you their websites
They have their own
I'm just the guy to help the acquisitions
Now I you know how I've been since for three years. We know each other
I have been chasing this dream ultimately to kind of just
help
Make connections and it's been working and now I developed my first software
Intellectually did it know how to really develop it
That's when I paid for this program. That's where I met these cats. So we're all
paid a lot of money just to get into this room
To ultimately help us figure out our own goals
I just so happened in my first week met these guys and I was like
I was like meant to be dude straight up like I honestly truly feel that I have gods hand and
People's hand on my shoulders and I'm guiding me
Along this path and I'm hearing your problems and I'm seeing the opportunity
So what we are working out right now why I have all these cameras and you know
The big this is like literally the beginning to our agency. You are going to be our first client
that we are going to
Use this as our rollout method our onboarding process, right? So I appreciate that and I don't take that lightly
So I took the time last night. We have these processes, right?
So we have this five question for us to pretty much hone in on your
constraints, right? And then the other pages I put together. I did some market research
for you
About the opportunities that you shared with me about your
Wanting to expand a little bit, but you can't expand if you don't have the processes and procedures in place
To support the expansion, right? That you're creating a
Fucking heading. So what my thought in my plan is let's let's get this thing
Let's get this shop tuned in dialed in, right? So it makes a list of life a whole lot easier
Where now she can be working on the business not in the business, right? Yeah, and then
Same thing with you like I and and ultimately if we can
Illustrate to you Kelsey that we saved you or made you a significant amount money more every month by integrating our systems
It gives you the ability to level up
It gives you the information like I can afford another $40 an hour employee if he's gonna do this this and this and this
And my margins stay the same of what I was used to before
But you can't make those calculations because you don't ultimately know the bottom and your operational cost your daily operational
But it's but it's not really accurate because you don't know how much an assets and inventory you have
Yeah, and then not so that's let's focus on that side now
Now you're getting your books reconciled and your cash flow statements going now
Let's see how much money you really have sitting in just inventory
Your machines do we know how much each one of these cost like all these
Do you have it like you that's what I'm trying to get you at let's let's start
I think let's start there. So I'm gonna go through these questions
So the first one is the biggest problem
Kelsey for plotter mechanics. What is the single biggest operational or financial friction in the business right now?
The problem that keeps you working late
I do everything
I mean I do everything I come in here
I
Load all this crap into my car. I drive it all over town
I fix everybody's printers while my phone is blowing up all day long trying to communicate with Alyssa
Between stops and then by traffic for an hour like last night, you know one hour for me at home
Like I'm trying to change Joe so I can at least split the tasks
You know, so I've been spending time with him working harder
I'm so exhausted of
Uh, pouring myself into people like I'm like that's the last thing I'm pouring myself
So I'm gonna I'm gonna try and teach him some things so he could you could do half of the jobs at least right up
Half of my task would be it would be it for me tomorrow
Good job. Mm-hmm. I just have been trying to train and to teach him a little bit more
So I was talking to Joe about that a little bit because you don't have any SOPs. You don't have any
Systems in place to make
One task redundant right for instance loading paper whatever jobs that need to be done here first
Before moving out into the field like you don't have those types of systems in place, right
From what I gather from talking to Joe like there's no standard operation
You know she's she's contacting me and saying hey, let's go over your schedule for tomorrow
You know like you got this job that job this part that part and it's all on your shelf over there
I have a shelf that floats over there that she gets it all stacked up
Cool cool
No
So
So I depends on how that's what I was telling Joe like
how cool would it be to have
Plotter Mechanics his own like app and let's say like when you are ready to start onboarding people
The hardest part about onboarding somebody is the training
How do you get them up to speed? It takes you another week two weeks of training, right?
What if I would have we spent time and energy and developing a system to train people to follow a step by step
Guide to do mundane tasks that need to be done around the shop
Right, but the problem is that you have to spend another dollar
Meaning hiring and I have another employee to hold that employees hand, right?
Well, instead of putting that dollar on an employee that has to keep
Habitually doing it every single time somebody comes through the doors as a hire
Well, let's just give them a login and now they have this app that walk them through the
base
Responsibility of your position. Oh, and
You need to know how to load paper or printer here. Here's here's the printer on your app
Here's all the things you need to know about this printer. It's all right here manuals
Extructions videos how to load the paper what you know what I mean like break it down to that kind of level to help
retain
Quality I think that has been one of your point pain points that you mentioned in the past is that you can't find quality help
right and
This gives you the ability to at least start finding that quality
I
You can't hire somebody not give them what you said, right, you know
And that you know that's fine. That's works that that's how we operate but the problem is Kelsey is that when you leave it up to
Interpretation it costs you money
Oh, yeah, lots of it
And we are trying so you have all these sives and we're just trying to fuck make that funnel fucking weak proof, you know
so
I got a really good idea of your base problem now the cost of that problem based on your experience
how much is this
Problem whether it's through lost revenue
Unexpected maintenance the labor cost the cost of business per month
What would be your estimated value on that problem

---

## chris_DJI_01_20251202_215022

Just think about all the problems that you're having.
How much do you think you're losing every month off of those problems in your head?
Oh, I don't really know.
I probably lost like 10,000 dollars last year.
It total. 10,000 last year total.
That's pretty good.
Okay, okay, perfect.
Okay, let's just keep it.
Let's break it down to the month of what we've talked about your base problem.
The problem is the biggest problem is that I'm the only one that knows anything about a printer here.
So if anybody calls my company out of all the fingers I have out there right now,
a list of the handle supplies orders, you know, and basic things.
But at the end of the day, like I have to talk to the person.
I have to sell the person I have to do everything.
So you're saying like so much.
If I don't come to work, we're not making any money.
So I see.
So the business just creeps to a halt and within a couple of months, we'd be out of business.
So you're saying the tea like.
I mean, the majority of our calls are service calls.
And you're the only one here who can do service.
I continue to print head on.
Yeah.
I could do some like maintenance.
She's knowledgeable, but she's not the person that.
You know, a lot of a lot of like what you do here is selling people.
So out of the technical work that service calls that you get.
How much of that is like if you rank the technicality of that service call out of that range.
And what is there a way to determine the if the problem is at your caliber or Joe's caliber.
Yeah.
Or Alyssa's caliber.
Like is there a way to gauge that?
Yeah.
To some degree.
I mean,
I get involved in.
I don't even know what I'm doing.
Oh, shit.
I've never even seen the printer.
Dude.
Nobody even know what it is.
Never seen it.
Never heard of it.
Interesting.
Scared the shit out of me, dude.
I saw this big guy and dusty ass thing.
I was like, it looks like a piece of garbage.
Like the heads are $3,000 a piece and there's 12 of them.
Jesus.
Okay.
Gotcha.
And this lady wants me to save the day.
It's like there's no miracle.
Okay.
Cool.
Cool.
But I can't send Joe over there.
Right.
Like I couldn't even make something out of it.
You know what I mean?
So.
Right.
I don't know what I'm getting into.
And then things happen, dude.
Cool.
I appreciate that.
And that's another thing, too.
Like a lot of my opportunities that I gain come from being out there.
Oh, I see what you're saying.
Like if I'm driving to this place and then right next door is another dude.
I'm over there giving business cards, you know.
So like I was just this week.
I was.
Do you enjoy that?
Totally.
Yeah.
Is that where you find your enjoyment when you're working your business?
I like going to places, talking to the owners of the company.
And what the pain points are.
Loot in my business card.
And then later on I get a call.
You're having this week.
So I dropped a card off this lady.
And then I got a call.
Agnew training.
And I was like, Agnew training.
I go back to my notes.
I look.
I think I look at the address.
Like, no shit.
Man, I dropped a business card over there like three weeks ago.
Three months ago.
And now they're calling.
You mentioned your notes.
What do you mean?
Where are you?
Where is your notes?
Like what notes are you storing?
Where do you keep messages?
History.
Like I went back.
Like when I get a contact, I send it to Alyssa.
I say, hey, take a picture.
I send it to her.
I say, can you add that to the database?
Send them an e-mail.
Give them my contact.
And how does that process look, Alyssa?
Does that work out pretty well when he does that?
When he sends you a business card to fill out, I guess, a news.
Like when I did it.
It works pretty well.
I put them into the system.
I send them an e-mail.
Hey, there's four mechanics.
And then this is all through job.
What am I assuming as your CEO?
I wouldn't say we're there yet.
But I try and I'm extremely adamant about her when she's on the phone.
She can't get through several numbers, but I can't.
I'm like, hey, I need your cell phone number.
And I'm going to send you a text message right now,
because I don't want to be sitting in this dude's driveway where I can't get through
and no one's answering the phone.
I'm not going to solicit your shit.
I'm not going to send you marketing and all that.
But when I send that message, I'll be there in 45 minutes.
You better be there.
Right.
Yeah.
So I want all of the communication to be through job.
But then what happens is like people open the messages and don't do anything about it.
And then don't.
Then it's fucked.
You know what I mean?
People will read the message, but don't handle it and don't market as unread.
And then nobody sees the message.
Where did you find it helpful?
I skimmed the job or text messages every morning.
I sit in the hot terminal.
I go through job or message communication.
I go through my text messages back to like a couple days,
because there's things in there.
You know what?
That aren't finished yet.
I have like a bunch of...
I don't even look at my inbox anymore, bro.
Do you email?
No.
I can't look at it too much.
She's dealing with most of it.
I skim it just to make sure I'm not missing an opportunity,
but the rest of it like claiming it, getting rid of the junk mail is like...
So listen, when you're going through his emails,
how does he get a report of his emails?
Like, she calls you, says she lets you know.
Basically, if there's something that needs to be handled,
I just tell her to call me.
Because otherwise, I'm not looking at my email for hours on end.
Right, right.
Got it.
Text messages, even.
And who do you use for email?
So is all your environments through Microsoft 365?
Mm-hmm.
So you have a Microsoft 365 account?
Yes.
Cool.
Next question.
Timeline and future.
How long have you been dealing with this particular problem?
And if you don't take action in the next six to 12 months,
what does the future of your business look like?
I've been dealing with this problem since the beginning of time,
since I first ever had a business.
Which was when?
Oh, it's part of the previous one.
Wow.
But just, you know, I thought with this drive to technology
and everything, things would get more easier to do.
But the every piece of technology I add in my business makes it more complicated
and more messed up, dude.
And elaborate on that.
How?
It's just there's too many pieces.
Like, there's a website.
There's the database.
There's the CRM.
There's the interface with the, you know, Java now.
We've got like all these different things.
They don't have the same information.
So like, I've got capsule, QuickBooks, Java, Shopify.
All have different information.
Some's got some shade over there.
Some's got it over there.
Yeah.
I got Outlook.
I got text messages.
I got a text message on my cell.
My business number has a text number.
Java has a text number.
I have a text number.
Right.
Nobody calls the office hardly ever.
They call my cell phone.
Even though they're out of the numbers, they call myself
because they know that they're going to get the results.
So do you have a private number to separate your personal life
from your business life?
Does that drive you crazy?
No, because people don't really bother me when it begins.
Okay.
You know, like, it's just during business hours when there's money to be made.
I'm going to be available and take the call to the office.
100 percent.
Nothing I hate worse than calling a place and get the fucking voice mail.
Yeah.
I don't, I go to the next place, bro.
And that's where I get a lot of my business.
Yeah.
Actually, honestly, the reason I get a lot of my business is because people will call in.
I got her train now to where she knows I'm out there.
She knows where I'm at.
She's got the map in front of her.
And she's like, hey, Kelsey, there's a call that came up in 10b.
I'm going to throw it on your schedule real quick.
If you can make it by the day.
It's a quick, quick $500 grab.
Bingo.
Right.
I've already got like my schedule.
I already know what it needs.
What?
Who I push back.
Right.
Oh no, shit.
So if you're over there and you can spend an extra 30 minutes to make a grand.
And you can push it back.
So is that and that's where job.
See, that stuff doesn't happen unless you got a brain behind it.
Right.
You got to have somebody with common sense.
That's like, okay.
Oh.
10b today.
This call just came in there and 10b.
Maybe I should call Kelsey and tell him.
Like before, Alyssa came along and we had job her and all this shit going on.
This guy over here and writing on a note.
I'd be out in Mesa.
I'd come back tomorrow.
You see a note from the day he did.
Oh, yeah.
Jim Bob called for Mesa.
Five minutes from there.
Yes, that you dickhead.
Like now I'm going to be driving for another two hours.
You don't have a shit about me.
You show up late to work every day.
And then I got a drive for four hours because of it.
So do you see Kelsey's location on the jobber's map?
Does it provide you a ping of his?
He has my cell phone right there.
She could look at my location.
Oh, so you share your location with her cell phone with her?
I don't, but she could.
I don't.
She doesn't need to know where I'm at.
She knows about where I'm at by.
Oh, what are you going?
I see.
Like, jobber looks different on us.
Her screen.
Like, I can't even use the computer version of it.
Hardly.
Why is the user interface just completely different?
It does more things.
It's more.
It's.
Yeah, it's just the cell phone.
Okay.
It's good to know.
Good to know.
Good to know.
Do you like jobber?
I mean, look what she's looking at.
It's pretty good.
There's something that you.
I mean, I can't look at all those.
Yeah.
Oh, yeah.
So I've got everything on my calendar.
So I can keep track of everything and everyone.
So do you.
Is it.
If there were.
You filter it and turn off certain things if it's overwhelming.
I'm going to ask you this question.
I want to ask you too, but I'm going to ask Liska.
If there was a magic wand solution, if I gave you a magic wand.
And you can build a perfect no compromise solution to fix any problem.
What specific tool or system would that look like for plot or mechanics?
Well, if we could get the inventory and wrap that would be fantastic.
That's your magic wand.
Say so because then he's going to call me and say,
I need you to prepare this and this and this and this.
Do we have this?
And then I can just look over.
Oh, okay.
Now she's like, oh, you have this.
She's running like back and forth.
Okay.
And what's your magic wand?
If you had a magic wand, what problem would you wave or solve with one wave?
A reliable field tech.
Hmm.
I can go on and leave you a 50% of my deal.
I will be number two for sure.
Responsibilities.
Because I'm not.
Why?
I can't do it.
I can't do anything new.
I don't want to do anything like I'm trying not to do this.
You know what I mean?
Because I'm trying to like, well, yeah, you have freedom, bro.
I think you start a business to get freedom.
But you don't have freedom because this is called.
I never really have had freedom, but I'm actually at a place now in my business.
Because I started with basically nothing.
Right.
And so now I'm at a point where I have steady cash below.
And like, I'm not at least my, my worries and like, how am I going to pay for the bills or whatever.
Right.
I'm not looking, I have all the things and tools I need to keep sustained operation.
I have inventory.
I have parts, you know, like I, I don't want to inventory all these parts, but I have parts for jobs that I need.
I can't wait to show you my solution for that, by the way, but yeah.
Magic wand.
Yeah.
Think about that.
What do you think about that?
Can I go use a restroom?
I would say like.
Okay.
Yeah.
Think about that real quick.
Okay.
You have to, you've got to do the job.
It's got to be reasonable for the customer to want to pay it, too.
You know what I mean?
Like, if I go out and do a job and it takes me three hours, or I send something that's unknowledgeable, doesn't know what they're doing.
It takes them two days.
He's like a mechanic and that's why I'm.
So I'm going to pay for all the mistakes that that guy needs because he doesn't have 25 years of experience.
Yeah.
So, and you're so funny because we were talking about that with our years of experience at my house.
Tricks at my sleep, bro.
So that came up with our development team yesterday.
How do we charge people?
And so what we're doing, what I haven't talked to them in now since, hey guys, we're going to talk to you on this subject is that my thought is.
Same thing for a mechanic, right?
A mechanic has to change an alternator.
If we, let's say our alternator is a simple implementation of an API or build something for a customer, right?
I know our guys could associate that one task to an hourly rate, just like a mechanic.
There's a standard hourly rate to change an alternator.
There's a standard hourly rate to change.
That will bearing a break.
You know what I'm saying?
There's, I think it's the automotive industry standard of billable hours.
Now, if that mechanic is so good because he spent 15 years changing breaks and he can change a break in 30 minutes,
but they're able to bill 2.5 hours, that's the profit, right?
Same shit with you.
I feel like we should, and this is what I want to talk to my team about, is we develop our for a lack of better term hourly rate for specific jobs, aka building something out for you.
Oh, because it sounds like we have a change of a print head paper.
Okay, paper is to say 25.25 of an hour.
A print head is usually at 1.75, right?
So you give a denominating value for every task that will ultimately say, okay, this is actually five billable hours.
If I get it done in three, I'm making money.
The customer doesn't need to know that, but at least we are creating that margin.
So we know, fuck, I spent five and a half hours, I actually, I didn't lose money, but I could have made more money for the next time.
And maybe have a system where you can say, hey, next time, let's do this instead of that, we would have saved an hour.
You know what I'm saying?
Like be able to make your, your systems, your, because if we, from what I'm hearing, if they're, we can figure out a way to replicate you.
And if all that takes is by wearing a camera while you service these printers.
And then now you have a digital recording of how the shit works and you're talking to yourself as that.
When I am working, yeah, dude, and they're so small and you wouldn't even like, you would like that is bigger, bigger than that.
And now you have a digital reference that your next service guy, your next service call can follow.
Hey, and let's, well, I would like to take all those videos and put them online.
You see what's happening right now?
And, and, you know, I got Joe, I hired Joe, and I said, Joe, you gotta go through and post all these ads online for me.
Post all these printers that we have for sale, we post them high, you get to our name out there.
But now I'm getting calls from like all these states, you know, remote support.
Like I'm doing like telephone calls and charging people like, I understand five bucks to talk to them on the phone.
And they're happy to pay because.
Dude, so wait, wait, wait, wait, hold on, let's elaborate on that for one second.
Dude, did I just hear you say you get paid for consulting somebody over the phone and you don't have to leave your office?
Yeah, I could be doing that all day long.
But I focused on that from, to be honest with you, dude, like I'm tired of this driving around the city.
Yeah.
And all this, whatever.
Yeah.
If I could figure out how to optimize the web.
Right.
Keep my service business running down here.
Right.
Move to Piantop.
Sit upon a porch and mic.
Oh, I'm going to fucking get you there, bro.
And sit there with my earbuds on and just be like, hey, what's up?
You know, FaceTiming.
Let's go, you know, like, can I have a spot up there with you?
And then we can have one of those mornings together?
Yeah.
Awesome.
I can't wait.
I can't wait.
But that's what I, I mean, like as I'm doing more of it, you know, it's like remote service.
Like I could be somewhere else where I am not fighting traffic back and forth.
And there's so many people out there that are doing with themselves.
I want to do it themselves, but they need some help, you know, and like.
So what, like, how, what the, I like it.
I enjoy training.
So what if, what if we created like another version of the polymath guild, right?
Where you have become the mecca of knowledge or you have built your name about just fixing printers.
And there's a particular job that you necessarily don't want, but you know another service tech.
Like, hey, dude, I have this item.
I have this repair.
I really don't have time for it.
Would you be interested in taking that work on?
I do it all the time.
And then I have other guys that work for me.
So, so it is not morally unacceptable to ask for a fee if you keep repeatedly sending that guy work.
Right?
It is not morally wrong for you to do that.
You have put time and money.
What I do is I, you know, like, I know what it's like.
Like, when your cop, your machine broke and you need that thing to work.
And you can't get there until Tuesday, but you got a guy that could be there on Monday.
Yeah.
Right.
People call me with that.
I'm not looking for the work, but they'll call me and be like, hey, if I'm out and I'm like, hey, if you have problem, that cop, you're calling me in there.
That's, that's the customer service aspect.
You know, like, we basically charge the same rate.
So we charge 250 for a service call.
And that guy charged me 150.
I make 100 bucks.
He makes his rate.
Bro.
You don't fucking do nothing.
That's the best part.
But the problem is, Kelsey, we have to start with, we have to get this place just humming.
Yeah.
There's so much disconnect in here.
It's the whole process of even taking care of it.
You can't you can't do nothing, bro.
If the foundation is broke and the API thing, now what's the name of the list?
I had my hopes up really high about it because it's all the shit he told me, sound great.
But just the constant not seeing anything ever happened.
So what?
So, and I wanted to touch on this guys, like, let's hear this really loud and clear.
But then we talked to Malik.
We got a workshop.
Let's make this very importantly aware that the reason why Kelsey did not like his
deliverable is because the
frequency of conversation to you of the status of the project because there was no status
update that you can physically see. I mean I got a bunch of status updates every week but there's
nothing I've never physically came to like some bullshit like template that didn't work
and the idea behind it was good and I you know I was throwing my ideas like I like it like this
yeah that's cool oh oh you know the website all wrong oh we got to read oh you know so now he's
like fumbling around with the website read and he changed a whole bunch of stuff in the website
because of what I told you about the groups or how would I choose in there so he didn't realize
how big a thing problem it was so I was like look just make it work with like four products
that I sell right I was looking at your website last night actually I actually threw it through
our little skimmer that we have like so this so this is the same problem you're looking for
you sick yeah but we're going to have the same problem with SNS wool sheds like we're going to
develop their same dude literally legitimately the same situation although they don't sell
prints but the foundation of the overall company the the wool sheds the ones that we printed
those banners for and all that yeah my mom and my dad's yeah same situation so I am literally
starting at the ground the foundation right and working my way up and and that's that's that's
my method of approach and it's literally the same thing here man we're going to do small little
incremental gains I like jobber but everything out like I have a whole another CRM that has shit
loads of emails contact information you guys don't use it well we transitioned to jobber and it's
still I still use it because I have all my password so we just need to extract everything from it
I do you pay for it monthly yeah but not much okay that's a 30 bucks hey man that shit adds up
though bro powerful program no I agree I don't want I don't want to pay for it if I don't have to
it's a pretty powerful program but I just don't it's too powerful you know what I mean like it's
got oh and what's this called a capsule oh that you mentioned that okay and they have a whole like
CRM integration I'm not marketing integration where you can do like so what did you like about it
that jobber did it offer vice versa well when I started the company over the first time I did it
I used I don't even know what I did man I used quickbooks professional eventually but an
outlet and just word them out okay okay I built I built that thing up what was the question
do you ask me just like what was the difference that you like capsule versus oh when I started
over I was like I had kind of like not worked for a year so like I was and I had relaxed and since
it was my company I never I didn't really present myself as the owner all the time because that's
sucks you know I just be like a worker right right right right well next what I thought it
and I was just the worker so I just acted like a worker right right you know I just kind of
so when I started over and I started like cold calling and stuff I was like
calling the same people over in the same day like oh shit like I'm like going to keep track of this
you know so I did a little bit of research and I was like well quickbooks sucks and I did some
CRM research and the first one that somebody would actually contact me and help me with was
capsule gotcha so they got me on the phone they gave me a little rundown they helped me get my
information show me how to import my that's this that's the second time I heard in two days one guy
pays 40 G's a year for his software for his CRM but he does like heavy steel fabrication I talked
to him last night a little bit he paid 40 grand a year because the agent gave him his login
walked him through the process pretty much hold it his hand for the first two months and then he
got a $40,000 a year contract out of it because of it I was like god damn and what you're telling me
is you signed up over because of that fact too then I tried to use it but I couldn't get the people
I worked with to implement and use it with me so I'm just using it a lot you're talking about
your co-workers or your employees he's not here anymore okay so use that my sister log on
evolve she got it all set up for me but it's just overcomplicated it did it was lacking a whole
bunch of features that job are having she was already using jobber for husband's carburet clean
oh the jobber doesn't do a good job with jobber does no integration with the website
right build like a service-based website that's just like I want my carburet clean but you want
to have products and shit as they don't deal with that so but it handled the texting for one
location right the woman we went all over it right right taking the notes you know like I'd put
I'd have to log into QuickBooks put my notes in and then I have to go into capsule and do some
other shit and there's just too much stuff on the phone for me I'm like I don't want to do this
man like I'm tired of my phone yeah so jobber brings it all into one location but I still but I
still because of the data being skewed all over we haven't brought all of our garbage into jobber
so all of our database still has all the shit in it and jobber just has looks in QuickBooks damn dude
so much opportunity I'm so excited my whole database of my old clients you know it's old now
but I still have all the emails and phone numbers and all that I could be marketing and doing
them hey I'm over here hey I've got compatible links hey check this out make videos dude like you
should you should put these in here because I'm gonna come over there and help you here's my
self here's my number here's my so your tell out what I'm also hearing here is that you're
gonna need some sort of media agency as well to kind of manage your videos but then also that
can turn your daily output which would be rewearing the camera showing your daily routine
that is opportunity for marketing well that can all turn into something that's going to be
web-based sales right we got to get the end no this I'm just I'm just thinking out loud but you're
right it's like my aims for instance I could drop shit my aims directly from the manufacturer
they already have my labels I should oh no shit so they could drop shit before me I could
automate it to where an order comes in it gets paid PO gets sent over drop ship information
so so we don't even have to touch it that's what I want to do so it's fun you bring that up and
let me ask this question before I do okay so we uh I don't think we elaborated on your idea of
the magic wand can we go over that real quick oh the magic wand would just be basically a way
to get communication to happen properly sweet like everything all your systems all your pieces
all of my pieces to communicate with each other so that we can communicate with each other better
be efficient be it more of a better team operation right right right perfect like I just want one
hub where I go and that's what that thing that guy was building for me was supposed to be got it
and but I was like well this thing doesn't do all the things job or does so yeah let me let me
use the job for my service stuff yeah like well she has to add a product she's got to add it
into QuickBooks job right all right listen I've already thought of this I think when we first
talked when we printed out those trifles like seven weeks ago I just didn't know how to do it yeah
I still don't know how to do it but I got guys who do and I can't wait for them to see this dude
they're gonna look you've just talked to Malik about what he did yeah because he has all the
database I'm gonna get I'm gonna I'll I'll initiate the conversation with Malik yeah and then
what I'm gonna do is have Malik talk to the guys yeah the developers the guys who actually know
what the fuck he's talking about because I ultimately I spent a lot of money and if there's
no way to recover any of that work that you do oh no no a hundred percent we're not gonna let
that go to waste for nothing man we're here to work for you well he he did a bunch of work in
Shopify and he was he was trucking along but I just couldn't keep anime right for nothing right so
quick question now the last one the core of the why you choose to build this business in a tough
high stakes logistical market what's the story behind plotter mechanics and what drove you to make
the direct access rental or like selling the e-commerce like the prints and all that stuff
like what drove you to do that just start a business well why did you start the business like
ultimately we knew that you started working and servicing printers and then that just got expanded
on right well no what happened is I worked at a company for the first 10 to 12 years of my corporate
life and I hated it I hated working in the opposite environment I hated all the office drama
of bickering that went on there I mean the way that people acted when the box was there and wasn't
there and I just didn't fit into that environment I I like to go out and work I always gotten paid
but I think that I was really getting out of it was a sense of accomplishment you know what I mean
so like yeah like my wife might not like me but my customer was happy that I fixed their printer
as a kid growing up you know like I barely graduated high school so you know my family's like
they call it I became an accidental entrepreneur
tell the person how to do it and honestly if I had to start over again right now after doing it
two or three times I still don't know what to do I feel like bro I'm like yeah I got fired
all I knew how to do was fix printers and help people and I've been doing that for the last 20
years but every time I start doing that the generate revenue and then I need people then it falls
apart and I'm managing I don't manage the people properly because I'm too busy
yeah you're working in the business not on the business yeah and I want to start doing that
because I actually do like training people like I like going places where people don't know how to do
something and teaching them a better way to do it or see a way that they're doing it like I have
a clock lady right now I mean she's got a legit clock business bro they sell custom clocks from
seven inches 12 inches 15 like a pizza do all the 36 custom printed on wood and these printers are
expensive a hundred thousand dollars well they're they're they're dilapidated one isn't complete
this with disarray and it needs like probably twenty thousand dollars or the work to get it to run
again or she could buy that printer over there for ten grand get some nice material and change
your process oh it's talking to me I'm actually going to call her because she can't stop
printing what she's been doing because it looks a certain way do you want to call her right now
and just see how that goes or do you want to wait to do that separately well no I'll talk to her
later but see she sent me these pictures this is her new process so she went and had some shit
printed at Montroy and then she buys these rings for the wood and she pops these rings onto the
wood around the edges of it to make the finish the edge off because right now she prints right
on the wood they take a round piece

## kelce_DJI_01_20251202_201721

just to set it up okay this is my Kelsey's mic so you have what's that no DJ so
you can you have a clip that you can clip this on or you can put the magnet
through your shirt yeah so I find the magnet a little easier
so that's already recording so the reason why I ask you about the time yeah it's
like do you tell me you know I have some questions that I can ultimately
they start so these are pretty much this kind of the script of what I'm gonna
stick to the whole point of why we're doing this is a for me to learn how to
interview a business owner in a way like I'm all I'm trying to do is understand
the story of your business the story of the problems you occur every day
ultimately if we pursue that type of I don't want to say interview but that
process of just telling the story right that's kind of my approach to
ultimately provide you the resources in far as the integrations the
communications all that kind of stuff oh it's already there okay so where's that
job at oh Scott still I think I'll show you right now I'll show you what I do
I'll show you how I basically what I'm doing so mirroring to the screen okay is
the proof for my little white side I love that and then there's the back he sent
me a proof earlier where the fist was right in the center and it was right
across the whole car and I kind of liked that better but I also I told him to
put all that latex DTF shit on the on the roof rack thing because people are
gonna stare at that thing on my roof while I'm in traffic and shit you know what I mean
so let go around it would like bullet points at an angle or something I don't
really know I don't know there was a way to put that right there oh it's easy you
can put it however you think I can be mad up on the top of the roof I think that
might be pretty good you could have it in there twice but originally had it
across the back of the whole trunk oh yeah it was like right here like towards
a license plate right yeah right like the wrist was like at the bottom of the
trunk and it was like a whole boom across there but I was like and I I want
them to give me I want him to move that shit up to the car carrier because that's
where people are gonna be staring at when I'm in traffic when they're looking at
my car and they'll be able to read it just like the key words like I put like I
don't I don't really know how to do it but I put latex DTF DTG solvent UV
curable aquis resin like all the key words that people would know in the
industry you know I mean if you don't know what that means that that means you
don't know what I do and it doesn't really matter right and then I got my
little barcode there so they could take a picture of people that you know are
savvy to that stuff hyperlinks are the way to go yeah yeah I created a new logo
I want you to see it here's the hood
oh yeah that's fire so yeah I want to put some more I'm no it's a sign on
I'm gonna I'm gonna probably a second surface wrap the car carrier you know
what I mean to put the decals up there like the information or something and I
might do the logos of the companies in color on there like where it says
cannon momma you know that probably but I can put those on after I do the
wraps I can put them over I want for HP HP would be blue right so use like
the logos yeah Muto's blue graph text blue cannons red momma is like purple yeah
so I might put that on the on the roof rack up top or I like I kind of like
the way it looks across the bottom of lower across like the the kick panel across
the bottom yeah yeah yeah that's what I like and then I can put like a white
stroke around the outside of it so it kind of pops out of there yep so how is
your Adobe so cycle going what does that mean like because before you had Lee
in taking all of the artwork that I submitted to Adobe is are you guys able to
start or like still do like so let's say if you have a random person who created
their artwork in Adobe can you help them modify the document to get to print
yeah do Joe's pretty good at this that's what I was trying to say is Joe like
we saw this guy a printer he had a cutter and I was like oh that thing's a
piece of shit Joe's like that's the same one I got in my house I was like oh yeah
I forgot dude because they have a bunch of cheap as Chinese tools that there's
house he's got a he's got a Chinese bender for making like channel letters and
shit and he knows how to run all that stuff he saw he saw this machine that
was like 10 12 feet long yesterday and he was like oh I could run that I was
like damn dude I don't even know what that is yeah and then like we went to this
guy's office yesterday and I was like the guy called me out there because he
wanted to trade me for my printer for his bus to ask one and I'm like and then
give me some broken laminar so I get I you know I get in the courtesy of stopping
by well on the way there he's like oh dude maybe you know with my printer you
know like I'm having all these problems I got this wrap I got to try to wrap
these cars I got to fix a panel and I can't get it to match and so I'm like okay
well this is kind of turned into a service called this point you know I mean
if I go over there and I look at the situation I'm like look bro I go this
original shit you printed is wrong like you were missing a color a print he's
like yeah but it looks cool dude I go I don't give a shit but to recreate
something that looks cool when your printer was running off of you know a
missing channel of a print head your you let your lack in 50% of your black I'm
like look at your black text it's like blue so yeah but you liked it and I was
like well recreate that shit good luck dude not even a perfect not even an
expert could do that dude but I zoomed in on it and showed it to him like like
you showed him the pixel counts well just take it like look at this man I
I believe I thought I saved it yeah right here
these are the two colors and I'm like this this is not from a distance but up
close so like if you look how much bleed there is right it's everything looks
like shit but just look at look at this is that this is what it looks like so
you got like some cyan magenta yellow some greens you know but you don't see
a lot of black I mean there's a there's a there's blacks in their black so
that's how you're determining that's what he that's what he liked oh but this is
what he was getting and what is that again this is just zoomed in this is
what everything looks like when you zoom in oh so this is the actual dot dude
you use your use your camera to kind of well I'm just looking at it just just
saying look at the way this looks like see how dark that is then how it like
more more there's no white in the background you see how it's just all color if
you look at this one over here there's lots of vacant space in the back you
know what I mean like white areas right where the other one just flooded with
ink so like I'm at how he created that color who knows man like you just
got to start guessing and making samples and he's trying to like match a panel
like they did the panel wrong where that where the text is lines up like this on
the doors so he's got to redo the panel well now he's gonna have to match that
color in the center and it's gonna look like shit dude like you can have to do
the whole back of the van you know to get it to look where this guy that just
spent three or four thousand dollars is gonna shit his pants when he looks at
it so he's got three partially done wraps and the guy stressing out you know
and it's like not my fault but I spent an hour my time there looking at his
broken fucking laminators while he's asking me for advice and I tell him telling
him you know I go look dude he's like I go just work with Michael dude like I
go Michael's better than I am with this anyways he's like yeah but he's busy
dude and I go well you got to wait for his ass dude like you know like I don't
know I don't know what you know what he how often do you come in those scenarios
daily every day's a trial you know like I mean I'm doing an install for a guy
that right now today that you know he's paying me a thousand bucks to do an
install in an episode which is crazy to me but there's like some guy in
Scottsdale wants somebody to hand delivery into his house into this funky
situation and yeah I don't have a problem doing it and now that I got a
person to help me like Joe's Joe so Joe he jumped in on that guy's computer
start tweaking the color bar and within like two tries had it as close as
anything that guy'd gotten an hours you know so we leave and I charge him you
know I go tell this I go to service call I go we got pictures we got proof we
did all this stuff and the guy just hits his pants and I stopped get back to
him because I just now I know what I'm dealing with like somebody who
appreciated what I did and came out there and you know gave him my own I go
look you know here's the deal dude like the first thing is next time before you
print a document do a nozzle check and make sure your machine's up to par so
that you can recreate this shit later on like I mean even if your machine is
running at top notch and you print a wrap today on a HP and you come back two
months later and do it again it's it's not likely going to look identical dude so
is there like depending on the color is it because people just don't know you
think or like why what makes this easy he's just ignorant beyond the fact
that well he he just got lucky he's like he's like who looks it looks good so I
went with it I was like well it doesn't look right I was like look at your
monitor and look at what you look what you gave the guy like these don't look
right but this what your monitor and what you're printing out over here they
look a lot alike you know you're trying to make what's on the monitor look like
not what it's coming out of the printer and that's not I mean I've got all the
tools to figure it out but I don't know how to use them dude like spectrophotometers
and I have a $3,000 spectro that I could go over there it's a it's a media
profiler it's a it's a it's a it's a it's a it's a camera dude it's a color
camera that takes a picture of the color and gives it gives you a value of that
color and where's the output go to that like is it just like a like is it
give you like a grade or yeah you create a profile so like HP's actually have
a built-in spectrophotometer in them oh really yeah so like HP their print head
drifts all over the place so they have they have always had a way to self-calibrate
since the beginning so with your the alignments their self-calibrate morning
who's that oh laminy yeah oh yeah I gotta go show how many uses laminy yeah
let me get print um me I'll stop the recording yeah yeah let me go over there
and help him because you want to take the mic off for a second you can go over
there and make a video about it yeah yeah make a video I'm I sold this guy
this laminar I'm gonna show him my user right now you got you already got
laminar everything who did that for you uh lush dub media yeah check it out dude
I'm gonna he he I'm gonna print it myself since I have all the machines but
he designed it right I'm gonna change up the back I'm gonna lay it down probably
Gus at the end of the sweet down here because lushtub this guy lushtub and Gus
work together like Gus doesn't have a printer yeah so I just fixed his
printer form recently and so I'm like dude let me use you to design my rap
because he's he's talented so I know but I mean I'm just working with the guy
because I'm trying to promote him too you know like I I'm taking his money so
I'm like maybe I should give him my money take take some of mine too oh that's
right you do I need to it but take some more of it actually I do I need to get caught
up but hopefully this let's go do this all right well let's go do this
yeah what kind of event uh the bikers and beards thing beard that'll you know I
think you have my I wonder if Joe ever put that valve on I think he did
huh on yours yeah oh he put I thought I thought he put it on mine he put
the new one yours oh and he put that mine back I know but yours is fixed I'm
saying is mine fixed yet I don't know I ordered the part but I don't know if he put
it on yet
do you know there's somebody else who what did you say there's somebody else oh what's up
dude I'm sorry what's up bro oh shit what's up man you need some ink or what's
going on okay this fight and this one is that good one and I saw you can
see the little right there yeah yeah the bottom yeah you know what we we actually
we actually just had a problem with this shit and and a list has been going back
and forth with the manufacturer yeah but let me call it really quick and ask
her which because we got new ones I think they figured it out let me let me see
what is that a 712 hang on a second let me call it real quick
yeah man it's good sometimes yeah I know I get some help I'm getting some help I got a
guy that I'm training that's pretty good hey listen hey remember all those
problems we've been having with the 712 being cartridges I got pro block over here
and he's got five of them that don't work and one that does work and he just pointed
out to me that the chip on the one that works and the one that doesn't work looks
different and do we have any that work you got that figured out with those guys
yeah all right let me yeah yeah that's okay let me check the chips that we have
then hold on a second I mean this one only the one that works has one or two
that's a 712 right cuz it's weird man like I've actually had this happened I've
taken it out of one and put it in another one and it worked hey Alyssa we only have six of
these on the shelf and I can just give them all five of the ones I have and you can
try them if they don't work you can bring them back but I'll just exchange them for
them really quick because these ones are all full where's your I don't think the
gold contact is the reason I mean the way they it's what's the programming on here is
what the difference is because there's only four leads on there and it comes back
into here I can try yeah I mean Alyssa I don't have time to mess with this
because I got like an interview and I got some other and that now the neighbor wants me
to teach me how to use his laminator so I'm just going to give him this shit and give
you the old shit and then you can test later on and figure it out okay thank you all right
just take that man let me know what happens if it doesn't work bring it back and we'll
figure it out I can get the OEM stuff but it's expensive yeah I can get the originals
but maybe yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah let me see if I do if I don't I can grab I can get one
oh sorry hey
I got him a Gentile yellow
shit I don't have no yet one here okay let me know
yeah call me either way and let me know man because I need to know I got a I got a contact
I've been too busy bro to fuck a dig down on it Alyssa has been trying to figure it out but I
know she sent a whole bunch of them back because it was doing the same thing to other people
so so what's that I don't I have the same machine you have next door and I can test yours
in there I just don't have time to do it right now because and it doesn't matter if it works
in mine and it doesn't work in yours I'll tell I'll have her test those in mine I'll let you know
you test those in yours and let me know you're welcome dude sorry about that sorry about the
problem huh I'm gonna say to go help with this laminate really quick yeah then I'll be over
there doing this all right man sorry so what do we laminate in this this right here
yeah okay so like what happened are you okay yeah I cut it yesterday and it wouldn't stop
bleeding didn't need stitches or anything it just wouldn't stop bleeding because of all the
blood centers and meds I take oh sure so they put up special medicine on air and put a compression
so laminating this thing like just this leading edge is shitty so like I might I might like
take this right here and like trim a clean edge before I feed it in you know like a straight edge
because when you when you go to start it and you got one corner of it's like longer whatever
than it wants to bunch up and do crazy shit so like I I would cut that straight go well I'm
well I'm working on this work on getting that cut off straight so it's it doesn't have a bow
like that and hopefully as squares you can get it you know what I mean because when you once
you put you're gonna be relying on the squareness of this initial cut to feed it in there
from that end or this end well either end but I would say this end because we have more room to
back up and forgive ourselves where if that end we're going right into the I would I would start
over here yeah for sure and then just clean this edge up and you don't want this up curl going
on you go to feed it in there it's gonna make because the dirtier it is going in the dirt
you're just gonna go through it any one of those uh dust free claws you got you got any of those
the other ones yeah we're at I see it yeah you want that cutter you have it if you want it
which cutter maybe you want to go ahead and have it take it okay it's in my way I thought I
was gonna need it I'll try it out man for sure I'll take it over there if nothing else Joe might
be able to use it but it could be something I could be hopefully shit this thing's fucking heavy dude
yeah it looks pretty good all right man so do you know how to do you feel comfortable
starting from scratch you want to start from scratch yeah all right give me a blade
don't cut the wheels somebody cut my wheels up already dude I know I can't believe
that dude this is the one that was cut I know it no mine's cut now too oh is it yeah dude I
didn't know we even used it once and I went to go use it and it was all fucked I'm tired of
man like fuck people they're just terrible man all right so sweet all right so we're gonna back
this up what the fuck is that yeah we're gonna get it as much of the dust out of the way as possible
oh nice you got one oh yeah let's try it out let me see oh god okay
damn sold
no it's a cold it's because it's cold okay
all right so tighten this up on here you got some asking tape yeah we're gonna need that
oh I went to get the rag I never got it or what there it is
if you got to dust this thing off before you use it
uh I don't think that's necessary but it wouldn't hurt it but this will work you want to have
a rag like this with you too because you can if there's any dust on it when it's going in you
can catch it before it goes in there I mean that wouldn't hurt this is the pan the ass
yes she probably she would probably be good I mean you don't want all this you don't
have to do all this every time you go to use it you know what I mean like your environment sucks
so you gotta just do what you gotta do I don't like covers because I don't like putting them on
and taking them off and yeah going back and forth okay so I mean if you ever get confused on
how to weed and look at this instruction right here yeah so it goes under here right you don't
you want to have this lifted up getting it getting it through there can be a pain in the ass but
so yeah the laminate you know obviously faces down so what I like to do I don't have my thing
anymore but I used to have a trimmer where I could I could probably use yours or you pull the
back or back here and then you slice it I know but I had one that was really thin I got another
easier cool perfect we could probably make it work so what I like to do and what I like about this
lamp oh yeah dude that's a terrible that my laminate the first day I had it they rolled over
the wheel and ripped the rip the power cord right out of the back of it dude you got to be
careful with that thing when you're when you're done with this man apparently see that I would
just pick it up and set it up here man because you roll over it back and forth the it'll rip it
out of the back of the machine and everything else oh nice hell yeah that's perfect I need to buy
one of those actually so that's perfect man so look it you want to take the material wrap it over
that roll and get it get it going back this way and pull it back here and then you can just like
when you're loading the media in the printer whatever like you can find it here or not lined up I'm
not that far yet we haven't even taped it on yet but you want to you definitely if you look at
the spindles they've all got numbers on them you know what it means like I've seen it seems to me
like when I'm running 54 I go at like around 70 I don't know if it's 70 there or is it 70 it's
the same on both sides it looks like so if you set these all to 70 then you're going to be at
least in the right ballpark it take up is a little bit skewed right here but that doesn't really
matter what matters is when we tape it on that we get it square yes 70 and this is not 70 anymore
well they're not even if it depends they're not they're not they're not even so you got to choose
aside like if you put it 70 here then 70 is not going to be or you got to figure out where it is
like I don't know that's 69 where you are over there there you go so it's 69 your favorite number
except for I'd rather have 77 well so 69 is where you want to put it okay here here here and also
with your take up reel over here that's that kills the power and that that that makes it on
okay cool so anyways look when you get back here and you see how the materials like I'm squaring
it up right there see when I pull it to the left it goes that way right to the right like there's
a certain spot where it's square you know like it's touching all the way across nice and smooth and
I'm holding it from the center okay and then I hit the lift button back here and drop the pressure
that way now it's not going to be able to move okay and when I pull on it when I'm pulling back
on it if you hold this when it's lifted up that that applies the brake what it it causes this to
lock up to where it can't you're you know you're holding on right there so you want to get it nice
and snug across there but you also have this brake so when you pull see how there's like some
braking going on here yeah go back there and feel it go to the back of the machine where I'm at
and you do it like grab that paper and pull on it with your hands and feel how it feels see that
I think that the brake should be a little stronger like maybe let me see how that feels let me see
no more that's too much like right feel that pull that
you see that now feel this dude like come over here and feel how tight that thing is right now
yeah now twist it right here you feel that pressure you need to have pressure back but not too
much it'll curl the media up like when it comes out if you got too much but you got to have negative
what that does is it keeps it taunt on the roll and it also keeps it going straight you know
what I mean because without that back pressure it'll start to walk around okay so center it up
over there like I showed you pull pressure on it like I said you can back it up you don't want
to waste your material you know what I mean so back it up to where grab it in the middle grab
with one hand in the middle now watch walk it back and forth on the on the thing go left and right
watch how it slides on the roll let leave it lighter like leave it light but you feel it yeah so
find that center point then hit the lift button over there okay it's hard to work with this you
you got to use a lot of tape with this backer I found that that clear tape works pretty good
like packing tape yeah sometimes it holds this backer better because the tape is on a stick to it
there's only there's only two pieces to it but this is the backer right here so this is going
to take the backer up so he doesn't have to deal with it

## kelce_DJI_01_20251202_204811

So that's okay, once we get it going, it'll be all right, but you may have to tape it a couple times.
So now that you have it locked down and tight, then you take your little blade right here.
And if you can separate this, you can give it some slack right here a little bit, just don't slide the roll.
And then if you can get in here,
you can separate that.
And not that talented with the vinyl.
There it is.
And then how is this where you just grab like that?
Maybe.
Oh yeah.
So you take that and then slice that.
This is nice because it won't tear up your roll or you can't slice a hole in it.
I should have had a line before they cut a hole in it.
All right, perfect.
So now we can leave that, but now we're going to need to advance it a little bit.
Pull that underneath.
It should be plugged in the back, but now it's easier.
Somebody cut the wires, I'm going to expose them.
Yeah, stop it.
This seems not working.
Hang on, let me see.
Oh shit, you know what?
What?
It's in, well right now it's in zero.
Oh shit, you know what?
It's in, well right now it's in zero.
Okay, now it's in gear.
Well that sucks.
I think that this thing is fucked up or something, hold on a second.
I'm going to go get the switch off of mine.
It makes it hard to use it if you don't have a foot throttle.
There's only two wires on it, hold on a second.
I'm going to go get the one off of my machine.
I mean you can use it with the button, but it's just not.
You need your hands.
You need your hands for you.
Yeah.
I'm going to steal the foot throttle off this.
Yeah, sure.
Yeah, ask him.
Ask away, I'll be back in a little while.
I'll be back for my interview in a minute, man.
I keep getting it, I keep getting interrupted.
Let's see if this works.
I mean this can't be very complicated.
Yeah, what the hell is something that I don't want that switch bro?
You got to take a look at that.
Take a look at that close here when you're...
Something simple because that doesn't work.
No, it got ran over before in the past and somebody...
They pulled it out of the back of the machine, so it probably happened again.
They probably pulled the wires out of there.
There's only two, three of them.
I need this.
That's what I'm saying.
When you're done with it, if you can, pick it up and set it up here so you're not running it back and forth.
Especially when you don't have any room to work.
So, you know, you're not doing a, you know, typically, do you have an empty core laying around?
No, a 54-inch core, like an empty one.
Where?
No, this?
Yeah, let me have that.
So you understand that the way the release is and all the shit are on this, right?
You got to turn this to where it's facing you.
I'm going to put that one on 1692, right?
Sure.
So, pull this back taunt.
Oh, it's rolling up on itself or something else going on, huh?
You got it a little bit forward.
Oh, yeah.
Okay.
So, you can manually move it here.
And then you can tape this back here.
I don't, I like to just tape it in the center if I can because it feel like it can get, you know,
if you want you tape it on both sides, you're committed.
This has like a sticky side on it.
So, you pull that around like that.
Where's our little slit that I cut in there?
Have you got to it yet?
No.
Okay.
So, now it's connected there.
It's going to, it's going to wrap itself around there.
Okay.
So, we just want to make sure that it, okay, this is coming up here.
Yeah, that's because we haven't taped this to the back or yet.
That's okay.
That just came undone.
That's this.
It just keeps, that's saying that sometimes that clear tape works better, but that's okay.
We're getting ready to tape this, we're getting ready to tape this on there so it doesn't matter.
We're going to tape this good to this.
So, look.
Now that we got this right here,
we have our shits on 69-ish.
It can straighten itself out to some degree.
So, you're just going to lift that off of there.
Let me turn this off.
Let me, let me, let me turn this way, let me tape it this way.
Oh, shit.
Yeah, you guys got, you got to find a good spot for your shit.
Keep it there.
Tell me like a long one, kind of, I'm going to tape right here.
Go all the way across.
Let me start here and get this.
As soon as it, as soon as it comes around once,
like, and then also what you need to have now that you've got this loaded,
is you need to have some, like, waste material.
That's what those are right there.
This is waste?
Yeah.
Cool.
Now that we have this taped on here,
this has got a clutch on it, too.
And this, this tension here is going to change with time, too,
because you've got to kind of dance that thing at the right thing
as the diameter changes.
So,
Nope, came off.
Came on tape.
Yeah.
Okay.
So, look, you can hit the reverse button right here.
Rewind it.
Like, do you tighten this up?
Look, right here.
Tighten that up.
And you're just pulling it backwards.
Okay.
Rewind tape it again.
What's this?
Oh, that...
Hang on.
Let's go like this.
That's the...
Tighten yours up.
Tighten that roll up.
Pull it all the way tight, so that's...
See how...
There you go.
And the hold it snug like that.
I've got...
Let me try to find this clip here.
If I got it, I'll leave it for more.
Okay, go ahead.
Right here, brother.
Is that nice?
Oh.
Just pop that up.
I'm doing that one all the way here.
I think that if it sticks, once it goes around, it's going to be fine.
What the fuck was that?
I've bumped this again.
Oh, okay.
All right, well, nothing should have changed, but since, you know, it's loose, it's already connected to the drive roller down there.
All you want to do is just snug this back up again.
And let it back down.
So, lift.
So, we've got our brake going on there.
We're not going to be putting an original in there.
I mean, we're not going to be putting a roll here, but otherwise you'd have this at $69.2, you know.
And that's a tricky setup right there, because you've got to make sure you have it square.
Right.
And when you get it in there, you've got it going in there, you know what I mean?
See how loose the problem with that right there is trying to do that race car wrap.
You've got to start square, dude, and I mean, you can do it.
You just got to, you have to practice.
It's like riding a bicycle, dude.
Like, it doesn't just happen the first time.
Like, you got to make some mistakes and shit, so it's better to practice with smaller things, but this is all the things I've learned.
So, I feel good about it right now.
Like, I feel like I could go ahead and start that lamination and go, but I'm going to stop.
I'm going to show you the process of putting this piece in there really quick and how to start from there.
So, I'm going to take this off.
I just got some cheap, like, 15-inch bond.
I just cut a piece off and stick, yeah, I just 20-pound bond, 15-inch roll.
I'll stick it in there.
Because once you have this, like, all curled up, it makes it kind of hard to work with, too.
Like, trying to get this to go in there.
But, you know, when you're going to laminate something,
and the thing I like about the 15-inch roll is that every time I pull it off, it's square.
You know what I mean?
So, when you're going to put it in there, this is just, like, trying to laminate something.
But this is the process you would go with, like, if I was going to laminate this,
well, the first thing I would do is dust it off because it's good.
I don't know, I'm not good, dude.
I got 500 fucking things.
I got some guy that got here at 8 o'clock to interview me.
Yeah.
Yeah, I got it.
I just got too much going on, man.
I sold two solvent printers last week.
I need to get a ladder too so I can hang my banners on the wall.
I have a ladder to use it.
Let's be careful on it.
Anyways, you know, like, the dirtier your environment is, the more chances of it.
So, if this is like this, you can leave it out in the sun or, you know, flatten it out before you're going to use it.
It's a little easier.
If that's in your way, it doesn't have to be there.
That's for when you're doing laminate.
Doing what?
Laminate.
Laminate.
So, now that we have it going,
like, obviously, like, see how square that is going in right now?
If I think it was wrinkling and doing all kinds of crazy shit right now, I wouldn't just go for it.
You know what I mean?
Like, I would stop and, like, regroup the situation and, like, make sure I'm lined up.
Yeah, but here, give it a second.
So, now I want to laminate this.
What I would do is I would take it here,
get it, like, see, like, no, it's stuck up there.
So, like, having an, having an unsquare edge, you're at a disadvantage right out of the gate.
Like, you're already, you're just asking to fuck it up.
No, because I'm going to put it in there, but I'm going to show you what's going to happen.
Like, if you don't put it in there square, your chances of getting it good.
Like, what I got to do now is, like, I'm not even that concerned about if I hit it exactly right or left.
If I miss it by quarter of an inch, I don't really care about that so much.
I'm more interested in keeping this thing pulled apart and taunt and going in at the same time.
And normally, if it's flat, I would butt the whole thing right up in there and stop it.
You know what I mean, but now I can't.
So, I'm going to come back here and I'm going to hit the gas.
And I'm going to put it in there at the same time.
So, I'm putting it in there as it's moving.
Right.
And then I'm looking out the back, because I want to make sure it's...
See, it's stuck to the...
It got stuck to the roller and now it's stuck to the...
It's probably going back underneath because I didn't...
It's not all the way down there, but this thing is...
So, now it's stuck.
So, what you got to do is you need to reverse it.
You know what I mean?
So, we're going to hit the reverse button.
And then I'm going to hold pressure on this while I try and move it backwards and pull it out.
You know what I mean?
The reason that happened is because I let the material go into the roller without...
I need to have my backer...
I need to almost stick my...
My starting sheet under the backer of the sheet coming out.
So, you're not worrying about sticking it to the top of the roller and everything.
I got to back it up, so I'm going to hit the manual button right here.
Oh fuck, I can't even move it, dude.
So, it's stuck right here, look.
That's why I can't move.
It's not that bad.
I don't have any leverage.
It tore the laminate.
How much is left of that material?
No, no, I see it.
Oh, here, I'm going to lift this up.
I'm going to come back here and just pull this taunt on the backside.
Make sure...
Oh, this thing got moved, too.
I'll put this back to 69.
Let it back down.
Looks pretty good.
I see a little wrinkle at the top, but...
Oh, shit.
Reverse.
See, you got to stop it right there.
I'm not sure how that...
So, what's this stuff?
This regular paper?
Here, let's see this.
Hold that over there, what it needs to do.
So, feed that in there under the piece that's coming out, like that's going in.
If you can.
So, slide it up under there.
Look your fingers.
Now that you're under it, now spread your arms out like this.
Push it up in there, see?
You squirt up in there like that while you're kind of spreading it right here.
And then you put the gas on.
Let it grab it.
So, there's no time limit as to when you can stick your original in now.
You know what I mean?
So, now that we have everything squared up...
We could just go right in there and just feed it right in and just keep gas in it.
You don't need to see the numbers because if you're off my quarter inch on the edge, it's okay.
That's not going to cause a problem because you're not printing out there and you're not laminating and you're not cutting out there or whatever.
So, you'll get better at it as you go.
But what I would do right here, I'm going to slice this off right here.
I'm just trying to teach you a process where you don't fuck everything up that you're trying.
Yeah.
So, now that...
I've wasted two rolls in there.
All right, we'll look it.
See how it is right now?
I'm going to go like this.
I'm going to take it in to right...
See that beeper right there?
That's what this is right here is the auto pause.
Once that thing comes up, it stops it so it can't wind up into a fucking knot.
So, that's a good place to stop right there.
The beeping's in a noxious song and it... oh fuck.
Okay.
So, do you want to laminate it?
I'll show you how to do it.
I'll show you how I would do it.
So, you cut off this edge right here.
So, I would go like this.
There's my little raggy rag out there.
I ordered a couple cutting mats.
You want a thousand dollars from them?
No, I found them at...
My mind sure is going to figure a hundred and fifty bucks.
I found it for $79.
It's a piece of black DDC.
5D wide, 10D long.
So, I would take this right here and roll it up like this.
And now we've got, like, there's dust all over the back of it.
That we're contending with, you know what I mean?
So...
Yeah, I suppose.
So...
I'm going to try, I'm probably going to try and dust it up as I'm feeding it in there
because I normally, I want to have this a little tighter,
wrapped so I can grab a hold of it better.
So, I can drop it after a while, but I don't want to drop it because if it hits the floor,
it's going to get all fucked up, you know what I mean?
So, I would take this, feed it under there.
I let this go in too far earlier because I wasn't paying attention.
So, I'm about squared up right there.
And so, I'm taking this and I'm...
Okay, you're right here at 60.
Yeah, so I'm not, like I said before, I'm more concerned about this squared up part of it than the edges as far as that goes.
Right.
But I want to be close.
Yeah, so I pull it back.
So, like, I mean, this is your ticket right here.
You let the printer cut the shit off, you know what I mean?
And then...
Oh, damn, that's right.
Then cut it.
But I know what I do is I put it to, before I got it up, and I keep this and I just put my hand against this.
So, you know, yeah, yeah.
So, come over here and feel this, dude.
Like, grab a hold of it tight, pull it away a little bit and push it up in there.
And you'll feel like you feel like sitting right up in there.
So, once it's sitting up in there and you feel like confident where it's at,
you're ready to give it gas.
And then as you're giving it gas, you're going to be unrolling this.
And then, possibly, if you see a big chunk of dust or some shit in there,
you're going to beat that one, and dust it off as it's going in there.
That's why you, like, printing like all the way on the roll,
and then taking that whole roll off and printing through there,
you have, like, less chance of having that type of problem.
You know what I mean?
Like, there's a little dusty spot right there.
So, there's some blood over there on the thing.
Yes, from my home.
So, like, you can take it with one hand and hold it back and dust it off as you go,
or whatever, because right now, you're not doing anything.
It's doing all the work for you.
There's nothing you can really do at this point, so forgive it, gas.
And make sure it's not dusty when it flies in there.
Keep it on speed one, dude, even if it takes longer, but whatever.
You can go to two if you're doing a whole roll.
And, like, we haven't even talked about the heat yet.
Like, now you could probably apply heat, and now you get rid of the silvering in the background.
It'll see there's a piece of hair in this one.
Where are you right now?
Yeah, right in the fish, dude.
In the logo, it sucks.
Now, I stop it right there, and then put the next piece of paper in.
Well, this is where you got to decide what you're going to be doing.
Like, are you done laminating at this point?
So, yeah, you basically do the same thing.
You get it to here or there or wherever.
Like, that's perfect right there.
Go ahead and get your paper ready.
Shove it under there.
Step on the gas.
Pull it through till it's just under it.
And until this is out onto this table right here, so you can slice this off.
And then you can leave it.
Well, you can't leave it.
You're going to have to tape it on there again.
And so, you want to keep the...
You want to keep it off of the edge.
You don't want it all the way up in here where it's wrapping itself up around the rolling shit.
You know what I mean?
So, if you push it up in there snug and you feel good about it, then just step on the gas.
And stop.
That's okay.
So, like, that was what, 24-inch paper you're using?
Yeah.
That got you...
You still need to go more.
Like, look where you're at back here.
Yeah, so I need...
Well, like...
A wider piece.
Well, what's going to happen right now is...
This is what...
A lot of times, like with a sheet like this...
Right.
I'll laminate it by hand.
Not by hand.
The same process I showed you.
Get it square.
But then you shove it up in there.
Get it started.
And just hold the backer and roll it up in your hand as it's going through.
Let the document hang down to the floor.
Right.
And just pull the backer up.
If you're just doing a sheet of stickers, it's less wasteful, dude.
And you don't have to fuck around with all this weeding and everything.
You know, you have it cut to exact size of your media pre-done.
You just lay down the front edge.
Like, lay down the first three or four inches of it.
Flat and square.
And then just pinch it in there and get it started.
Pull the backer up and then just give it gas and pull the backer up.
Let it come out the rear.
Just make sure it clears the deck and it's coming out the back.
And then a lot of times with, like, not doing a lot,
that's the way I would do it.
I mean, look at it over here.
It looks good.
But you still got to come forward more,
because you need your registration marks right here for your cutter.
So you're going to need to put another piece of paper under it.
And then let that go through until, you know,
this gets down to this cutting line.
And then you should be able to slice it off right there.
And then when you give a gas next time,
all you got to do is just remember to tape it to the thing down here.
Come on, this thing.
That's a cool blade right there.
I need to get one of those.
It needs to be taught, I think, for it to.
You got to push down.
Like, the blade is in there, but you...
I think once you get through, you can pull it back.
Watch that, head down over there.
Yeah.
Hang on a second.
Hang it.
It's going to pull it through,
but this edge of this paper has got caught up there here a little bit.
Go ahead and go a little bit more.

---

## kelce_DJI_01_20251202_211901

Yeah, that's cool.
That's good.
Good, got her?
Yeah.
Nice.
So that's actually plenty, probably more than you needed to go.
But look back here, there's where your document is right here.
So you can just cut this off.
And like it wasn't so dirty in here,
you wouldn't really have to worry about putting it
on the take-up reel.
If you're just going to take it right back off,
I just wanted to show you the process.
So now you can cut this off.
You just want to keep it back behind this deck.
You know what I mean?
Let's say cut it off right here in this groove.
That way, when you hit the gas next time,
it's already coming out.
And then swing that.
You got to turn that and make sure it's facing out
so it can come out.
Got that.
Yeah.
I have to show you my new logo, bro.
I want to make it for my brand.
Oh, yeah, that's what I look at right now.
Oh, shit, the blade thought of this thing.
I don't know where it went.
Oh, sure here.
Does that make sense?
Yeah.
Same thing with this.
You got clutches back here, too.
So you want to have that snug, too.
And you also have this clutch here on your original
when you're putting it in.
And you want to have that breaking the same thing.
Because then everything is pulling back to square
and it has to go straight.
So even if you're off by an eighth of an inch or so
when you start, it'll square itself up, dude.
Within the first few feet, or a few inches.
And you can manually put pressure on it, too.
Hey, grab that really quick.
You're the other side of that.
Sixth of your shit, too.
I'm going to give this a go.
Chris was present.
Things cool.
Oh, that's your camera.
I was talking to him a little bit.
Dude, I'm going to try to figure out a way.
Like, is there anything in job or that you hate
that you wish it would do, but it doesn't?
Probably.
Well, it starts thinking about it.
I mean, it does a lot of things that I don't even
know what it does, dude.
I mean, like, I was going to do something that you
needed to do, and it doesn't do.
Let me know.
And I can't, uh, that's the things that I'm looking for.
Those types of shit.
I want to sit down with you.
So I want to sit down with you.
And I'm done.
I'm done with people in your office.
Dude, if we need any schedule, I don't want to trip.
I'm in your business.
What'd you say?
Can you go put it in my car for me?
I don't know what you're talking about.
You have to go put it in your car for me.
What customer are you talking about?
Anyone else?
There is a man in the street.
Are there machines down?
Oh, yes.
This is constantly jamming.
Oh, yeah.
Yeah, I need to put that in my car.
Yeah.
I'll grab it for you in the morning.
That was just too low to be slow.
Let me see, you, please.
I'm not really, I'm never going to address.
You know, that's what I'm talking about.
got it. Since we're going to be removing that printer and putting this printer and I
didn't want to set it up twice so I'm just going to set it up once once I reinstall it
where it's going to be. And then you can learn about it, too.
That's my desk, but we all sit there. Yeah, Joe sits there sometimes. Hey Robin,
I got your printer loaded up in the back of my truck. I was going to put it together this
morning, but I'm just going to put it together there since we got to put it on that table
and everything. I want to make sure that it gets where it's going to go in case you
got a tippet or something. I don't want to get any dripping or something like that.
So I'm all ready to go, but I got a few things I got to do on this side of town before
I leave. So probably going to not leave here for like an hour. So I think it's 930 right
now. Is that like a phone call? Oh, that's fine. Oh, I can just leave and you can have
your meeting and I can come back. 15 minutes. Yeah. That's cool. I mean, we can step out
while you have your meeting. It's fine. I don't want to drive around with your printer
in the back of my truck all day. So I'm going to try and come there first. And I don't
know how long it's going to take. So I want to give this plenty of time. Okay. Come off
Scottsdale. Okay. Yeah, I know. This printer is heavy as hell, man. I was shocked.
So I just put it in the back of the printer. Okay. We'll figure it out. I got to bring any
guy with me too. So yeah. Okay. All right, man. Okay. Bye. Yep.
Yeah, sweet. So I was like reflecting last night. And do you know we've known each other
for almost three years? Has it been that long? Do crazy, right? I know. I'm trying to remember
like I think I was mostly working out of my house when I met you guys. Yeah. So you just
move to this shop. Okay. Like right around that same time because you sent me an address
to the old shop. That was like my Walmart or something. So this is Java. Yes. So I Joe was
walking me through that. And he said the map is a really handy feature. And so when I sit
here and look at this, I'm overbooked for today. See how it says unscheduled unscheduled, there's
a filter I can turn that off. So we have an unscheduled thing that goes to the things that
are out of town. So show unscheduled. I don't want to show that show. So how do you like
Java? I mean, I like it for this reason right here. Like this is my day. Like the way that
we use it, I've got these filters over here, right? So we each have a person and then we
have a division. So like anything that has to do with me is usually going to service. So
I can filter the schedule, but not see everything on my schedule. Like this is all that's on
my list for today of things I got to do. I got a city of Glendale. I got to install this
printer for this guy. When I pick on it, I can tell this guy, hey, I'm on my way. You
know, I just pick on this and however long the GPS tells me I hit send. And then I go
here and I punch in directions. You know, so now I know it's going to take me 50 minutes
to get there. So you like the map integration? Is that your favorite tool? No. What is your
name? So I'm showing you right now. Like, like, so what the fuck? He is going to hit back.
Where? Oh, there's Java. Okay. So when I pull up, it tracks my time. So it's got a geofence.
So it starts to timer. So in case I'm not paying attention, like fence to clock in as it pulls
up, use the address for reference. So automatically clocks you in and get that geofence. Yeah.
So like when I'm there, I'm looking at this. So I got my visit. Alyssa puts my notes
right here. So Rob and Silver is my contact. So I can check out if I want to. And this
is what I'm doing. I got the install for 950. I got a processing fee on there. And there's
my team. So Kelsey and service are on there. So like, service, like things I don't have
to do right now that I'm working on. I keep in the service schedule and keep bumping
them forward. Right. And then I can just look at my Kelsey sketches. I don't get overwhelmed
feeling. Right. And then from right here, the details, this takes me to the company's
information when we have like custom fields of the people. I can go to their address information
right here. I can do most of the stuff from here, like which everyone's start is the one
that's going to get text from here. I could text the guy from right here. And then she
can text him and we all can be texting right here in one location. So gotcha. So that's
powerful to every all the text is all the messages get sent to everybody. But one if you call
this phone number, you're texting it forward straight to my office number. So you just
get picked up. So you can call the number dial extension or you can text it and it receives
pictures and all that. So I really really like that. And then like, so another thing I
like about it is from the home view, like as I'm as I'm finishing jobs and stuff like
that, like when I go to this Arizona, when I get when I get finished here, I can complete
the visit. And it says invoice now or later, I say later because she puts my notes and
she she's dealing with the billing and all that shit. So it goes into a queue basically
of things that she still needs to do today, like things that have been invoiced. And so
like at the end of every day, like right, Alyssa, at the end of every day, like if I say
I completed a job, you have a list over there you're looking at saying like this has to
be invoiced or. So at the end of the day, you get his service list and then he just
while I'm doing it, every time I leave a job, I call her and fill her in on it because
I try and keep her in the loop. I try and keep her in the loop of everything I'm doing
because her memory is not good. And if I don't, if she has no idea what's going on at
all, it's even more confusing. So I try and like call her and explain to her what to
do. And then she takes notes down. Then she's like, okay, now she's put together quotes
for me that I got a review to send. And like, there's just there's so many. Okay, this
is cool though. This is exactly what I'm looking for. So quick question. When he sends you
that report, you're writing them down, right? Well, she's, she's, she's jotting them
down quickly so she can, then she goes to her, okay, cool, awesome, perfect. And then
she transcribes it into job or and everything that we do, I want it to be in job or so
if we're going to be doing something like I'm working on this prayer next door, the
other thing I like about it is this right here, I can show you this, I'm going to cancel
right here. So say I finished this job, but I'm not done. It's like, dang, I need more
part. What I'll do is I'll come over here, I'll schedule a new visit for tomorrow. And
then I can complete this visit. So every time I showed up at this place, it's like a
job and it keeps a track of the history of everything I did. So, and then when I come
over here, I have my notes. So when I'm doing the job, I take a bunch of pictures and then
I come in here and I add the note and I add all the pictures of all the work that we,
that was done. So where are the invoices? To the end of this when you're entering this
versus what you're sending to listen. No, I've already entered all my notes and she didn't
there. But what are you sending to Alyssa that she's writing down on a sticky note?
So occasionally he calls when he, like when I leave and they got like, yeah. So occasionally
he calls when he stops the client, he doesn't have a phone or we're striving, he can't
do it himself, he calls, he gives me all the information, tells me, okay, so I need
you to make a quote and we, this, for this client, include this, this, and this. I drop
that down, okay, cool, bye, I'll get that done. Then I put it down.
So the way this onboarding system works, and just so you know, we have developed started
an agency to help efficient, make things systems more efficient. Communication. So, no, it's
a difficult thing. It's the worst thing. Yes, we're using AI, but AI is the sizzle. It
ain't the steak, right? I don't want to come, like we are AI consultants or AI, an agency,
but ultimately what I'm trying to do is build your own software for Kelsey and plotter mechanics.
So this is exactly what I need. So when you send her the tickets, you're having to call.
What does she doesn't answer? What happens? Do you do the voicemail? She's very good
to answer, but if she does, I text her. So how, when do you prefer him, we may have voicemail
versus you having to write it down. I mean, she probably, okay, so then, how many times
do you say out of five times, he sends the invoice or information that you don't get it?
Are you away from your phone or something like? If she's anywhere, she's at lunch. Is there
a gap where sometimes the information does it get translated correctly and now we build
out an invoice incorrectly and we lost an opportunity? Does that happen often? I mean, not
often, but I mean, some stuff slips through the cracks. But if he texts or he leaves a voicemail
and I don't understand, I mean, he's in the column. Yeah, awesome. Yeah, because I have
a difficult time communicating sometimes when I'm overwhelmed. You know, I'm being barred
by just 500 things in the traffic and how do you like using your voice message? Like, do
you know how you can send a text message by recording yourself? I never do that. I just,
I basically send text messages that don't make sense a lot of times. Can you just try
instead? Like, do you know how to send it? Yeah, totally. When we develop systems, I'm
trying to get these AI voice agents to do a lot of the heavy lifting. I think we talked
about enough of a quarter here to trans, like to cord the office environment. So like,
for instance, yesterday, she had told you about paper that you needed to put on the truck.
Well, that agent would have said, Hey, Kelsey, before you leave, did you grab the paper for
the truck? I mean, that kind of stuff sounds cool to me. I think that's cool. So that,
but that's what I'm trying to say. You know, like I was a perfect instance this morning
about what I'm trying to help you. So I have to refrain from suggesting anything.
What do you know about managing the data? Because before you came along, there was a guy
that was working with my church. And he was putting some API thing together in the back
end that had a whole database of all my information, because I have another database.
You paid like five grand for that. Seven grand. Where is that?
It's I have a folder. Yeah, I do. Okay. Would you would you be would you think it would
be like a situation or a hey, I am working for Kelsey. He asked me to reach out as a
his consultant for this. Yeah. Can we can we do that? And you would I can work as a consultant
for you? Yeah. I think I think I could get him to help me at least, at least educate
you on what he was doing. Yeah. Because I literally have no idea what he was doing.
He spent seven grand. Yeah. So let me not let that go to waste. Yeah. Let's use that
as because I would be really curious to see what data sets he pulled already. Yeah.
Because he had no he had access to everything. Like he was he was he was he was basically
building a database. That was going to connect Shopify, Java, um, basically the whole
back in there was going to be a portal that we would be able to work through. Yep.
And then we would start marketing and doing all this shit. But I never saw any results.
I just kept I stopped paying him every week was something else. He's like, I got to do
this. Basically what happened is I don't think that he understood the complexity of what
I'm actually dealing with on my website with all the different cartridges and model numbers
and all the information. So he said he could do it. But then since we built our website
improperly from the get go, we didn't have the I don't know how they call it, but there's
categories and they call it different things. And we didn't have it that way. For instance,
like we sell paper by the role, but it comes in a two pack. So you can't the inventory management
system kind of fucked up. Do you have an inventory management? No. So there's no inventory
management system. No, it's crap. They have account of what's inside each box and a list.
Our inventory system is garbage. It doesn't work. You can't use it. It's completely
unusable. And I have no fucking clue what I have in stock. Yeah. What do you use to
manage your inventory? Nothing. No, quick books. Nothing. Nothing.
It's nothing. Right there. Good. There. That's what I saw that board. So I was curious
about it. Because it's it's incorrect. I rubbed my arm against the board. What am I wiping
out? Okay. Cool. Okay. So guys, this is these are exactly what like I'm already thinking
about creating again, I got a refrain from what my wife is in the process of right now,
like working with a bookkeeper and like working with a bookkeeper and getting my taxes
and shit in line. And starting January 1st, we're starting with a fresh clean quick
books. Oh, so you have your reconciles reconciles? She's going to deal with all of that.
Yeah. The book keep a $700,000 difference in our quick books. It was fucking crazy,
dude. Like, holy shit. I didn't know how hard it was to reconcile your fucking books.
No, it sucks. I can't do it. Okay. So this is all good. So anyways, she's dealing with
that. So January, we're going to start over from scratch. And I want to I got all these
printers over here and parts and pieces. And I don't have an inventory system. Like if
I knew what I had in stock, I could sell it on eBay and all kinds of shit, but I can't
do anything with it. Okay. So I'm just going to go start going over the basic. So that
thing that he was dealing with was going to have all my inventory. It was going to be
a portal where I was going to be able to add my products, put my images and it was going
to populate all of the different Shopify QuickBooks jobber with one click. Do you know what
I'm talking about? Yeah. That's that's where I was building, but I couldn't work with
the guy, bro. I couldn't manage him. So I, um, he's got the he's got a whole folder full
of his shit. I don't know where it's at. Nikki has it. I'm going to ask her for it. I
took it home. Yeah. Okay. What's that guy's name? John. No, I was. Oh, no. What was
that guy's name that worked for me? The guy that was a web dude that didn't do anything.
Malik. Malik. Hey, do you have that packet of information? Malik gave me after I let
him go at the house somewhere. Question mark. Um, I was about to find it, but I he wanted
me to have all the information. He, he was like adamant about it. Dude, I don't give
a shit about your information. Like, you know, all it's going to happen is I'm going
to go to someone else. They're going to tell me all this bullshit and that they got
a whole other way to do things. And I'm sorry to go through that experience and it makes
my job more difficult, right? But honestly, it makes me better. And this is why we're doing
this, right? You're helping me get better. Ultimately, I'm here to make you more money,
right? That's my plan. When I make you more money, I get paid. And that's how I'm going
about it. But I am seeing the dollar signs and I have to refrain from making any suggestions
right away because ultimately it's not me who's going to modify your operational plan.
It's the team, right? So I have, Macau, he is a systems like engineer, right? He develops
systems, right? He works for the Air Force. He's done contracts with the Pentagon. I have
Trent. He is a robotics engineer. Like, he can build, it's called IOT, Internet of Things.
So that recording system, the camera system that we talked about, like anything you
mind can fathom, like he does industrial communication, industrial programming, industrial,
like shit. I'd be really curious to see what kind of system he can put together for you
just in the hardware itself, like the printers, the scanners, like all of your gadgets, I would
assume are just connected to your network. And the only way you can communicate to your hardware
is via protocol through your Windows database, like to pull up your printer specs, you have to
go to the queue or the app inside your deal, right? Oh, no, you just got to the printers. They all
got wet. Yeah, but I'm trying to make that out. Like, would you, would you like to see all your
printers on one dashboard? And like, like, yeah, and again, I'm just, I don't know what these
guys are capable of. And then I got Matthew. This guy used to work for Amazon. He helped build
Amazon's environment to my, what I'd be, I'll show you their websites. They have their own.
I'm just the guy to help the acquisitions. Now I, you know how I've been since for three years
from now each other. I have been chasing this dream, ultimately, to kind of just help make
connections. And it's been working. And now I developed my first software intellectually.
Didn't know how to really develop it. That's when I paid for this program. That's where I met
these cats. So we're all paid a lot of money just to get into this room to ultimately
help us figure out our own goals. I just so happened in my first week met these guys. And I was
like, it was like meant to be. Yeah. Like I honestly truly feel that I have God's hand and
people's hand on my shoulders. And I'm guiding me along this path. And I'm hearing your problems.
And I'm seeing the opportunity. So what we are working out right now and why I have all these
cameras and, you know, this is like literally the beginning to our agency. You are going to be our
first client that we are going to use this as our rollout method, our onboarding process.
Right. So I appreciate that. And I don't take it lightly. Right. So I took the time last night.
We have these processes. Right. So we have this five question for us to pretty almost hone in
on your constraints. Right. And then the other pages I put together, I did some market research
for you about the opportunities that you shared with me about your wanting to expand a little bit.
But you can't expand if you don't have the processes in person in place to support this expansion.
Right. That you're creating a fucking headache. So what my thought in my plan is let's let's get
this thing. Let's get this shop tuned in, dialed in. Right. So it makes a list of life a whole
lot easier where now she can be working on the business, not in the business. Right. Yeah. And then
same thing with you. Like I and ultimately if we can illustrate to you, Kelsey, that we say to
you or made you a significant amount of money more every month by integrating our systems.
That gives you the ability to level up. It gives you the information. I can afford another 50
dollar coin. He's going to be this this and this and my margin state the same of what I was used to
before. But you can't make those calculations because you don't ultimately know the bottom and
your operational cost or data operation. Yeah. Well, I'm going to have that information here in
January. I should have it fine tuned finally because you don't know how much assets and
inventory you have. No, I don't have that part of it. So that's let's focus on that side now.
Now you're getting your books reconciled and your cash flow statements going. Now let's see how much
money you really have sitting in just inventory. Your machines do know how much each one of these cost.
I don't know. That's what I'm trying to get. No, I don't have any. I think let's start there. So I'm
going to go through these questions. So the first one is the biggest problem. Kelsey, for
plotter mechanics, what is the single biggest operational or financial friction in the business right
now? The problem that keeps you working late. I do everything. I mean, I do everything. I come in
here. I load all this crap into my car. I drive it all over town. I fix everybody's printers while
my phone is blowing up all day long trying to communicate with Alissa between stops and then
fight traffic for an hour. Like last night, you know, one hour to commute home. Like I'm trying to
train Joe. So I can at least split the tasks, you know, so I've been spending time with him working
harder. I'm so exhausted of pouring myself into people like I'm like that's the last dude I'm
pouring myself into man. Like I'm done. So I'm going to I'm going to try and teach him some things.
So he could do half of the jobs at least right off the gate. Half of my task could be alleviated
from me tomorrow. Once I let him lose, I just have been trying to train him and teach him a little
bit more. So I was talking to Joe about that a little bit because you don't have any SOPs. You don't
have any systems in place to make one task redundant. Right. For instance, loading paper, whatever
jobs that need to be done here. First, before moving out into the field, like you don't have
those types of systems in place. Right. For what I gather from talking to Joe, there's no
I mean, we do like as I'm going through the ship with a list all day, you know, she's she's
contacting me saying, hey, let's go over your schedule for tomorrow. You know, like, yeah, this job,
that job, this part, that part, and it's all on yourself over there. I have a shelf that floats
over there that she gets it all right. So all I really have to do is come in, load it in my car
and go. Cool. Cool. So no, I don't think so. I don't know. But do we have the parts?
Are they on the show? So I depends on how I don't think so. That's what I was telling Joe,
like, how cool would it be to have plot of accountants is all like app and, like, say, like,
when you are ready to start onboarding people, the hardest part about onboarding somebody is
a training. How do you get them up to speed? It takes you another week to weeks of training,
right? What if I would have spent time and energy and developing a system to train
people to follow a step-by-step guide to do mundane tasks that need to be done around the shop,
right? But the problem is that you have to spend another dollar, meaning hiring a
have another employee to hold that employee's hand, right? Well, instead of putting that dollar
on an employee that has to keep habitually doing it every single time somebody comes through the
doors as a hire. Well, let's just give them a log in and now they have this app that walk them
through the base responsibility of your position. Oh, and you need to know how to load paper or
printer. Here, here's, here's the printer on your app. Here's all the things you need to know
about this printer. It's all right here. Manuals, instructions, videos, how to load the paper,
what you know what I mean? Like, break it down to that kind of level to help retain quality.
I think that's been one of your point, pain points that you mentioned in the past is that you
can't find quality help, right? And this gives you the ability to at least start finding that
quality. I mean, I guess the problem is like, it's not that I can't maybe find quality help,
it's that I need, I mean, I can't hire somebody and not give them what you said. You know,
a list of things to do. Like, I just expect people just to figure out what to do and just do it.
That's not happening. That's how we operate. But the problem is, Kelsey, is that we leave it
up to interpretation.

## kelce_DJI_01_20251202_214949

cost you money oh yeah lots of it yeah yeah and we are trying to have all these
sips and we're just trying to make that funnel fucking me proof yeah so I got a
really good idea of your base problem now the cost of that problem based on
your experience how much is this problem whether it's due loss revenue
unexpected maintenance the labor costs the cost of business per month what would
be your estimated value on that problem just think about all the problems that
you're having how much do you think you're losing every month off of those
problems oh I don't really know I mean I'd probably only lost like $10,000 last
year it's total 10,000 last year in total oh maybe 20 okay okay maybe more but
yeah I made a lot of bad decisions last year actually okay let's just
start over the month of what we talked about the problem is the the biggest
problem is that I'm the only one that knows anything about a printer here so
if anybody calls my company out of all the fingers I have out there right now
illicit and handle supplies orders you know and basic things but at the end of
the day like I have to talk to the person I have to sell the person I have to go
fix the I have to do everything bro if I if I don't come to work we're not
making any more I see so the but the business just creeps to a halt and
within a couple of months we'd be out of business so you're right I mean like
yeah yeah illicit could do some like maintenance she's knowledgeable but
she's not the person that you know a lot of a lot of like what you do here is
selling people confidence so out of the technical work that service calls that
you get how much of that is like if you rank the technicality of that service
call out of that range then what is there a way to determine the if the
problem is at your caliber or Joe's caliber yeah or a list is caliber like
a zero oh yeah yeah yeah to some degree I mean a lot of things that I get
involved in I don't even know what I'm doing oh I've never even seen the
printer dude not even know what it is never seen it never heard of it I just
went and saw on yesterday I never scared the shit out of me dude I saw this big
giant dusty ass thing I was like it looks like a piece of garbage dude like the
heads are three thousand dollars a piece and there's twelve of them and they're
all bad and this lady wants me to save the day it's like there's no
miracle workers out there but I can't send Joe over there like I couldn't
even make something out of it you know what I mean so I don't know what I'm
getting into I just go to everything and then things happen dude and that
and that's another thing too like a lot of my opportunities that I gain
come from being out there you know so I'm like if I'm driving to this place
and then right next door as another dude I'm over there giving business cards
you know so like I was just this week I was we were coming back totally yeah
that's that is that where you find your enjoyment when you're working your
business I like going to places talking to the owners of the companies finding
where their pain points are leaving my business card and then later on I get
a call I have in this week so you know I dropped a card off this lady and then
I got a call ag me printing and I was like ag me printing I go back to my
notes I look I think I look at the address like no shit man I dropped a
business card over there like three weeks ago three months ago and now they're
calling me you mentioned your notes what do you mean where do you
where's your notes like what notes are you storing text messages history like I
went back like when I when I get a new like if I get a contact I send it to
Alyssa I say hey take a picture I send it to her I say can you add that to the
database send him an introduction email give him my contact I give him a
for me she has that process look Alyssa does that work out pretty well when he
does that when he sends you a business card to fill out I guess
when I meet him I try like I wouldn't say we're there yet but I try and I'm
I'm extremely adamant about her when she's on the phone like she can't get
their cell phone numbers but I can't I'm like hey I need your cell phone
number and I'm gonna send you a text message right now because I don't want to
be sitting in this dude's driveway where I can't get through and no one's
answering the phone you know like I'm not gonna solicit your shit or I'm not
gonna send you marketing or all that but when I send that message I'll be there
in 45 minutes like you better be there right like yeah and and and and so I I
want all of the communication to be through job but then what happens is like
people open the messages and don't do anything about it and then don't then it's
fucked you know what I mean like people read the message but don't don't handle
it and don't market as unread and then nobody sees the message so you have to
I skim the job or text messages every morning I sit in my when I sit in the
hot tub in the morning I go through job or message communications I go through
my text messages back till like a couple days because I there's things in there
I'm dealing with that aren't finished yet I have like a bunch of I don't even
look at my inbox anymore bro no I can't look at it's too much I she's she's
dealing with most of it I skim it just to make sure I'm not missing an
opportunity but the rest of it like cleaning it getting rid of the junk
males like so listen when you're going through his emails how did he get a
report of his email she calls me it's it basically if there's something that
needs to be handled I just tell their call me because otherwise I'm not looking
at my email for hours on end and text messages even I get overwhelmed
Microsoft so it's all your environments do Microsoft 365 so you have a
Microsoft 365 account yes next question timeline and future how long have
you been dealing with this particular problem and if you didn't don't take
action in the next six to twelve months what does the future of your business
look like I've been telling this problem since the beginning of time since I
first ever had a business oh it's probably been 20 years now but just you
know I thought with this drive to technology and everything things would get
more easier to do but the every piece of technology I add in my business makes
it more complicated and more messed up dude it's just there's too many pieces
like there's there's a website there's the database there's the CRM there's
the interface with the cut you know job or now we've got like all these
different things they don't have the same information so like I've got
capsule quickbooks job or Shopify all have different information some's got
some shit over here some's got it over there I got outlook I got text messages
I got a text message on my cell my business number as a text number job
as a text number I have a text number nobody calls the office hardly ever they
call my cell phone even though they out of the numbers they call myself because
they know that they're gonna get results so do you have a private number to
no no because people don't really bother me on the weekends you know like
it's just during business hours when there's money to be made I want to be
available to take the calls like I'd nothing I hate worse than calling a place
and get fucking voicemail and I don't I go to the next place bro and that's where I
get a lot of my business actually honestly the reason I get a lot of my
businesses because people call in I got her trained now to where she knows I'm
out there she knows where I'm at she's got the mapping front of her and she's
like hey Kelsey there's a call that came up in tempi I'm gonna throw on your
schedule real quick if you can make it by there today boom
bingo and I've already got like my schedule I already know who needs what who I
can push back who's not desperate and shit in their pants but see that
stuff doesn't happen unless you got a brain behind it you know that's not
happening you got to have somebody with common sense that's like okay
Kelsey's in tempi today and then this call just came in there in tempi maybe I
should call Kelsey and tell him like before I listed came along and we had
job or all this shit going on this guy over here would write it on a note I'd
be out in Mesa I'd come back tomorrow and the next day he'd be like oh yeah
Jim Bob called for me so I'm like dude I was five minutes from there yes
that you dickhead like now I'm gonna be driving for another two hours you
don't give a shit about me you show up late to work every day and then I got a
drive for four hours because of it and lose thousands of dollars like do you
see Kelsey's location on the jobber's map is it provide you a I mean she has
my cell phone right there she could look at my location I don't but as she
could I don't she doesn't need to know where I'm at she knows about where I'm at
by looking at the map because like show him what you're looking at like
jobber looks different on us what her her screen like I can't even use the
computer version of it hardly I it does more things it's more it's yeah it's
just the cell phone is more simplified I mean look what she's looking at look
at her thing I mean I can't look at all those numbers and shit it's too much
man you can filter it and turn off certain things if it's overwhelming but
I'm gonna ask you this question I want to ask you to ask Liska if there was a
magic wand solution if I gave you a magic wand and you can build a perfect no
compromise solution to fix any problem what specific tour system would that
work like that if we could get the infant for end or that would be fantastic
that's your magic wand say so because then he's gonna call me he's gonna say hey I
need you to prepare this and listen this do we have this and then I can just look
over now she's like oh do you have this she's running like back and forth
okay and what's your magic wand if you had a magic wand what would what problem
would you wait or solve with one way a reliable field tech that can go on and
alleviate 50% of my daily responsibilities because I'm just I can't do it I
got I can't do anything new I don't want to do anything like I'm trying not to
do things you know what I mean because I'm trying to like well yeah if I get
more work business to get freedom and I never really have had freedom but I'm
actually at a place now in my business because I started with basically nothing
you know I got some stubborn so no loans no nothing and so now I'm at a point
where I have steady cash flow and like I'm not at least my my worry isn't like
how I'm gonna pay for the bills or whatever like I'm not looking I have all the
things in tools I need to do what I need to do you know I have inventory I have
parts you know like I I don't want to inventory all these parts but I have
parts for jobs that I need and I I got my little niche you know but magic
wand yeah think about that while you think about that I would say like I would say
the rest when you think about it well it's it's basically just it's a it's a
it's a more centralized way of communicating like it's just really difficult to
keep track of all of the things that were going on in in the day I think that
in in most companies you have you know one person is only handling supplies and
one person's only handling this and one's only handling and that and we're
handling like we're juggling like everything all the time because we only have
the two of us really you mean and I think we're getting a lot done based on
the circumstances I'm not dissatisfied with that I'm just tired of being the
only one that's responsible all the time but at the end of the day I think
that's just the way it is as that one you're gonna end up being that guy with
the end with the with the actual customer like they're probably you know like
it's kind of stressful like I deal with a lot but I watch like you have to do
you got to do the job it's got to be reasonable for the customer to want to
pay it to you know what I mean like like if I if I go out and do a job and it
takes me three hours or I send something that's unknowledgeable doesn't know
what they're doing it takes them two days you know like who's gonna pay you
know like is the customer gonna pay for all the mistakes that that guy made
because he doesn't have 25 years of experience like that's so so if you're so
funny because we were we're talking I got 25 years of experience of tricks up
my sleeve bro so that came up with our development team yesterday how do we
charge people and so what we're doing what I haven't talked to him and now
hey guys we're gonna talk you on this subject is that my thought is same
thing for a mechanic right a mechanic has to change an alternator if we let's
say our alternator is a simple implementation of an API or build something for
a customer right I know our guys can associate that one task to an hour really
rate just like a mechanic there's a standard hourly rate to change an
alternator there's a standard hourly rate to change a wheel bearing a break you
know the same like there's I think it's the automotive industry standard of
billable hours now if that mechanic is so good because he spent 15 years
changing brakes and he can change a break in 30 minutes but they're able to
bill 2.5 hours that's the profit right same shit with you yeah I feel like we
should and this is what I want to talk to my team about is we develop our for
lack of better term hourly rate for specific jobs aka building something out
for you oh because it sounds like we have a change of a print head paper okay
paper is to say 25.25 of an hour a print head is usually at 1.75 right so you
give a denominating value for every task that will ultimately say okay this is
actually five billable hours if I get it down in three I'm making money the
customer doesn't need to know that but at least we are creating that margin so we
know fuck I spent five and a half hours I actually I didn't lose money but I
could have made more money for the next time and maybe have a system where you
can say hey next time let's do this instead of that we would have saved an hour
you know what I'm saying like be able to make your your systems your because if
we from what I'm hearing if very reconfigure out of the way to replicate you and
if all that takes is by wearing a camera while you service these printers and then
now you have a digital recording of how the ship works if you're talking to
yourself as that ready this is when I am yeah they got cameras now you can just
clip on your shirt yeah good and they're so small yeah you wouldn't even like
you would like that is bigger bigger than that yeah and now you have a digital
reference that your next service guy your next service call can follow hey well
I would like to take all those videos and put them online bro but see what's
happening right now and and you know I got Joe I hired Joe and I was like Joe
you gotta go through and post all these ads online for me post all these
printers that we have for sale we post them high you get to our name out there
but now I'm getting calls from like other states you know remote support like
I'm doing like remote telephone calls and charge people like a hundred
seventy five bucks to talk to them on the phone they're happy to pay because I
could I could I just hear you say you get paid for consulting somebody over the
phone and you don't have to leave your office yeah I could be doing that all day
long if I if I focused on that from to be honest with you dude like I'm tired
of this driving around the city and chasing all this whatever I if I could
figure out how to optimize the web right keep my service business running
down here move to pine top sit upon the porch of my pint looking at the
pine logs and sit there with my earbuds on and just be like hey what's up you
know FaceTime me let's go you know like can I have a spot up there with you and
then we can have one of those mornings together yeah but that's what I I mean
like as I'm doing more of it you know it's like remote service like I could be
somewhere else right I'm not fighting traffic back and forth and there's so
many people out there that are do it themselves or is that want to do it
themselves but they need some help you know and like how teaching people I
like I enjoy training people so what if what if we created like another version
of the polymath world right where you have become the mecca of knowledge or you
built your name about just fixing printers and there's a particular job you
necessarily don't want but you know another service tech that I have this
idea I have this repair I really don't have time for it would you be
interested in taking that work on I do it all the time I mean I I have other
guys that work for me in a contract it is not morally unacceptable it is not
morally wrong for you to do that no I I what I do is I you know like I know
what it's like like when you're caught your machine broke and you need that
thing to work and you can't get there till Tuesday but you've got a guy that
yeah I people call me with that I don't I'm not looking for the work but they'll
call me and be like hey if I'm out and I'm like hey if you have problem that
cop you're calling me and then I guess the customer service so I you know like
we we basically charge the same rate so we charge 250 for a service call and
that guy charged me 150 I make a hundred bucks he makes his rate I don't do
anything yeah the inventory like just the whole process of even taking an
order and the API thing that what's the name we're gonna like I had my hopes up
really high about it because all the shit he told me sounded great but just
the constant not seeing anything ever happened and whatever I just I just gave
up but I'll let you talk to Malik I'll reach out to him and I'll text him
let's make this very importantly aware that the reason why Kelsey did not like
his deliverable is because the frequency of conversation to you of the
status of the project because there was no status update that you can
physically see I mean I got a bunch of status updates every week but there's
nothing I nothing ever physically came to fruition you know like some bullshit
like template that didn't work and the idea behind it was good and I you know
I was throwing my ideas like I like it like this yeah that's cool oh oh you
know the website all wrong oh we got to read oh you know so now he's like
fumbling around with the website read and he and he changed a whole bunch of
stuff in the website because of what I told you about the groups or however
that shit is in there so he didn't realize how big a of a problem that was
gonna be it's not my fault he didn't know I was like look then just make it
work with like four products that I sell the most common ones just show me that
work with four that's what finally got to that and then just I was looking at
your website last night actually yeah oh it sucks too there's nothing good
about my website this is the same problem yeah but it's right here in front of
me we're gonna have the same problem with SNS full checks like we're gonna
develop their same literally legitimately the same situation although they
don't sell prints but the foundation of the overall company which company oh
your dad's company yeah same situation so I am literally starting at the
ground the foundation right and working my way up and and that's that's that's
my method of
I mean the only I do I like jobber but everything out like I have a whole
another CRM that has shitloads of emails contact information no well we
transition to jobber and it's still I still use it because I have all my
passwords in all of my yeah but not much like 40 bucks 30 bucks and it's it's
actually pretty powerful program no I agree I don't want I don't want to pay
for it if I don't have to it's a pretty powerful program but I just don't it's
too powerful you know what I mean like it's got all these capsule yeah and they
have a whole like CRM integration I'm not marketing integration where you
can do like all that AI bullshit well when I started the company over the
first time I did it I used I don't even know what I did man I I used quick
books professional eventually but an outlook and just word of mouth I built I
built that thing up what was the question you asked me just like what was the
difference that you like capsule versus oh so when I started over I was like I
had kind of like not worked for a year so like I was and I had to
relaxed and since it was my company I never I didn't really present myself as
the owner all the time because that sucks you know and I mean I just be like a I
present myself as a worker well my ex-wife owned it and I was just a worker so I
just acted like a worker I didn't you know I just kind of so when I started
over and I started like cold calling and stuff I was like calling the same
people like over in the same day like oh shit like how am I gonna keep track of
this you know so I did a little bit of research and I was like well quick book
sucks and I did some CRM research and the first one that somebody would
actually contact me and help me with was capsule so they got me on the phone
they gave me a little rundown they helped me get my information show me how to
import my that's this that's the second time I heard in two days one guy pays
40 G's a year for his software for his CRM but he does like heavy steel
fabrication I talked to him last night but he paid 40 grand a year because the
agent gave him his login walked him through the process pretty much folded his
hand for the first two months and then you got a 40 thousand dollar year
contract out of it because of it and what you're telling me is you signed up
over because of that fact then I tried to use it but I couldn't get the people I
worked with to implement and use it with me so I'm just using it alone talking
about your co-workers employees he's not here anymore but so use that my
sister long gone evolve she got it all set up for me but it was just over
complicated it did it was lacking a whole bunch of features that job her
head and she was already using job her for her husband's a carpet cleaning
business but job her doesn't do a good job with job her does no integration with
the website like you could build like a service-based website that's just like
I want my carpet clean but if you want to have products and shit they don't deal
with that so but it handled the texting from one location you know it handled
the map it handled the taking the notes you know like I'd put I'd have to
log into quick books put my notes in and then I have to go into capsule and do
some other shit and it was just too much stuff on the phone for me I'm like I
don't want to do this man like I'm tired of my phone so job her brings it all
into one location but I still but I still because of the the data being skewed
all over we haven't brought all of our garbage into job her so all of our
database still has all the shit in it and job her just has what's in QuickBooks
but I have my whole database of my old clients you know it's old now but I
still have all emails and phone numbers and all that I could be marketing and
telling them hey I'm over here hey I've got compatible links hey check this
out make videos dude like you should you should put these in your printer
because I'm gonna come over there and help you here's myself here's my number
here's my so what I'm also hearing here is that you're gonna need some sort
of media agency as well to kind of manage your videos but then also that can
turn your daily output which would be you wearing a camera yeah yeah that is
opportunity for marketing well that can all turn into something that's gonna be
web-based sales but we got to get the internal parts of it dropshipping
because like my inks for instance I could drop shit my inks directly from the
manufacturers they already have my labels I they label it so they could just
dropship it for me I could I could automate it to where an order comes in gets
paid PO gets sent over dropship information they label it ship it we don't
even have to touch it that's what I want to do so let me ask this question
before I do okay so we I don't think we're elaborated on your idea of the
magic wand can we go over that real quick oh the magic wand would just be
basically a way to get communication to happen properly I mean like every
all your systems all your getting all of my pieces to communicate with each
other so that we can communicate with each other better as a team yeah not
have 500 different fucking things here and there and whatever like I just
want one hub where I go and that's what that thing that I was building for me
was supposed to be and but I was like well his thing doesn't do all the
things jobber does so like let me let me use the jobber for my field service
stuff yeah like when she has to add a product she's got to add it into quick
books jobber shopify I've already thought of this I think when we first
talked when we print out those trifles like seven weeks ago I just didn't
know how to do it yeah I still don't know how to do it but I got guys who do
and I can't wait for them to see well Malik I'm gonna get you to talk to Malik
about what he did for me because he has all the database and all this shit
and I'm gonna I'll initiate the conversation with Malik yeah and then what I'm
gonna do is have Malik talk to the guys yeah the developers the guys who
actually know what the fuck he's talking about yeah yeah because I mean I spent a
lot of money and if there's any way to recover any of that work that he did
no no 100% we're not gonna let that go to waste for nothing okay good well
he he did a bunch of work in Shopify and he was he was struggling along but I
just couldn't keep paying to me hundred bucks a week to right so quick
question now the last one the core of the why you choose to build this business
in a tough high-stakes logistical market what's the story behind potter
mechanics and what drove you to make the direct access rental or like selling
the e-commerce like the prints and all that stuff like what drove you to do that
to start a business well why did you start the business like ultimately we
knew that you started working and servicing printers and then that just got
expanded on right well no what happened is I worked at a company for the first
10 to 12 years of my corporate life and I hated it I hated working in the
office environment I hated all the office drama and bickering that went on
there I hated the way that people acted when the boss was there and wasn't
there and I just didn't fit into that environment I I like to go out and work I
always gotten paid but I think that I was really getting out of it was a sense
of accomplishment you know what I mean so like like my wife might not like me
but my customer was happy that I fixed their printer you know what I mean so at
the end of the day like I got my fulfillment from my job and accomplishing these
things because I as a kid growing up you know like I barely graduated high school
so you know my family's like how did you become a business owner it's like I
did I have no clue and I can't tell I became an accidental entrepreneur I can't
tell a person how to do it and honestly if I had to start over again right now
after doing it two or three times I still don't know what to do I feel like you
know but I worked there I got fired all I knew how to do was fix printers and
help people and I've been doing that for the last 20 years but every time I
start doing that it generates revenue and then I need people and then it falls
apart man I don't manage them I don't manage the people properly because I'm too
busy in the business yeah and I and I want to start doing that because I
actually do like training people like I like going places where people don't
know how to do something and teaching them a better way to do it or see a way
that they're doing it like I have a clock lady right now I mean she's got a
legit clock business bro they sell custom clocks from seven inches 12
inches 15 like a pizza do all the up to 36 custom printed on wood and these
printers are expensive a hundred thousand dollars well they're they're they're
dilapidated one is in complete disarray and it needs like probably 20
thousand dollars with a work to get it to run again or she could buy that
printer over there for 10 grand get some nice material and change your
process so
