@Chris Andrade [0:09]: Forward the scene

@Chris Andrade [0:32]: Pretty good though. I mean getting rid of something's good. I sold my demos 2600 and sold that. It's latex right sorry.

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [0:36]: Good morning.

@Chris Andrade [0:40]: She had some sales. Good morning, good morning. Yeah, I mean stuff that I've been.

@Matthew Kerns [0:40]: Good morning

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [0:46]: How's it going

@Chris Andrade [0:48]: Morning fellas Good morning

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [0:50]: Hey

@Chris Andrade [0:53]: So we're here with Kelsey, we're a little Scattered right now, so just stand by while we're getting things situated where I so he's expressed a couple of times that He's having When he wakes up, we know his routine, right? He wakes up

@Chris Andrade [1:13]: And he likes to go into this hot tub. Here's Kelsey's back there. He's on his On his Tablet trying to figure out the day, but I The Like it's so I, I really don't have that much to do, but it's just not organized, and, like, I don't know, like, who's going where. We haven't finished things from last week.

@Chris Andrade [1:38]: And like I just don't, I got like 15 things on my plate, but really only 3 things I really got to do today. And the other ones I have to figure out how to I'm not good at it, man, like and a list is horrible at it, like she doesn't, she's got amnesia. She's one aspect of particularly? Organization or like

@Chris Andrade [1:56]: Without any kind of notes, they're constantly having to reference notes. She doesn't have like a very good Idea of what happened the day before. And one thing he said is like he has this invoice that he needs to get sent out. But he has to wait for Alyssa, right? And I, I can do it myself, but it just, it gets, if I don't let her be involved in it, and she doesn't know what happened, and then

@Chris Andrade [2:20]: Duplicating things and stuff. So like, I try and like wait for her for anything that needs to happen in regards to my day so that she can do it, not because I don't know how, but if I don't like communicate with her, then she doesn't understand what's happening.

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [2:34]: Yeah

@Chris Andrade [2:34]: It's like a constant like communication. Like I'm just trying, like I have so much anxiety right now, I can't even print your document you emailed me this morning. I I went to print over there and the printer's broken and I don't have the driver loaded for the other printer, so I'm emailing it over to here and I can't find his email because I've never sat here before. I found it. because this guy does my grinning for him, so hopefully he's got the driver there.

@Chris Andrade [3:00]: So, I just wanted, I, I need, I need this document because I understand how crucial it is that we get all these steps done and I need a listena to be here because she's going to help me today. Set up those accounts and then put the passwords in the system and stuff like that so we have access and all that otherwise, Nobody knows what's what. And so I have all my passwords saved in that capsulele program.

@Chris Andrade [3:19]: I'm gonna give you guys whatever access you want because I trust you and I don't know what to do with it anyways. but I'm not gonna just give you my whole access. You know what I mean like I'll just like whatever you need. I'll give you a, you know, but I'm not going to go into Jobber and create the accounts like Alyssa can do that really fast and it'll take me like 4 hours.

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [3:37]: Mhm

@Matthew Kerns [3:37]: Yeah

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [3:38]: This is the most efficient way for you guys, right? And we're, we're here to support you in any way that we can remotely, right? Chris is there physically and, you know, I, if we need to, I can send you a link and you can click on it or Alyssa can, and we can access the computer to click around to show you how to do it too. That's also an option, so.

@Chris Andrade [3:54]: Yeah, yeah, that's, yeah, whatever, if Chris can help out, whatever, like, I mean, we know, I know how to set up an account, but like I don't literally, like I would like to go in there and set it up and look at it and all this kind of thing, but I don't have time, man. Like I got people want me to do stuff and I gotta, I gotta keep pushing forward.

@Trent [3:56]: Yeah Mhm Yeah Mhm. Yeah, I know Yeah, and that's what we want. We want you to do it the most efficient way it is for you, and that's kind of why we wanted, it's, it's not absolutely critical that we get all this information immediately, but we do want to start getting it moving.

@Chris Andrade [4:20]: Yeah, but you get going. The most important thing is getting that ball rolling cause that's got to, I know it takes 5 to 30 days. I've dealt with that shit before, porting numbers and stuff is a pain.

@Trent [4:30]: Yeah, yeah. So one thing that I need to just confirm, not necessarily with you, but I need to confirm with somebody else that we should be able to start that process before we worry about moving your phone number from Vonage to quo.

@Chris Andrade [4:45]: Oh, OK.

@Trent [4:45]: As far as I can, as far as I understand, we have to sign up for quo, and then we have to start that process so that we have access to doing text messaging, but we don't have to move your number yet, so we can have that like prepared in quo, and then when it's time to move the number, it'll just be a switch. It'll just go tink, tink, and then it'll be all functional. That's the idea.

@Chris Andrade [5:06]: Can I, can I forward my cell phone there too, so it captures that information.

@Trent [5:12]: Probably we'll look at that. So, we'll look at how we can do that.

@Chris Andrade [5:13]: Because most Personal cell phone right now A lot. So if I were to forward that quote and then have it come back, at least it could record it if that's what the the goal is. A and before we get moving, let's like make sure we get everything situated first, so the Panda document, were you, were you able to pull that up on your tablet, Kelsey?

@Trent [5:19]: Yeah. Yeah.

@Chris Andrade [5:36]: OK. Cause we wanna get, should we, we wanna go that route, right? Make sure let's get the, all the contract stuff figured out real quick and just make sure everything's on that

@Trent [5:47]: Yeah Yeah, if we can, if there's any issues with that, let's try to address that, you know, maybe.

@Chris Andrade [5:52]: Yeah.

@Trent [5:53]: I wanna say first thing, but I know.

@Chris Andrade [5:55]: Yeah Yeah, he, sorry, I wasn't, I was not prepared today, really. My, I didn't realize what we got going on. I got a houseboat that I've had for like the last 15 years and my wife and my sister-in-law and brother-in-law, I'm not working on that shit, dude. Like I got so much going on over here. Like I have abandoned the boat. Like I would rather sink it, but she wants to fix it. So they're up there doing I hired my buddy electrician. He went up there and wired it because I'm not going to have a fire hazard, but

@Trent [6:15]: Yeah Yeah, but what we're here to, you know, work with you. So it's whatever you need to do, man.

@Chris Andrade [6:24]: They're doing that, but I really want my sister-in-law And my, to, to be part of this as we move forward once we get going, but I'm the one that's going to make the ball roll, like, and, and get it going because it's the most important thing to me.

@Trent [6:31]: Yeah. Yeah, yeah

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [6:37]: Yeah

@Chris Andrade [6:38]: So I, I'm, I've just printed one of these documents that, well, I did. I heard it go off back here somewhere. You got like fucking 10,000 printers in here, bro. I don't.

@Trent [6:48]: He's, he's a.

@Chris Andrade [6:49]: What's this? What's on a computer, you need Joe to come and pray. Oh yeah, OK, and let me see I feel like he's a little flustered.

@Trent [7:00]: Yeah, I mean, if if we need to, you know, pause for 15 or 30 minutes or something, it's fine. We don't have this.

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [7:03]: Yeah, I be like

@Chris Andrade [7:07]: Yeah, and, and I would like to, I just wanna see if we can look at the pinna doc. Let me just try to see if I can get him there and we'll talk that out, let me see, he's coming back right now and see. Oh, cool, she.

@Trent [7:19]: The

@Chris Andrade [7:21]: Awesome.

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [7:21]: If if us

@Trent [7:23]: So good

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [7:24]: No, go on, I was just gonna say.

@Trent [7:26]: I was just gonna say the first section of the Panda Doc is all standard jargon.

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [7:27]: Yeah.

@Trent [7:32]: And then the end of it, the, the last, like, page or so is the important part. What?

@Chris Andrade [7:35]: Trust, right? We sent that to him on Friday.

@Trent [7:40]: Yeah, yeah

@Chris Andrade [7:41]: OK. Hey, good morning.

@Trent [7:44]: It should say like from Trance, but it's probably an at pandadoc email though.

@Chris Andrade [7:50]: OK. Do you think it's in my junk folder?

@Trent [7:52]: It might be. It's, it's possible it can hit the junk folder.

@Chris Andrade [7:53]: Yeah

@Trent [7:58]: If you just search Pandaoc, P A N D A D O C. Hopefully you'll find it

@Chris Andrade [8:04]: I wish I knew how to use Outlook. And what? I just said pizza. And yep, there it is. So we're gonna hit open, so it saves it to Alyssa because I can. Is this the doctor's

@Chris Andrade [8:23]: Yes, that's the one that could be conclusive. Like I haven't used the computer in like a year, man. I'm just getting back into a computer this year. I, I abandoned my computer all last year. We got reps. So now when I sit down in front of one, I feel like a handicapped person unless I'm going like a driver or something. I know what to do because they keep changing the interface. I sat down in front of QuickBooks the other day. I didn't even recognize it dude

@Chris Andrade [8:50]: Oh.

@Trent [8:50]: Revamp

@Chris Andrade [8:51]: They did do a total revamp. I saw that. I saw that. So, are you gonna print this for me? Yeah, are you able to pull up the pen that email on here? I can because, because the way the panadoc works is that it's a digital contract and then you can sign it digitally in the junk folder yeah.

@Trent [9:12]: It, it makes it pretty easy as long as you, if you can pull it up.

@Chris Andrade [9:16]: Do you see it? so we'll go here, we're gonna hit Pina, says typing. I didn't realize you could just search things like that. Yeah, yeah, buddy, it's your best friend. Oh. Panda mail. All this doesn't see it or what? I don't know, is this, is this no count on this this is that sweet Microsoft mail app, I think, is it Outlook, yeah.

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [9:37]: OK

@Chris Andrade [9:42]: There we go. This is the junk folder. So this my junk folder? Oh, I see which is that Kelsey? Yeah, there you go. So then. So then, let's do this. So maybe it's actually my inboss. Yeah, that's what I was gonna say. You need staples

@Chris Andrade [9:59]: I be sure. OK. Sorry guys, I feel like an asshole. Those.

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [10:04]: No worries

@Chris Andrade [10:06]: You look us, bro, this is your house.

@Trent [10:06]: No worries at all.

@Chris Andrade [10:10]: Hey

@Trent [10:10]: Yeah, exactly

@Chris Andrade [10:15]: Progress. There you go There we go. Open document. OK. All right. Looks like we got OK Do we wanna walk him through it or, or do you want to take a minute and look at this, what's your thoughts here, buddy?

@Trent [10:34]: It's Really up to what he feels comfortable with. Like when Kelsey feels comfortable with, because I

@Chris Andrade [10:37]: Well, just see some me, tell me what this is. I'm, I'm not, I, I need help reading documents. So that's why I'm usually so start at the top here. Do you wanna share your screen?

@Trent [10:42]: OK. Sure

@Chris Andrade [10:47]: Do you have yours open

@Trent [10:49]: I can't. I don't have it open immediately, but I can. So, generally

@Chris Andrade [10:52]: Yeah, I'll, I'll walk through it. Go ahead.

@Trent [10:55]: OK good good

@Chris Andrade [10:57]: I was like

@Trent [10:57]: I was just gonna say that

@Chris Andrade [11:00]: Go ahead, you got

@Trent [11:00]: And we got this delay here.

@Chris Andrade [11:02]: I know, huh

@Trent [11:03]: It's killing us on the delay. yeah, let me pull up the, the, I don't know if I need to, but I'm going to, Stay here.

@Chris Andrade [11:13]: He's he's just going in services, saying that our exhibit state of work SOW. The SOW specifies deliverables, timeline, and acceptance of criteria, any services beyond definition of SOW is required and and what's SOW? Is that this? So no, it's just statement of work. What is that? Well, the Iran.

@Trent [11:34]: So Yeah, so at the beginning of this document, it's all like standard jargon, like you might have in any other document, really it's just saying it's trying to protect you and it's trying to protect us, you know, that we're going to deliver a service for you, and, you're gonna, you're gonna engage with us so that we can help deliver the service and you're gonna make payment to us, right? So that's kind of what the, the very beginning says

@Chris Andrade [11:47]: Mhm.

@Trent [11:56]: But the SOW SOW is the statement of work. That's the document that we work for from. To make sure that we deliver to you. So, we're on the hook.

@Chris Andrade [12:07]: And is that, you have any time yet? Are we already created? That's that's, that's in here. Yeah, that's in here.

@Trent [12:10]: Say again Yep, yep, you scroll, you scroll further, it's, it's further beyond, it's attached to it, and the statement of work is what defines the details of what we're going to give you.

@Chris Andrade [12:22]: And can we touch on the intellectual property stuff just to clear them up on that.

@Trent [12:27]: Yes, so you get access to anything we create you to use it to however you want to, the only limitation is that we retain rights of the to sell it. It's kind of really the way that it works in this instance. So like if you were to take our process procedures and basically take everything we're doing for you right now and package it up and sell it exactly like we're we're doing. That's the only thing it really protects us from, but otherwise, everything else is yours.

@Chris Andrade [12:53]: OK Cause I can't even figure out how to do it myself, so.

@Trent [12:59]: But it also says that not just intellectual property, but also just, it's a mutual, non-disclosure. So if there's something about your business or something about our business that we don't want to

@Chris Andrade [13:00]: So And I

@Trent [13:13]: Say again

@Chris Andrade [13:13]: I know anything about this, you know all of it in what you're trying to protect is that I don't take what you're teaching me and then use it against you or for vice versa. We take, and we can't take your intellectual property like, let's say you have this one special way or how you service as one machine.

@Trent [13:21]: Bingo

@Chris Andrade [13:33]: If we have the information, we protect it and it will be if I'm doing something that great guys, let's bottle it up and sell it together, dude.

@Trent [13:33]: Yeah Well, that's, that's the goal right there. You are, you are.

@Chris Andrade [13:44]: Exactly I want to go over number 6 real quick. Client responsibilities. Yes, this is me. I want to hear this part. I want to hear what I'm responsible for because I don't wanna, I don't wanna drop the ball and make it be my fault, dude. So we're just being there a second and let you all say it out loud. The client agrees provided timely access to systems, personnel, information necessary for us, the contractors, to perform the services that's too late to the SOD. So listen, what, what, what that means is that I'm just gonna need your help fulfill

@Chris Andrade [14:17]: Ing this. I gotta create some accounts, and I'll work with you. I'm not, we're not trying to like overwhelm or anything, no, no, but we've got to create a phone system, we got to create a new account for a new phone system because we're going to port our old one over to this new one so the AI thing can track it and it's going to be basically a new phone system. So I just need your help, your help going through and helping me check all these boxes and get all this information together later on.

@Chris Andrade [14:39]: OK. We'll go over it with Chris, and we're here like, but we just got to make sure that we're not slowing them down from proceeding with what they need to do.

@Trent [14:47]: Yeah, and ultimately, and ultimately what it says in there, if for any reason you do cause delay, cause it can happen, right? Is that it just might push our schedule back.

@Chris Andrade [14:54]: Yeah Yeah. So we're promising you SOW in 4 weeks, but if something happens, then you, you kind of, it gives us some like justification like, well, yeah, no, no, I understand.

@Trent [14:59]: So Yep, yep

@Chris Andrade [15:12]: And, and same thing, just technical, you know, we're independent contractors, general pro you guys are a company, I'm just the company. So, the SOW part, where is that at, Mr. Trent I'm see.

@Trent [15:25]: That's it. You, you were reading it. It was at exhibit A.

@Chris Andrade [15:29]: At exhibit A different.

@Trent [15:32]: It's page Page 4 Is the beginning of statement of work.

@Chris Andrade [15:37]: Because Maybe you have to sign before you can move to the next step or what? Exhibit A. Oh there we go. So he got go down far enough. That's what it was. So the project overview

@Trent [15:45]: Well, you can You

@Chris Andrade [15:51]: Contractor will implement a communication control system that makes Jabber the single source of truth for the client's operations. This includes documented workflows, SOPs, supporting the QO and Jabber integration and training to ensure team adoption. Success means the team has clear protocols for daily

@Chris Andrade [16:15]: Daily operations have to have this dude and unified communications. I know, cause, cause I don't want you waking up and your mornings being like this anymore. And then

@Trent [16:24]: Yeah, we're gonna fix that

@Chris Andrade [16:26]: Yeah, deliverables, so the contractor will provide the following deliverables. We're supporting SOPs for the QO. So we're going to show you guys how to use it and the Jaber integration, right? how all that works. Documented workflows with step by step instructions and decision flow charts for key operational process, right? Then the communication protocol guide is a one-page rulebook for the team communication standard, what I was talking about, like a perfect. We're training

@Chris Andrade [16:56]: Videos, short video walkthroughs for each core workflow. So we're, we're not only gonna tell you, but we're also going to create a video that you can, you're like, oh fuck, what did they say? Here, let me just hit play and then you can actually follow the steps like that. Live training sessions, we, we can provide, we're performing some training, new workflows and systems. We do live

@Chris Andrade [17:17]: We're like Trend said earlier, we're always here for support, and then your blew up the plotter ops blueprint, a visual roadmap showing current phase and future optimization opportunities. So once this first iteration is done, then we can tell you, hey, I, we can do this next, right? Is that safe to say, guys?

@Trent [17:36]: Yeah. Precisely Yup, yep

@Chris Andrade [17:37]: Yeah Like the website or some other whatever you said whatever, whatever you think, oh man, we probably should shift gears wherever you decide that go. Yeah, yeah, once we get the the back end stuff, so, these are, the timelines, so week one, shadow sessions to validate workflows, configure iterations, week two handoff template goes live, integration testing, so now we're starting to test the the jobber thing or?

@Trent [17:49]: Yep

@Chris Andrade [18:05]: Whatever the integration is.

@Trent [18:05]: Yeah, we'll be testing what we, yeah, the things that we plan on doing, right, with quo and Joer, we'll be doing some testing on that to make sure that it functions properly. Currently, Matthew already is doing some testing with his own trial account. Now, so we're, we're developing it now even though we haven't actually gotten, you know, the project from you yet. We're still already working ahead, so.

@Chris Andrade [18:25]: Yeah, so. So technically our contract doesn't start till when.

@Trent [18:32]: The 5th of January.

@Chris Andrade [18:34]: So we're, we're, we're just getting a head start on this. So I mean it's the holidays and stuff too, yeah, yeah, and then so The client's responsibility, so like part, so admin access to jobber which we are working on right now. Yeah, Alyssa can set that up quickly. Yep, I don't know if we have your email address. We'll, we'll set all, we'll get, I'll get that. we're making key team members available for Shadow sessions like we're doing right now. So you're already checking that box, week one and live training week 3 and 4.

@Chris Andrade [19:07]: So we'll have to schedule how long do you think training's gonna take in on around January, what we're talking 20th

@Trent [19:18]: Yeah, roughly late January, right? So, I mean, right now it's saying approximately 3 to 4 hours is kind of what we can do that, we don't have to do it, we don't have to do it in one session. We can do it in multiple sessions, right? So.

@Chris Andrade [19:23]: In that Maybe like we do Either an hour increments or 30 minute increments or something, we'll figure it out. We'll show you how that works. We'll just I wanna schedule thing where we can may probably be towards the end of the day, or is that when you guys are usually slow slower? Yeah, usually. OK. And then,

@Trent [19:34]: Yeah. Yeah Yeah, yeah. Yeah, you know, when it comes time.

@Chris Andrade [19:47]: Yup, so it'd be better to do that in the afternoon, I think, and then in the mornings. So this way we shouldn't have an issue here. We're just saying it, we're, we, if we have a question that we send you, we kind of just need a response within 48 hours. If you need to get a hold of me, just text me if it's real important. I got you. I, I know where you live, bro. I know where you live. Commit to using the

@Chris Andrade [20:05]: For at least 3, yeah, before requesting change, so if there's like something that were the so in this set of deliverers, so we need to make sure we're clear here, right? This is where we have to stick to. We're building you this, right? If you decide, damn, I want to change it now, right? That's where this rule comes in, go ahead. Yeah, no.

@Trent [20:06]: Yeah, knock on your door.

@Trent [20:25]: And And yeah, and, and We'll build some clarity around that real quick, is that If we're building you something, if it doesn't work that you need the way you need for the workflow we're building, right? Then we can make adjustments to it, but if you say, oh, you know what, we need to go a completely different route. We need to add all this and this and this and this and this. That's the only thing that we're really saying, you know,

@Trent [20:51]: If it's an issue or if it's, it doesn't quite work and we need to tweak it a little bit, it's fine. It's just one a statement in this document is just basically saying, hey,

@Chris Andrade [21:00]: OK. I'm not bad about that too. Like I'm like a, I'm like a squirrel, and I'll be like.

@Trent [21:02]: You could Yeah Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, so it

@Chris Andrade [21:09]: This is to keep that from happening. Like we got no, I, I, I agree. I mean, I, I'm trying to be upfront with you guys as possible right now so we don't get to the point where we're doing that later on. Yeah, exactly.

@Trent [21:09]: Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah. And, and we are too. We're trying to be as as forward and as transparent about everything as we can, so.

@Chris Andrade [21:23]: Yeah, yeah, I could tell. Appreciate it. I mean, I'm excited to try something, man, like I, I feel so much more, I mean, this looks kind of like overwhelmingly expensive to be honest with you, as I sit here looking at all of the 5 of you guys sitting over here, but I mean, I've, I, I, I took this business to where I'm at, and I cannot get it any further, man. I'm, I'm done. Like, it took me like 2 years to get it to where I'm at, and I'm just like stagnant there and just getting like

@Trent [21:24]: Yeah.

@Trent [21:42]: Oh Cool Yeah

@Chris Andrade [21:49]: Stuff

@Trent [21:49]: We're gonna, we're gonna get you. We're gonna, we're gonna free you of all of that nonsense.

@Chris Andrade [21:51]: You're not, I can't wait. I can't wait till the guy where this morning where he when I did my testimony for your guys' website and then you wake up and you fuzzy and you're like damn, I don't have to be at the office till like 10, cause everything's already handled, OK. Yeah, yeah, yeah, just straight up. Look at his face. Look at his face. He's like so giddy right now because I'm, I think you're joking me. No, I'm telling you, bro, it's gonna be awesome. Yeah, so.

@Trent [22:14]: It's our goal, man. That's our goal.

@Chris Andrade [22:17]: So, number 5 is saying that third party tools and services, so the project may involve the following third party tools. The client is responsible for all associated subscription costs and agrees that the contractor is not allowed or liable for changes, outages, or discontinued of these services. So that's a good thing to put in your thing. Yeah. So Qo right now, break that down for me. $69 a month.

@Trent [22:17]: Yeah

@Chris Andrade [22:42]: You got to buy it for the whole year upfront or what? Is that what they want you to do

@Trent [22:45]: I think to get it to get a discount, you buy it annually, but you can do it just monthly if you don't care to, if you don't want to take the risk of buying it annually, they want to charge you more per month.

@Chris Andrade [22:55]: Yeah, of course. I mean, we can just start with the monthly thing until we get it rolling, and I can commit to the gear. I mean, I, I, once I swi I don't like Vonage, so switching from it's not a problem for me and I don't think it costs any much more than what I'm. How much do you pay for bondage fucking know, around that, OK, OK, yeah, so I don't have any services. I don't even have voicemail, dude, so I'm not paying much. It's like I, I mean, yeah, if that's what you want to do, pay monthly, obviously giving you a pretty good. We'll set it up monthly right now. OK. And then, NAN, so

@Trent [22:59]: Got it. Yeah, that's

@Chris Andrade [23:25]: The contractor con configure as needed, so this is like, go on, explain on the NAN real quick.

@Trent [23:33]: So you talked about Zapier or Zapier, however you want to say it. Yeah, it's NAN is just another zapier, but it's got more power. It's a little bit more developer focused. So for us, so for us it's a little bit, it's got more features for, for us to be able to give you a better outcome.

@Chris Andrade [23:37]: Yeah. There you go I can't do that here I totally fine switching to whatever that shit is you're talking about. I'm

@Trent [23:53]: Yeah, yeah. We got you. We just need to make sure we put it in there to make you aware of it. That's all.

@Chris Andrade [23:58]: No, I agree that, that there's something better and especially if you guys know how to use it. Like that's even and I'm not going to go in there and like, oh, I'm going to tweak this this weekend because I got nothing better to do and make it better like.

@Trent [24:02]: Yeah Yeah. The, the goal is not the goal is to give you ownership of it, but we're the ones that are actually going to create the solution for you. So,

@Chris Andrade [24:15]: OK Your breath. Yeah, I don't wanna touch it. I don't even want to log into it if I don't have to.

@Trent [24:18]: Yeah.

@Chris Andrade [24:22]: So I don't want

@Trent [24:23]: That's the goal

@Chris Andrade [24:24]: I don't want no one else messing it up. Like you guys are gonna be the only ones getting in there.

@Trent [24:27]: We're We're trying to get you actually further away from those systems. We're trying to get you a little bit further away from having to check email all the time, having to check your messages all the time. We're trying to disconnect that so you can focus on what you like to do.

@Chris Andrade [24:39]: That's It's too much of it, man. It's like all over and I, and I just like, I get like, I, I disoriented man.

@Trent [24:42]: Yeah. Yeah Yeah. Unfortunately, we have to add some technology so they can wire things up, so that we can get you a little further away from the technology. That's

@Chris Andrade [24:53]: No, I understand and, and I think there's a cost associated with it, you know, like I can justify it by sitting here and like looking at how many people it would take to do a certain thing or whatever like in in like

@Trent [24:55]: Yeah yeah

@Chris Andrade [25:06]: Yeah, so I mean, I'm, I understand like things are different now than they used to be. Like, you have to, this is just the way it is, man. You just.

@Trent [25:12]: And it's rapidly improving. Right now, it's rapidly improving. So it

@Chris Andrade [25:16]: The the the whole.

@Trent [25:18]: Yeah.

@Chris Andrade [25:19]: The whole Like, cause to me, like, ever since I heard this, it's just gotten further apart, dude. Did they said that like people who like how many thousands of dollars were wasted in using ARI integrations when it first came out, and now they're like rendered useless, right?

@Trent [25:21]: I think. It is

@Chris Andrade [25:35]: Because of how fast

@Trent [25:35]: Well, yeah, there's a lot of, yeah, there's a lot of companies that tried to adopt, like I think they're saying like 80% of projects are failing, for AI, but that's based on some reports that somebody magically created out of their butt, but regardless

@Chris Andrade [25:43]: Yeah No, I can

@Trent [25:52]: Yeah, typically the reason that happened is because they tried to take on their projects themselves instead of using a partner that knows how to implement it, so that's largely why they fail.

@Chris Andrade [26:03]: Yeah, for sure

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [26:03]: Part of that study was talking about enterprises too, and just how like enterprises took longer to adopt versus small businesses being able to pivot quicker and kind of like manage for small businesses, they're able to pivot quicker to adopt technology to integrate and bring in these services and tools that they have permits, like I.

@Trent [26:11]: Yeah. Yes Yup And that, and that's why we are helping the small to medium business owners because they are at an advantage over the enterprises because they can pivot, you can add technology, you can change quickly, so.

@Chris Andrade [26:32]: Yeah, yeah

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [26:32]: There's too much, there's just too much politics and and.

@Trent [26:35]: Yeah

@Chris Andrade [26:37]: So this is what's due today, OK, We can, if you can do a check, and then I can just, I can go to take it straight to the bank if you're cool with that. And then if you're all good with, I mean, is there any clarities, anything that you question or concern? No, I'm, I'm willing to, to, to, to step into this for $5000 and see what you guys can put together, man, I'm, I'm down. So then, you, I want you to push that button.

@Chris Andrade [27:02]: I just Looking at

@Trent [27:09]: Yeah, we're excited to get it started for you, man. We really are, so.

@Chris Andrade [27:12]: Water mechanics. There it is. My actual company is called Mighty Pigs. You guys are asking me for my VIN numbers and all my, my, all my numbers or whatever. My LLC is called Mighty Picks and plotter Mechanics is a DBA.

@Trent [27:26]: Yeah. Got it. Got it.

@Chris Andrade [27:31]: So, yeah, I think, plotter Incs is also a DBA.

@Trent [27:36]: Mhm.

@Chris Andrade [27:36]: On Google Maps down the road. It said powder inks or plotter mechanics when I was coming up because I forgot what sheet at the mailbox. No, on Google Maps I had said, Hey, plotter mechanics, and then plotter Incs and plotter mechanics. So it's like, is that a competitor? No, that's my, I don't know. I don't know who set up my dude. I lost 55 5-star reviews to Google, dude, and I after that I just gave up on the whole thing. Like I don't even know where my Google account sits or what the password or who created the last one. I don't know shit about any of it, man. I, I don't know. What's the address?

@Chris Andrade [28:06]: You need the address of the of you guys need my And I have a mailbox. So this is my physical address, but my mightyix's address is at the mailbox by Walmart. So I'm going to put that on my documents.

@Trent [28:17]: Yeah, whatever, whatever your, entity address is, is fine.

@Chris Andrade [28:20]: I'm just, do you want me to sign it says plotter mechanics or Mighty Pigs? Well, this is the plotter mechanics.

@Trent [28:26]: Doesn't matter

@Chris Andrade [28:27]: That's fine. Yeah Let me get the address

@Trent [28:29]: It doesn't matter as long as it's tied back to your entity, that's all. So your your LLC, you can use the DBA, you can use LLC, whatever you want.

@Chris Andrade [28:33]: Yeah, yeah, yeah That's IPXLC, the address is 7800 North North, Fifty-fifth Avenue. Suite 102 - 225

@Trent [28:49]: Something Something kind of fun as I can see you typing it over on my side. Like it's, the text is showing up on the document as you type it.

@Chris Andrade [28:58]: 000 shit. I was like, are you getting? I don't know if you love it.vie 85301. OK. Then hidden, there you go

@Chris Andrade [29:15]: Or Come on next Oh That looks it

@Chris Andrade [29:42]: Sting.

@Trent [29:42]: And then I think there's just the initials and the date at the bottom.

@Chris Andrade [29:48]: Woo! That's great. All right. Hi.

@Trent [29:48]: About them Completed Signed Woohoo Where's the, where's the reaction Button? Is there like a confetti?

@Chris Andrade [29:58]: All that Mhm

@Trent [30:01]: Any confetti That Confetti. There it is

@Chris Andrade [30:07]: Yeah

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [30:07]: Nice

@Chris Andrade [30:10]: OK, so we got the first check one done. And what is, what are we doing on for check 2? What's our what's our Biggest thing that we need to get done right now?

@Trent [30:22]: I think there's some information about the Like the EIN and there's information we need to get the phone number process, working.

@Chris Andrade [30:31]: This is on this list that's on this document right here, right? I think I

@Trent [30:35]: Yeah, we, we moved forward to that, yeah, so really, I mean, we can do it in almost in any order. It doesn't really matter. The order as much as it does that we kind of do all the things. So I think right now there's just some information at the top that needs to be collected, yeah.

@Chris Andrade [30:36]: Agree. Like You want me just to edit this document and just put it in this document and give it back to you, or?

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [30:54]: You can always scan it.

@Trent [30:55]: That, yeah, that's up to you if you want

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [30:57]: You just take care of

@Trent [30:57]: Yeah, if you want to scan it in that way, you can do that. You can either do it that way or if you want to, you know, Chris can take note of it and send it to us or

@Chris Andrade [31:06]: The dress all this. I'll make sure that before I leave here that Chris and Alyssa have a clear Understanding of what they done here. So in order to get Qo set up, we got to get what do you need me to do right now that's going to help you guys?

@Trent [31:13]: Yeah.

@Chris Andrade [31:21]: Like what's the most important thing I can do to help you guys do what you need to do.

@Trent [31:23]: If

@Chris Andrade [31:25]: Access to what? Like does that, like what's the first?

@Trent [31:28]: Access to access to jobber and setting up a QO A QO account, which I think is gonna require your entity information. So like the, the EIN information and all that crap, so.

@Chris Andrade [31:38]: Yeah Yeah, OK, so let's, here, I'm gonna start doing that right here Where is, where would be your, where would be that information. For the your EIN and, oh, that's right.

@Trent [31:54]: Are you And we can do, we can do this in multiple ways. Either you guys can work on it together, or it

@Chris Andrade [32:00]: Yeah, we'll work on it. You guys don't need to waste your time sitting here when we fill these forms. I, I don't think so do I want to go to QO and register Kelsey through QO right now?

@Trent [32:09]: You're, sure, that would be one of the easier ways to do it.

@Chris Andrade [32:13]: Yeah. Let me just do that. Let me walk him through getting registered with QO and get all the paperwork going on that so that they can do that and then what do I need to name them? Hey, do you guys want 3 separate job or accounts or do you just need one?

@Trent [32:29]: I think just one is fine, don't you think, Matthew? What do you think?

@Matthew Kerns [32:32]: I think we need probably 3 invites to Jouber.

@Chris Andrade [32:37]: OK. Yeah, we just need your 3 email addresses.

@Matthew Kerns [32:37]: I OK

@Trent [32:42]: Oh yeah, I don't think we have that in the docks.

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [32:45]: Right

@Chris Andrade [32:46]: I was thinking, what, what's your, Alyssa's email is Alyssa, A L Y S S A at plotter mechanics.com. We have several unused email addresses and You know, they could use those. Yeah, that's fine. They're all just make them admin accounts. We have, we have a bunch of arts created like there's one called Ser. Do you, did you want to be separate from the ones we're using?

@Matthew Kerns [33:07]: I think we need you to invite our email address so that we can

@Chris Andrade [33:12]: OK Yeah, I agree

@Matthew Kerns [33:13]: You

@Chris Andrade [33:14]: Yeah, just send an email to Alyssa with your emails that you want and She'll create the job or accounts right away and we'll get that out of the way.

@Matthew Kerns [33:22]: OK, and it was a list

@Trent [33:22]: And you said that was A L Y S S A at plotter mechanics.

@Chris Andrade [33:27]: Yeah, with the X Email code, email, email.

@Trent [33:45]: Yeah, if you want, I can just take these Emails and copy and send them to.

@Chris Andrade [33:50]: And you wanna be?

@Trent [33:51]: Or

@Matthew Kerns [33:54]: Is it these emails I just put in the huddle, the slack cutter chat.

@Trent [33:56]: Yeah.

@Matthew Kerns [33:58]: OK.

@Trent [33:58]: Yeah, I just put Alyssa's email in there too. So we've got a list of the email plus all the emails you just put in. So

@Chris Andrade [34:05]: Yeah, and then like I kind of need your advice too, like I have a bunch of email addresses like I have service, supplies. Accounting, all these different things like is it better to just have one? Point of communication

@Trent [34:19]: No, I'm, I, I think, I mean, I, there are reasons you might want to create those aliases. You may not need them to go to different inboxes. So if it becomes unwieldy to manage a bunch of like, OK, this email goes here and this email goes here and there's another inbox here that can be challenging to maintain.

@Chris Andrade [34:37]: You know I'm trying to keep it to where only customers email those email addresses, you know, like if a customer sends an email to supplies, then we could take that information and do something with it, but we're not emailing each other through those accounts anymore. Like if we need to talk to each other, we email each other and then those are just for basically the customer's communication, but my goal is to, as soon as it comes in there, get it into Joer and delete that out of the inbox so I don't get confused and be looking at stuff that's already been started, you know.

@Trent [34:44]: Yeah. Right

@Trent [35:01]: Mhm. Yep, exactly. I think, you know, having one like general email is a good idea.

@Chris Andrade [35:06]: Because

@Trent [35:11]: But you, you probably don't need much more than that. So like a support.

@Chris Andrade [35:17]: Yeah, I'm just asking for your advice because I own, I don't own it currently, but I'm getting ready to, my, my IT guy is going to give me his exchange account and let me take it over. That's how I got Vonage too. He retired, so I'm just waiting for somebody. Can you guys help me manage that?

@Matthew Kerns [35:33]: Yeah, right

@Chris Andrade [35:33]: The The Outlook cause he's ready to turn it over to me, but I'm like, I had another guy that was going to help me and I was like, dude, But I don't want to turn it over unless I trust the person I give it to because I don't, you know, like, to help me do it, like he's ready to give it to me, but I don't want it like it's the same thing like I don't want to do anything with it. Like I called Jim. I'm like, hey, can you create this ruler? Hey, can you do something for me? I don't, I don't go in there at all. I don't really want to

@Matthew Kerns [35:52]: Yeah Yeah You want all the stuff in Jobber, so any anyway it comes in, I think is what we, we should be working on. So if it comes in through email, if it comes in through your phone call, that's why we're doing quo. Then we should be able to get all that stuff streamlined for you.

@Chris Andrade [36:08]: Yeah Yeah.

@Trent [36:12]: Yeah, so Matthew, were you sending an email or am I sending it? To a lesson

@Matthew Kerns [36:16]: I wasn't sending it

@Trent [36:18]: OK

@Matthew Kerns [36:19]: OK, could you send it?

@Trent [36:19]: I just wanna make sure we're not gonna send her a bunch of emails from different people, right? So,

@Chris Andrade [36:23]: Yeah.

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [36:24]: OK

@Chris Andrade [36:25]: Well, she'll do the jobber thing real quick and then we'll get the quote set up. I mean, those two things are crucial. What's next I need to do besides give you guys all my information. And I'll work on the IT thing with my IT guy on getting him to transfer it over to me so I have the username and information that I can share that with you guys too. Hey Matthew, you were talking about something about you were wanting to get

@Trent [36:44]: OK.

@Chris Andrade [36:48]: Access to the, like you've mentioned something about you have a bunch of old videos. Like from like back in the day or like I I I got videos in my phone. I'm in my, in my cloud library I can go through and what cloud, what cloud library are you referring to? Oh, so your personal iPad? Uh-huh.

@Chris Andrade [37:06]: I mean, all my pictures, you got like

@Matthew Kerns [37:06]: Yes.

@Chris Andrade [37:08]: Bless you. Yeah, yeah.

@Matthew Kerns [37:09]: So So email access and then would, would definitely help us get started. but then also the

@Chris Andrade [37:10]: I I need to like.

@Matthew Kerns [37:19]: Then also, yeah, those, those training videos, cause what we're trying to do is we're trying to set up SOPs based on all the communications and everything you're doing, but if you've already created videos that have like the SOP in a training video, that's gonna be one of the quickest ways we can like

@Matthew Kerns [37:37]: Get everything together in a training that employees can just pick up and just You know, look at instead of coming to you.

@Chris Andrade [37:45]: Yeah, yeah. I'm gonna have to start making videos. I've been talking to Chris about trying to figure out what the best way is to do it, you know, like I, I think like getting like the little camera I can clip on here or something that's super easy with the record button is gonna be the best bet for me cause I can't, I don't have time to set up all kinds of craziness.

@Matthew Kerns [38:01]: Yeah, that makes sense.

@Chris Andrade [38:04]: For now anyways, I, I, I, I don't know what the best way is, but I'm gonna, I'm, I'm working on trying to figure it out, get that going.

@Matthew Kerns [38:08]: Yeah. I think easy, easy recording of stuff like with the attached microphone is good, great to start, and then over time we'll, we'll help you start to identify, OK, like what are the things that need to get videos created for.

@Chris Andrade [38:25]: OK. Yeah, yeah, that'd be cool. And I can make a, make videos as I go out on my days basically.

@Matthew Kerns [38:31]: Yeah, like once you know there's a high leverage video to be created, then created.

@Chris Andrade [38:37]: I can, I mean, I probably know what a lot of those are because I'm dealing with this shit every day, you know, so.

@Matthew Kerns [38:41]: Yeah. Yeah

@Chris Andrade [38:43]: There's certain things that would definitely

@Matthew Kerns [38:43]: Definitely.

@Chris Andrade [38:47]: Be subjects that would attract people wanting and drive them to a place, you know, like, Especially like on the and stuff, like the compatible inks, like I know how to fix the print heads and do all kinds of other stuff too. I can make videos about that stuff.

@Matthew Kerns [38:54]: Yeah Yeah, we, we need your input there cause we're not gonna know like, like we can try and help, but we're not gonna know the the business domain stuff like the printer, plotter mechanic stuff.

@Chris Andrade [39:12]: Yeah, yeah, yeah Yes, for sure OK. Email access

@Trent [39:17]: OK, so I just Yeah, I sent an email over to Alyssa's email.

@Chris Andrade [39:21]: OK you type in your,

@Trent [39:22]: So

@Chris Andrade [39:25]: Chelsea at Bo Mechanics, you know. With the password? Yeah Let me see.

@Matthew Kerns [39:33]: And, could you, did, did I get a copy of that email? I'm just wondering if

@Trent [39:39]: You should be a

@Matthew Kerns [39:39]: Oh Cool.

@Chris Andrade [39:41]: Why it's not working on the.

@Trent [39:42]: I, ICC'd all of us.

@Chris Andrade [39:44]: That the

@Matthew Kerns [39:46]: Yeah OK There's some instructions that Claude gave me, but I'm not entirely sure about these, like, Claude doesn't always know the settings menus. Even though it gives you a general idea

@Trent [40:01]: Yeah

@Chris Andrade [40:02]: I got a

@Trent [40:02]: Yeah, there is a good chance that we'll have to guide them through it, because the instructions may not be 100% accurate, right

@Matthew Kerns [40:12]: Yeah, so I got I got the jobber integration sort of working with my test developer account, so I can create a client

@Chris Andrade [40:25]: Is there

@Matthew Kerns [40:26]: A test client, and I can receive, so I can list them out, so I think

@Chris Andrade [40:31]: I

@Matthew Kerns [40:31]: Now we can sort of get credentials or somehow connect to their job or stuff, but we wanna just do the reading.

@Chris Andrade [40:39]: Yeah

@Trent [40:40]: Just, just reading, just test some reading, but not manipulating anything, yeah.

@Matthew Kerns [40:46]: Yeah

@Trent [40:47]: Yeah.

@Chris Andrade [40:47]: Oh

@Matthew Kerns [40:48]: And I have a developer account that has like client ID and secret key, and that's, but that's all I needed. Like I didn't need to create a separate Account for like the real jober one, so I'm not, I'm kind of unclear

@Matthew Kerns [41:04]: If I need to

@Chris Andrade [41:07]: I don't know

@Matthew Kerns [41:07]: Like how that connection is actually gonna look too, but

@Chris Andrade [41:08]: I, I use Spider mechanic, but I have the password. It's Toyota Tundra at 2025 is my password, but it didn't work. I tried to put it in there and doesn't accept it.

@Trent [41:18]: Heck yeah, you a thunder guy

@Chris Andrade [41:21]: So what kind of guy? Oh yeah, Toyota guy.

@Trent [41:23]: Yeah, I used to, yeah, I used to have a, a Tacoma. That thing was solid. Man, I missed that truck.

@Chris Andrade [41:29]: My neighbor's got a Tacoma up at the lake and he's got a whole like cook box in the back. He was telling me he gets 8 miles to the gallon. I was like, 8, I go, damn, that's, and then I looked in his truck, he's got his whole kitchen in the back of it and then he's got a big fat on the roof and big flat tires, dude, he said he gets like 8 to 10. So my son.

@Trent [41:38]: Well Yeah Yeah. Yeah, go ahead

@Chris Andrade [41:49]: I say my son, he just turned 16 His first vehicle that he could only drive if he could drive my 005 Tacoma 6 speed.

@Trent [41:53]: Mhm Yeah, nice

@Chris Andrade [41:59]: That's his wife, yeah, you have a, yeah, 6, no shit. I didn't know they made those. I never seen one. Apparently the 5 was notorious. It was the first vehicle to cross the North Pole to the North Pole. Wow, that's cool. Yeah, I know the Toyotas are great. I've I've I've driven scionss and Toyotas. I've had like 5 different Toyota Tundras, I think.

@Trent [42:01]: Yeah

@Chris Andrade [42:26]: Yeah Why Let me go get my laptop Hey, can somebody try something out for me over there? Can someone go to

@Trent [42:34]: Yep, yep

@Chris Andrade [42:35]: Qo.com

@Trent [42:39]: Yep

@Chris Andrade [42:40]: And then when you try to create a user Or a new account And type in Kelsey's.

@Trent [42:47]: Yeah

@Chris Andrade [42:50]: At Platter mechanics

@Trent [42:52]: Continue with email

@Chris Andrade [42:54]: Yeah

@Trent [42:55]: OK, Kelsey

@Chris Andrade [42:56]: Oh, but you can't cause you don't, you don't, you need this login.

@Trent [43:02]: Well, if I create an account I mean, I can see what happens. Oh yeah, I have to have an email. It's sending a code to his email right now.

@Chris Andrade [43:09]: Yeah, I Let me try my, let me try and do it from my left side. See, I can see, I can't, I can't, I couldn't get, get it to do that over here. So

@Trent [43:20]: It's possible it's different. You're doing it from an iPad or a tablet.

@Chris Andrade [43:24]: Yeah well let me log in for my my for my for my iPad, it has all my shit saved in it here. Hold on. Well, just go into the email, he just Sent to plotter mechanics. Where is this computer come from I just got this, remember? Oh, I thought you got that. I bought this. I haven't had a laptop. Like I have one, but I haven't carried one for, I haven't used one for like a year. He sent it this morning.

@Trent [43:47]: Yeah, you're working on your phone all the time.

@Chris Andrade [43:49]: Yeah, my sister-in-law kind of tried to convince me to do that, and at first I was against it because I used to spend hours and hours a day on the computer and then when I did, I just I don't know if I'm as effective, but That mouse is trick

@Trent [44:01]: Wow

@Chris Andrade [44:04]: Why is it that mouse is tripping me out. Why is it doing that? That is weird. Oh, it's a trail. Let me find it when it's when it's, so we go, it's weird did they give cans see this real quick? Yeah. So open up

@Chris Andrade [44:24]: Dude. That doesn't bother you What's that? The trailing mouse It, it made might bother me. I don't know. I don't use my computer. I think me out

@Chris Andrade [44:41]: It's, you know how when you get a new computer and you start pushing all kinds of buttons and you can't remember where you pushed it. And that is that what, is that what that is? I think so.

@Trent [44:46]: Yeah. Yeah, I'd like to ask you a bunch of questions, turn this on, turn this off, that kind of crap, and then you're like, I don't, I don't know, just, just go.

@Chris Andrade [44:55]: Then you gotta get Chat GVP out and ask him how to fix it.

@Trent [44:59]: Well, I mean, if you saw some of the stuff that Matthew and I've been doing with AI, oh buddy.

@Chris Andrade [45:05]: Yeah, I would, you know, Chad G cracks me up, dude. Like I, I finally, I just got the chat GBT account recently. Like I don't have the pro one, but I have the one where you can ask it questions and stuff, but

@Trent [45:06]: I got Yeah Yeah

@Chris Andrade [45:15]: Super stupid, dude Like it just seems like it I don't know what I, I, I wanna gonna say stupid, but it's like Well, it, I guess it's, it's not capable of actually doing anything, so it basically just makes you.

@Trent [45:30]: Well, not yet

@Chris Andrade [45:32]: Yeah

@Trent [45:32]: So you're, so you're using it like what most people start out with, with it basically has no access to anything but like the internet and to have a conversation with it.

@Chris Andrade [45:37]: Yeah Yeah. I shared a document with it the other day and it actually helped me locate the parts of the document.

@Trent [45:43]: But Yeah I heard about it. I heard about it, I heard it, yeah.

@Chris Andrade [45:50]: Yeah, yes.

@Trent [45:50]: So, so, but what I actually did, over the weekend was I had it set up a computer server From, from my laptop, I had it set up another computer. Like it, it installed applications and configured it and deployed services and deployed a website all

@Trent [46:13]: Using AI to do it.

@Chris Andrade [46:15]: Holy shit. Just think about that statement real quick. That's insane, bro.

@Trent [46:19]: Yeah, that's what we're doing right now. That's what Matthew and I are doing.

@Chris Andrade [46:23]: I mean, that's, I hear that this stuff is, they, they tell you that this stuff is and then they, then, then they sell you a bunch of bullshit. Hey, real quick guys, who will use QO? Is it my team, right?

@Trent [46:30]: Yeah Yeah, my team, yep

@Chris Andrade [46:38]: And then business website, is that latter mechanics? I guess what I was trying to say about it, I guess, is that it's very skewed in the way that the world is, because I, you know, like I've been asking it like, is the earth flat, you know, our Bible questions and like and it and it and it just, it, it sticks to the narrative that it's given. So like I, I don't really trust it because I, I feel the narrative that it's trying to give me is the one that they're trying to give me.

@Trent [46:45]: Yeah. Yeah, yes

@Trent [47:04]: I don't know that it's manipulated. Like, I don't know that somebody intentionally went into the AI and said, hey, when they talk about

@Chris Andrade [47:11]: No, it always has it only has the information they gave it, which is skewed and it's their preference.

@Trent [47:17]: It's cut off in 2024 or something like that, but anyway, so it went out and it researched a bunch of information to to gain its knowledge, right? That's what it's trained on. And because there's so much information, it kind of takes what most people say.

@Matthew Kerns [47:34]: On the internet

@Chris Andrade [47:35]: Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

@Trent [47:36]: Is generally how it works. It kind of, I wanna say averages, but it's not really averages, it's more complex than that, but generally speaking, if most people are saying one thing, it puts emphasis on that one thing. So,

@Chris Andrade [47:38]: Yeah. And I've also asked some questions in troubleshooting because this is what my clients are doing now, you know, they're all trying to use the GPT before I get there. So like I've asked it questions when there's really a problem, and it really doesn't know. Like it just gets stuck in like a loop. It's like it just

@Trent [47:55]: Yeah Yeah

@Chris Andrade [48:04]: You know

@Trent [48:04]: So one thing that can, one thing that can help you is don't have real long conversations with it.

@Chris Andrade [48:10]: Yeah

@Trent [48:11]: Because it gets confused

@Chris Andrade [48:11]: OK. Oh yeah, OK, that, that totally makes sense.

@Trent [48:13]: Yeah. It, it Yeah, yeah, so it's just like if, if you and I were to have a conversation, like for 12 hours straight, you wouldn't remember the things that we talked about 12 hours ago, right? It's, it's kind of the same idea

@Chris Andrade [48:26]: But it does It remembers everything, dude. It knows my dogs, my cats, my sister-in-law, more you put into that one conversation, it uses itself because it has so many things that you talked about and then every time you, every time you ask it a question, it referenced every single thing and that's that script. Hey, quick question. It says, anyone with the at pottermechanics.com email to sign up and join.

@Trent [48:36]: Yeah. Yeah, it can get, yeah, go ahead.

@Chris Andrade [48:57]: Allow me Auto mechanics.com email to sign up and join Workspace.

@Trent [48:59]: So I, yeah, I think that's fine. What that means is that like if Kelsey signs up and then Alyssa signs up, it automatically joins you guys together.

@Chris Andrade [49:13]: OK. OK

@Trent [49:15]: Yeah, so I think that's fine

@Chris Andrade [49:16]: So it's the mobile number is, so what 602-722.

@Trent [49:23]: Now, if it If it talks about pouring over the number though, and bringing it in.

@Chris Andrade [49:28]: So it's just verify It's just verifying don't wanna like text 602 722.

@Trent [49:29]: OK. Yeah, that's fine

@Chris Andrade [49:36]: 8932

@Trent [49:39]: Yeah, don't be porting any numbers like if it asks you that, don't do that.

@Chris Andrade [49:41]: You can do that with your phone? You know how many arguments me and my wife get into because he's sitting on the fucking thing? Oh, I guess my left cheek was on it. what's the code? Chris sat on my phone.

@Chris Andrade [49:58]: Let's see here 602-722-8932. That's my cell phone. Yeah, yeah, yeah, I got that. I need the code. Oh, the code, sorry.

@Trent [50:05]: Yeah, it's gonna send you a code

@Chris Andrade [50:06]: 32533. Bless you. Say hello. So it gave us a new number already.

@Trent [50:17]: Yeah, that's fine

@Chris Andrade [50:17]: Pick different Do you like that 632, it it it doesn't matter because we're gonna, it's gonna be my office number.

@Trent [50:19]: No Yeah, exactly. What's gonna happen is it gives us a number temporarily. We're not gonna use it for anything other than maybe testing.

@Chris Andrade [50:32]: Yeah, yeah, yeah. You guys are right it, want me to write it down? Yeah, write this down. 623

@Trent [50:32]: OK? But

@Chris Andrade [50:38]: 323. 7875. Do you guys got that? Or you want me to write it

@Trent [50:46]: 623-323 7875

@Chris Andrade [50:51]: Yup, yup. OK. And Continue So we are going, we have a starter for $15 a month. 23, it's a different billing terms.

@Chris Andrade [51:07]: Or scale

@Trent [51:07]: Yeah, I think, I, I think you have to go to the Hold on, I'm looking real quick. I was pretty sure that it had to be the business, but let me just double check that real quick.

@Chris Andrade [51:21]: If we have to upgrade it, we can, we can just start with the business one because I'm sure the starter, I think it might create.

@Trent [51:28]: Just try for free with the business. That gives you most of the features, so

@Chris Andrade [51:34]: Yeah.

@Trent [51:35]: The only reason I think we would have to upgrade is to get maybe some more features that are listed on the right, but I think Matthew, did you happen to look at that at all?

@Matthew Kerns [51:46]: No, not yet

@Trent [51:48]: If you go to the quo pricing page that shows you like the 3 different packages,

@Matthew Kerns [51:55]: Yup

@Chris Andrade [51:56]: The business one does a summary.

@Trent [51:57]: That's.

@Chris Andrade [51:59]: This

@Matthew Kerns [52:00]: Yeah, that's Probably what we're gonna need

@Trent [52:05]: We need at least the business. I don't think we're gonna need scale, so I think just go with business for right now. We can always change it, go down or up later.

@Chris Andrade [52:11]: That That's, that's the card, yeah. OK. 4246. You, you know, that's where. 3154 62

@Chris Andrade [52:27]: 82 5074 Or First name Kelsey. Yeah, I just pick on it, I'll see how it sounds. The United States

@Matthew Kerns [52:46]: It's interesting that AI call tags is the one feature that seems like scale has. I wonder how important that's gonna be

@Trent [52:53]: Yeah, I saw that Yeah, that, that were mostly interested in, right, the AI cold tags. I think what that does is it's doing kind of what we were talking about doing, where it comes in and you can look at the message to give it some sort of tagging so that you can route it, filter it, react to it, right?

@Chris Andrade [53:12]: Why, why is so

@Trent [53:13]: But We can do that stuff though. We don't have to use the $47 a month

@Chris Andrade [53:20]: Page

@Matthew Kerns [53:21]: Yeah, the only question is, is, is it more expensive for us to do that?

@Chris Andrade [53:22]: Of very Character because

@Matthew Kerns [53:26]: But we'll have to assess that, right? We

@Chris Andrade [53:29]: So monthly there's no, no, it got me good. He got me good OK, so now we're selecting business Sorry, I have to redo that number. Paste it, didn't you copy it? I paste it. I thought you copied it. All right, you ready? Yeah, 4246.

@Chris Andrade [53:50]: 3154 6282 5074 426.

@Chris Andrade [54:07]: 3154 I, I got 42. 6646282. You got 6283. 0 There you go. And the Kelsey, oh, the month is

@Chris Andrade [54:23]: 6:26 And the CCV is for for now. Oh thank you Teamwork

@Trent [54:37]: Makes the dream work

@Chris Andrade [54:39]: Yeah, buddy, country. Yeah, I gotta get rid of this mouse, bro. This thing's like tripping me out, like I feel like I got a regular mouse. No, no, I just got to change the setting. He has this delayed Tracker and so the mouse goes to.

@Chris Andrade [54:57]: Leaves a trail, my eyes are like, OK, so now it's only $32. Start your 7-day free trial. Start 7 day free trial. What do you make the password when you created the account? You know, it did it through the link. So we're gonna have to, we'll have to make sure we reset that up.

@Chris Andrade [55:18]: Yeah, I need, I need to know what it is, so I can put it in the system. so it says invite your team, each member that accepts their invitation will get their own private queue number, they can choose. Skip for now.

@Trent [55:32]: Matthew, what do we need for that? Do you remember? Or have you looked at that at all? Do we need to have an account

@Matthew Kerns [55:37]: So.

@Trent [55:39]: For ourselves

@Matthew Kerns [55:41]: For us, I think the main thing is that Kelsey, we need Kelsey to have the quo account And then, I mean Ideally at some point, probably Alyssa, but not sure.

@Chris Andrade [55:52]: What

@Trent [55:56]: Well, so how do we, how do we get access to it? Is it going to be the question right now, it hasn't created a password. All it did was send him a a a code to log in using his email.

@Chris Andrade [55:56]: First Like

@Matthew Kerns [56:09]: Yeah

@Trent [56:10]: And we don't have access to his email to go and check it, and that's not, we're not asking for that right now, so.

@Chris Andrade [56:12]: I It says I can log out where I can, I'll, I'll make sure I can create the password first and then if that doesn't work and you can't log in from there, then we'll create a team member. Option. I mean, don't, can we just

@Trent [56:26]: That's probably what we're, we

@Chris Andrade [56:27]: That or do we just need one admin account, and I'll just give you the password to it. Let's see what it says, let's let's let's skip for now and let me see. Oh yeah, add a password you sons of bitches. All right, all right. What, can we make this a generic password for, for now, or like what do you guys think it, make it plotter capital plotter.

@Matthew Kerns [56:49]: Yeah.

@Chris Andrade [56:50]: At 2026

@Trent [56:57]: Than an at symbol

@Chris Andrade [56:59]: Yep, 2026 at 2026. Capital plotter

@Trent [57:04]: With a capital P

@Chris Andrade [57:05]: Y P I'm just saving that information in here. I knew I didn't.

@Chris Andrade [57:25]: Save and finish. So save this. I see. I keep going LCEY for whatever reason. Sorry, bro

@Chris Andrade [57:41]: Hey, listen, did you make those accountsing job? I should the The guy? They sent you an email with their emails for the jagger accounts. OK, So it's asking, I wish, can you send me, like, how can I get you to see his computer? is there a way I can get a link

@Chris Andrade [58:02]: For Slack or

@Trent [58:03]: You're on the computer, right Yeah

@Chris Andrade [58:04]: On his, on his laptop. I don't know how.

@Trent [58:05]: Cool. Yeah, yeah Yeah, hold on

@Chris Andrade [58:08]: Give me

@Trent [58:10]: Just hold on. we'll get that. Hold on. I'll send you a link here in a second. Do you, I'll, what's the easiest way I can send you a link?

@Chris Andrade [58:19]: I need to plotter email. Yeah, Kelsey at latter mechanics because I got that email in front of me right here.

@Trent [58:20]: Email? OK. OK In the.

@Chris Andrade [58:29]: Yeah, we should have, we should have used the Now and you go on to test out your access remote.

@Trent [58:39]: Yeah, that's what I'm doing

@Chris Andrade [58:42]: What is it? These are tests that send text is remote access. Let's test it out What else you got going on today I gotta go see a customer that I saw last week that has a broken printer.

@Chris Andrade [59:01]: I got a cutter next door. I need to fix for this guy that I have all the parts for. I have I just sold a frames they already have Dober accounts somewhere. Do you guys have jobber accounts anywhere?

@Matthew Kerns [59:14]: I have a developer account.

@Trent [59:14]: Oh, Matt Matthew does.

@Chris Andrade [59:17]: That's telling

@Matthew Kerns [59:17]: So I'm working on

@Chris Andrade [59:18]: You, yeah

@Matthew Kerns [59:19]: I'm working on creating a link. I think it might just be that I need to send you this link and then you grant access through the link.

@Chris Andrade [59:26]: So I can't send. That's OK. Can you send any other ones?

@Matthew Kerns [59:27]: So

@Chris Andrade [59:31]: He's gonna send you a link And he said that you might be able to, he's already a developer. I, I clicked on the link and it brought me to this website and it says download, so downloaded it right up here. What is it? The remote access, OK. Yeah that's gangsters right? You click right on the download link and it just goes like that now.

@Chris Andrade [59:52]: That's cool

@Trent [59:53]: That's the plan

@Chris Andrade [59:55]: This looks like El wire You got it

@Trent [1:00:07]: Yep, I can see you, yep, I can see you.

@Chris Andrade [1:00:10]: Do you wanna, you wanna take over?

@Trent [1:00:13]: Well, I mean, the question would be, what's the mission? How are you doing?

@Chris Andrade [1:00:16]: Right here, so we're Right here. Nope, right here?

@Trent [1:00:21]: Yep.

@Chris Andrade [1:00:22]: This is the next step that this is asking for.

@Trent [1:00:23]: Yup, yup OK, so give your inbox a name and an icon called it

@Chris Andrade [1:00:32]: Looks like it works pretty good, dude.

@Trent [1:00:37]: I think we're just gonna do

@Chris Andrade [1:00:38]: I mean.

@Trent [1:00:40]: We'll just leave it as primary for now. I would imagine that we can change the name of it later if you want to. Manage calls and texts later, share primary with your team so they can answer calls and send messages to their own devices.

@Chris Andrade [1:00:45]: Yeah

@Trent [1:00:52]: We're just gonna do skip that for now. And then Let's make sure you never lose a customer to voicemail. Most people Won't leave a voicemail, but so no. Greets them Sure

@Trent [1:01:12]: Make the most of every call.

@Chris Andrade [1:01:15]: A call recording. That's cool.

@Trent [1:01:18]: Yep, auto call recording, call transcripts and summaries. Contacts, suggestions, AI call tags, which I don't know We might get that during our trial. Yeah, we get this feature during our trial, but we won't get it once it downgrades.

@Trent [1:01:36]: So. We'll get to experience it

@Chris Andrade [1:01:37]: Please. Yeah, and see if you need it.

@Trent [1:01:43]: Right. So Now that we have like a phone call or a text message, I could probably just text it real quick and let's just see what it does.

@Chris Andrade [1:01:55]: And or, Matt, do you wanna try to log in on your end? Over there and see if you can log in to Qo through Kelsey's.

@Matthew Kerns [1:02:04]: Yeah, I can do that. I'm, I'm looking into the jobber side too.

@Chris Andrade [1:02:08]: Or Macau, you can try logging in if you want. Or do they got some sort of a phone app or something probably. You download from the app store. Oh, I'm assuming, yeah.

@Chris Andrade [1:02:29]: Oh sorry

@Trent [1:02:29]: Testing from Delaware, Ohio. There you go. That's my number. OK

@Chris Andrade [1:02:33]: Oh yeah. Oh nice.

@Trent [1:02:35]: Popped right in there. So that was a text message, and that, you know, the intention is and the way that this should be working is that it'll be linked to your phone, and you should be able to access all of these things in your phone, but we can schedule routing too, like we can, if it comes in and we want it to go to Alyssa instead of you. We can set that all up. But we've just tested basic functionality of I sent a text message, it did work, and it arrived in her inbox.

@Trent [1:03:03]: So,

@Chris Andrade [1:03:03]: Yeah But most of the messages that go to a majority of them go to my cell phone, right, currently.

@Trent [1:03:11]: Yep, currently. They're currently they're all going to your cellphone. The mission would be, or the mission is that we're going to set it up so that everything for the business will funnel through QO So that we can react to it, so that we can collect the information and have it in one spot, so that we can start to give you ways that you can we can automate it or we can send you notifications when things come through, or we, you know, send you.

@Chris Andrade [1:03:38]: Can I park my cell phone number over here?

@Trent [1:03:42]: Say again

@Chris Andrade [1:03:43]: Can I port my cellphone number

@Trent [1:03:45]: Well, we will, yeah, that your, your business number or personal number? Are they the same?

@Chris Andrade [1:03:49]: Oh, my personal number and then just get a different number.

@Trent [1:03:54]: Yeah, I don't, I mean you can port any number over. If you wanted to. So I don't think there's any reason that you can't do that.

@Chris Andrade [1:03:59]: I'm just The majority of our phone calls that come to this company come to my cell phone over the office number. So like it seems like it would make more sense to port my cell phone number into this new system.

@Trent [1:04:05]: Yep. Yeah.

@Chris Andrade [1:04:11]: Then the off, I mean, eventually both of them I think that would be a good idea and then you could get some sort of sanity where if you don't wanna deal with business, then you can just, well, no, we're gonna have to because we're going to set up a system and we're going to follow the system and it's going to go through your system. And then if I get in the middle of the system, I'm gonna fuck it up.

@Trent [1:04:29]: Well, the goal is to try to make the system transparent, but it to essentially handle these things and route them where they belong, right? The best place for them to go.

@Chris Andrade [1:04:37]: And the more I, you know, I can, I don't have to get rid of my number today. I don't care. I can, I can just train people the other way like whenever they talk to me, I just go right over there and talk back to him. And stop communicating my personal cell and just transition people over to like, you know, teach them that way I don't, I don't want to just throw them to the wolves, just be like, hey man, send your messages over here. Let's pick this conversation up on the other number.

@Trent [1:04:47]: Yes Yeah, so what I need to investigate is

@Trent [1:05:05]: My understanding is that we won't be able to send text messages from your phone number for 5 to 30 days, and we don't want to do, we don't want to have that problem. So if we're porting your number over to quo, I don't wanna have a time period where

@Trent [1:05:22]: When people text you, you don't get the message.

@Chris Andrade [1:05:24]: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, shit, we gotta see what the, and the thing is, to be honest with you, nobody's texting the current number, dude, so it's not a big deal. Like I get very little text messages to the 6 to the Vonage number because it sucks to use. So

@Trent [1:05:26]: Yeah. Yeah

@Chris Andrade [1:05:39]: I've really been trying to force people over to Jobber like if they send a text over there, I go to a job where I say, hey, use this number and I'm trying to teach people, but it's confusing because they got my cellphone, my jobber number, my office number. Like

@Trent [1:05:50]: Well, we're gonna try to funnel that through one system so that it can go all

@Chris Andrade [1:05:55]: Yeah.

@Trent [1:05:55]: That's the mission is try to get everything to go through this system so that we can handle it automatically and route it as it needs to, and we can respond to it. So we can collect all those messages and make sure that we send you a digest of what happened for the day or what didn't get reacted to, or what were the activities for the day? We could potentially, if, you know, a message comes in that says, hey, I've got a plotter down, and I, it's an urgent situation, then we can route it to you as an urgent message.

@Trent [1:06:25]: Or if it's just something that's like, hey, I just saw your website and I'm curious about this one thing, you know, then we'll route it somewhere else, right? It's just like the priorities and the reasoning behind it. it's something that we can, we'll work through.

@Chris Andrade [1:06:40]: Oh yeah, that's cool

@Trent [1:06:40]: But Yeah, well, this gives us the tools though, to be able to do our magic.

@Chris Andrade [1:06:45]: But I forward my cell phone number over there like, and then it would just go to an extension like if you need service dial one or just like it is now and then They would hit just hit one or you hit one for Kelsey or I don't know, I'm not sure, but I could probably do something like that. Just, I don't want to be picking my cell phone number up and bypassing all the things that you're doing.

@Trent [1:07:05]: Yeah, I think maybe Hey Matthew, what do you, what are your thoughts on How to approach this? Leave the phone number as is for now, and then when we're ready to migrate his number.

@Chris Andrade [1:07:22]: Yeah. We'll get the 6026061.

@Matthew Kerns [1:07:24]: I think so.

@Chris Andrade [1:07:26]: Up and running and then like, but like there's no way for the customer, like we still have to use the jobber number, right? Like when we text from Joer like that's the jobber number, like they're seeing that, so like, should that be the main

@Trent [1:07:37]: Well, I wonder

@Chris Andrade [1:07:39]: Cause when they called the when they call the job number back, it forwards over to Vonage right now.

@Trent [1:07:39]: Well OK, so you, so you effectively have basically 3 numbers, right? So Vonage doesn't really get called hardly at all. Then you have

@Chris Andrade [1:07:44]: So I Really, I mean

@Trent [1:07:52]: Duper

@Chris Andrade [1:07:54]: Yeah, which seemed

@Trent [1:07:54]: Yeah, and you have Joer that forwards to that number.

@Chris Andrade [1:07:57]: Yeah

@Trent [1:07:58]: And then you've got your personal number.

@Chris Andrade [1:08:00]: Yeah

@Trent [1:08:02]: OK.

@Chris Andrade [1:08:02]: And I'm really trying to concentrated effort here recently since Jouber added that the text, the picture feature, which they didn't have all this time. It made it difficult for me to use it because I couldn't communicate with people the way I normally do, so I kept reverting back to my personal, but since they got the picture thing, I've really been adamantly like if somebody emails me or texts me, I go straight to Joer and I'm like, hey

@Trent [1:08:03]: So You know

@Chris Andrade [1:08:23]: You know, and that way Alyssa gets in on the conversation and she knows what's happening. A lot of times I'll just send the customer a message from Jobber, and then I mark it on red just so that she hopefully notices that I, there's an unread text message with a message from me going to somebody and then

@Chris Andrade [1:08:41]: They'll send their information back and then she enters them in the system for me and puts it on my calendar like I got Probably 3 or 4 text messages sitting in there that I didn't handle this weekend that are probably needing to go on my schedule today or something. I don't really know. Like.

@Trent [1:08:54]: And that's what we're hoping to automate for you.

@Chris Andrade [1:08:57]: Yeah, exactly, because that way like it could already just be there and I'm not, I'm not wondering like this and that, and I, I love the idea, dude, like I'm telling you what, like I, I don't know how to charger for this. Yeah, again we, yeah, almost out. OK.

@Matthew Kerns [1:09:08]: Ideally there'd be 11 number that customers contact and one number that that you use, and then we can do all the internal routing stuff. I hope we can, I think we can figure out how to do that, like,

@Chris Andrade [1:09:21]: Well, when we

@Trent [1:09:22]: I think we're, we're not ready to move any numbers yet. I don't think we're ready to move any numbers just yet.

@Chris Andrade [1:09:23]: Like her over

@Trent [1:09:28]: But it, it would be interesting that like we're kind of working through it right now.

@Chris Andrade [1:09:28]: No Right

@Trent [1:09:33]: Understanding How you use the numbers, helps us make our decision on which number to port, right?

@Chris Andrade [1:09:41]: We, we never call out of the 602-606 number. So there's another phone number that we have too, which is Alyssa Verizon number because now customers have that number because she calls out of it But they don't, did they call your direct number, Alyssa?

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [1:09:57]: Sounds like there's 44 numbers, yeah, I think they turn to for us it would be I don't know so.

@Chris Andrade [1:09:58]: Yeah. Oh they just The way that it works is if you call the main number, you got 4 options, 5. Service, it goes to me. Sales goes to me, supplies goes to Alyssa, Printing goes to Joe, and accounting goes to my wife.

@Chris Andrade [1:10:16]: That's the way the system works and it goes to all their cell phone numbers. So If they don't answer, then it goes to a voicemail. Like I have a generic voicemail and a list of cellphone on my cell phone, and I don't know what Joe's got going on over there, but we don't do much with.

@Trent [1:10:29]: And that's Vonage that does the routing there.

@Chris Andrade [1:10:32]: Yeah, I can show you it's, I can give you the login information or whatever, but there's a spot in there where you can just set that up and then I recorded the thing in there, so I just say, hey, for service press one for this, that, whatever, and then that way, cause the thing that I was trying to avoid is not allowing that first initial service call go to somebody else and not me, because that's where we lose the business a lot of times if I don't

@Trent [1:10:45]: She Yeah

@Chris Andrade [1:10:55]: Don't decide which way to go. If I, I need to decide whether that's a waste of time or it's not, and not somebody else because they, they make the wrong decision, then I got to call them back and be like, I know they said that, but this is, this is what we really because I'm trying to make money, you know, they're, they're trying to get to

@Trent [1:10:56]: Yeah

@Chris Andrade [1:11:11]: Whatever. I'm not, I don't like that missing phone call shit. I hate it, dude. I hate it when I call a place and someone doesn't answer, so I want someone to pick up or something. I mean, if it, if it

@Trent [1:11:21]: So if we can get, like you mentioned, giving us access to Vonage. I think that we're not going to change anything on Vonage right this minute. We, we won't, we won't change anything without communicating with you, but it would be helpful to see how that's set up so that we can replicate it or adapt it to our new system.

@Chris Andrade [1:11:29]: We'll go up to it right now. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah Are you looking at my screen right now

@Trent [1:11:43]: Yep.

@Chris Andrade [1:11:43]: Oh yeah, you can go to shit here, watch. So. If we go to Vonage just right here. And let me, I'm gonna have you log into it from over there real quick. well, I'll log in right here. So let me, let me see what my password is and stuff. Is it the Kelsey? I don't know.

@Chris Andrade [1:12:01]: What's that called? Vonage? Oh look, you already have, it's already saved. There's 2, hang on. One's my personal and then there's an admin one, and we need the admin login. So the way that it works, and I never fully understood it, like the, the, the regular login is for me to use my phone app, and then the admin account is on with you guys. So the, the admin is info at plot info at Plottermechanics.com

@Trent [1:12:17]: Yeah.

@Chris Andrade [1:12:27]: Oops And 4 in 4. I knew I had some fat fingered it. In 40 Man, this mouse is You want the regular, I think.

@Trent [1:12:43]: Oops sorry

@Chris Andrade [1:12:44]: Oh, they're out. I forgot. You wanna just type that in for me, Trent?

@Trent [1:12:47]: I

@Chris Andrade [1:12:48]: In

@Trent [1:12:49]: Yeah, I drugged the mouse across it and it took your cursor away.

@Chris Andrade [1:12:55]: There you go. Remember me. The past hit continue and see if it doesn't. OK. The password's gonna be May So capital MAY 91964.

@Trent [1:13:09]: Hold on

@Chris Andrade [1:13:15]: Me.

@Trent [1:13:16]: I MA

@Chris Andrade [1:13:18]: 91964 00, I forgot the Y. Hang on.

@Trent [1:13:28]: Got it

@Chris Andrade [1:13:29]: Oh That was not, nope, what does it say? this wrong password.

@Trent [1:13:34]: Didn't work

@Chris Andrade [1:13:35]: Hold on a second, man. After 6 attempts. Oh, the username is plotter mechanics, dude, back up, but It's, it's, yeah, sorry. It's not that Back up to where you logged in, it's not, that's the email, but

@Chris Andrade [1:13:53]: Yeah, back up again Yeah, get rid of that. It's that

@Trent [1:13:57]: Oh, username

@Chris Andrade [1:13:58]: Capital plotter mechanics. They should have them already have the past, yeah, just like that.

@Trent [1:14:05]: That

@Chris Andrade [1:14:07]: And the password's right there, just pick right here, look. Oh, it's trying to see on my face, crazy ass technology, dude. OK. Continue

@Chris Andrade [1:14:23]: I just saw a cringe face pull up when it looked at your face. All right, MAY I say it was 91964964. I know very little about once I get logged in here. There we go. OK, so it wants to send this password, which I like as safety. I had somebody steal a bunch of shit from me, so I don't trust people anymore.

@Trent [1:14:45]: Yeah

@Chris Andrade [1:14:46]: So every time we log in, do we need to ask you might need to, and that's fine. Just, just hit me up and I'll let you get in there if you need to. So Basically all I know about this whole thing is when I get logged in right here, I go over here to phone system.

@Chris Andrade [1:15:03]: Not now I go over here to Phone system And then I go down here to virtual receptionist. And I pick on that And then the main attendant right here, I need to edit this.

@Chris Andrade [1:15:24]: And then I don't know, the 401 extension whatever. If you hit zero, it rings at this office phone. I do have an office phone sitting over here somewhere. So if you hit 0, it'll actually ring to it, which I kind of like that. Because I, I, I use that feature, but We don't need an office phone necessarily, but if we need to get one, we can.

@Chris Andrade [1:15:41]: Like to have a physical one. there's my phone number, and then all I do right here Is that's my recording file right there. Oh, I got to go right here to schedule on calls. This one. And then right here.

@Chris Andrade [1:15:59]: I go to This It's a lot of places to go just to get to this dude. This is all I know how to do. 24/7 No, that's not it Hold on, hit done. The mouse keeps moving.

@Trent [1:16:15]: Yeah, that's my fault. I drugged the mouse crusher thing there.

@Chris Andrade [1:16:22]: What the fuck? It's right here somewhere. I'm pretty sure it's right here Where are you looking for? Right, where I edit the, oh right here call flow. There it is. Oh, so allow the collar to dial the extension directly, so it's just right here. So one goes, that's me, 602-722. So that's the

@Chris Andrade [1:16:43]: Service and then supplies and then sales and then Should we write that in that where it looks like you can edit the numbers right there, Trent? Should we write who's in, oh no, those are phone numbers. Yeah, so if you hit those extensions, it just goes, even if you scroll down right here, there's, I think 0.

@Chris Andrade [1:17:04]: What's the fight too low number That's Nicky's. That's counting. So that one's counting. There's only 5 extensions. Accounting's Nicky's. Services me Supplies is Alyssa Sales is me Grinning as Joe, accounting as Nicky, and I think those are their phone numbers, but that's the only thing I ever used this for. Like I don't use it, and then I, I have the app for my computer, but I never checked the messages there. I just have the app on my phone, so when a message does show up, like I'm just monitoring the icons, so if it shows up here, I, I, I'm the one that catches if somebody sends a message because no one else is really looking at it

@Trent [1:17:40]: Got it.

@Chris Andrade [1:17:43]: But like I said Last message we got there was December 16th. And then the 14th, and then the 9th and the 8th, and half of them are junk. So I don't, I don't tell people to text that number.

@Trent [1:17:57]: And all this really does is just gives a menu and then it routes to other numbers that are your personal numbers or your cell phone numbers, right?

@Chris Andrade [1:18:01]: I that It That's all it does. We, we don't, we only have one hard piece of hardware with Vonage, and that's a phone that's configured to this thing too, so you can now, you can make an Alababa call, but it's not that good, man. It's like choppy and scratchy and shit, so a cell phone's a better connection, so we never use it as a phone calling way

@Trent [1:18:12]: OK.

@Chris Andrade [1:18:21]: Because it's, it's not very good Like a cellphone connections much clearer. So, yeah, that's all I mess with right there. Like I know how to like back a little bit further was where I recorded my message that I wanted it to say, and then I just have it ring all the time. There's no voicemail in there, so that there's no mailbox or any. There might be, but I don't know how to set it up if it is.

@Chris Andrade [1:18:44]: So it just pretty much, is there a reason why, or when, at what point would we need to access Vonage

@Trent [1:18:54]: When we're trying to migrate any of these, basically whatever this functionality is right now, we need to just migrate this functionality over.

@Chris Andrade [1:18:54]: We're gonna get. OK Got it. And it's not hard to recreate it, man. I mean, it's just a voice recording and It, you hit numbers and it goes to different. I'm sure that other one has all this stuff in more.

@Trent [1:19:13]: Yeah, so it's this one right here.

@Chris Andrade [1:19:15]: What else? Getting into while we're, while we're, while I can help you. Do you need access to the inboxes at all or?

@Trent [1:19:21]: OK. What else do you need there, Matthew, what do you think?

@Matthew Kerns [1:19:29]: So I'm trying to figure out the jober, authentication thing.

@Trent [1:19:36]: Oh yeah.

@Matthew Kerns [1:19:37]: The, the email inboxes, you could, but when I get the job one

@Chris Andrade [1:19:37]: I do have a A Go ahead You're trying to figure out that oh for Alyssa.

@Matthew Kerns [1:19:43]: Yeah, I think Yeah I have this

@Chris Andrade [1:19:48]: Got it.

@Matthew Kerns [1:19:50]: I have this link that maybe that we can try. I'm just not sure if

@Chris Andrade [1:19:54]: OK.

@Matthew Kerns [1:19:55]: If it'll work

@Chris Andrade [1:19:57]: OK.

@Matthew Kerns [1:19:57]: But we'll try it.

@Chris Andrade [1:19:57]: You just, are you gonna send it to Alyssa's email?

@Matthew Kerns [1:20:03]: Yeah,

@Chris Andrade [1:20:03]: Oh, let me get my

@Matthew Kerns [1:20:07]: I wanted to confirm that it's gonna work before I send it, but I haven't done that yet

@Chris Andrade [1:20:13]: I got it

@Chris Andrade [1:20:32]: Oh that's me.

@Trent [1:20:52]: I did

@Chris Andrade [1:20:55]: I've been reading it I just read it

@Chris Andrade [1:21:23]: I just stand up for a second.

@Matthew Kerns [1:21:32]: So, OK, so Trent, I wonder, cause I know there's a way where we can get it connected directly in any then.

@Trent [1:21:44]: Yep

@Matthew Kerns [1:21:46]: So if we

@Trent [1:21:49]: I'm in it right now. I've been able to accept the invite and I'm in the account. I'm set up as an admin, so.

@Matthew Kerns [1:21:57]: OK.

@Trent [1:21:58]: According to what I'm looking at right here, it says set up as admin, so. Yeah, I see he's got a lot of emails in here.

@Matthew Kerns [1:22:04]: So

@Trent [1:22:06]: Yeah.

@Matthew Kerns [1:22:07]: We, oh, you have, you're in Jaber right now or in?

@Trent [1:22:10]: I'm in Joer Jobber.

@Chris Andrade [1:22:14]: Oh

@Matthew Kerns [1:22:14]: So you're logged in to Jaber

@Chris Andrade [1:22:17]: I just had to stand up for a second

@Trent [1:22:17]: Correct. I'm not logged in the quo, so we'll have to make sure we can get in the quo.

@Chris Andrade [1:22:22]: Oh yeah, are you an admin

@Matthew Kerns [1:22:22]: Thank you

@Chris Andrade [1:22:25]: Did you make him a

@Trent [1:22:27]: It

@Matthew Kerns [1:22:28]: I'm logged in the Quill

@Chris Andrade [1:22:29]: Yeah. You're logged into oll, Matt

@Trent [1:22:31]: OK.

@Matthew Kerns [1:22:32]: Yeah.

@Chris Andrade [1:22:33]: Sweet

@Matthew Kerns [1:22:34]: And I, I got the API key, so I think that we're good there.

@Chris Andrade [1:22:38]: I have another, I have an an email address that's called intake at plottermechanics.com that I don't use for anything if you guys want to use it for something.

@Matthew Kerns [1:22:48]: OK Hey Trent, can you, since you're logged into Jabber, can you click on this link I just sent in the chat, and that will pull up, I believe that will pull up my workflow. And then if you can share screen in Slack.

@Matthew Kerns [1:23:04]: I just wanna make sure we get, might have to copy paste some Secret Password thing, but

@Trent [1:23:13]: Yeah, let me, We got a lot of things going on here, so give me a second.

@Matthew Kerns [1:23:19]: Yeah.

@Trent [1:23:21]: And I'm all over the

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [1:23:21]: Anything I do

@Trent [1:23:29]: Chair screen This one here OK, so you, so here's Jabber. OK, so I'm logged in a jobber. I clicked on your link to get to N8N, and it did this.

@Chris Andrade [1:23:45]: I was going through the emails.

@Trent [1:23:47]: So this is your AA, so I don't have a user, but it might let them sign up. So when they

@Chris Andrade [1:23:53]: You know they have 600

@Trent [1:23:54]: See.

@Matthew Kerns [1:23:55]: OK, so I might need to Give you access or something.

@Chris Andrade [1:23:58]: Well, he approved

@Matthew Kerns [1:24:00]: To give me access, yeah. So our sandboxes are completely isolated, so it's, you'll have to give me access to.

@Chris Andrade [1:24:05]: I sold him my parents, the only difference is we're gonna give him a 2 year old, so we just need to make that say it has a 2 year warranty.

@Trent [1:24:06]: It.

@Matthew Kerns [1:24:08]: That

@Chris Andrade [1:24:11]: Instead of 1 And send him an invoice and he's gonna pay us. OK, so we're doing a two-year warranty. Yeah, so just making an invoice. And then the guy that I'm gonna be delivering it to isn't going to be available till after the 5th. So,

@Matthew Kerns [1:24:26]: So I can't add you as an admin, but I can add you as a member, and I just

@Chris Andrade [1:24:30]: For for for 5th and then.

@Matthew Kerns [1:24:32]: Sent the invite, here's the link.

@Chris Andrade [1:24:34]: Create the invoice for that How do you sell these 500 inks. See them. R Rain, rain dance Because we got it

@Matthew Kerns [1:24:46]: So if you click that link for the NA then sign up for my sandbox.

@Chris Andrade [1:24:50]: Those 3 blocks We were gonna be out doubles up.

@Trent [1:24:55]: Oh, here we go. Yeah, gotcha.

@Chris Andrade [1:24:58]: OK, well, just tell him we only have 25.

@Matthew Kerns [1:24:59]: I mean, if you're, if you're able to log in to Jobber,

@Chris Andrade [1:25:03]: We have in our

@Matthew Kerns [1:25:04]: Like after this, then we can also just do this another time too. Like we don't have to do this right now. If you have, if you're gonna have access to jobber, right?

@Chris Andrade [1:25:05]: Cases I think in here A desperate

@Trent [1:25:14]: Yeah, I have access to Jobber, so I'm, I'm logged into it under my account right now. So if you look at

@Matthew Kerns [1:25:21]: Oh, OK

@Trent [1:25:23]: Say right here

@Matthew Kerns [1:25:23]: Oh, and then we'll each have access. OK. Cause there should be, can you Well, OK, actually Just go to the NAN1.

@Chris Andrade [1:25:35]: Right.

@Matthew Kerns [1:25:37]: We gotta make sure that this works, yeah.

@Chris Andrade [1:25:39]: No, I bought these a long time ago.

@Trent [1:25:42]: And

@Matthew Kerns [1:25:44]: Basically the way that it's gonna work is you're, if you're logged into Jabber, you can click a button and add it in and grant access to that Jaber account to NNN, and then we can.

@Chris Andrade [1:25:54]: OK.

@Trent [1:25:55]: Got it

@Matthew Kerns [1:25:57]: Yep

@Trent [1:25:58]: Yeah

@Chris Andrade [1:25:59]: Yeah

@Matthew Kerns [1:25:59]: Yup

@Chris Andrade [1:26:01]: In stock at the moment

@Trent [1:26:07]: And I don't know what my username is Assuming, assuming it's my email, so let's go with that.

@Matthew Kerns [1:26:14]: I, yeah. Should be.

@Trent [1:26:35]: I'm kinda curious though, to the credentials carry over? Do you have any credentials in there now?

@Chris Andrade [1:26:42]: Yeah, they all have the same.

@Matthew Kerns [1:26:44]: I do, but they're for my test account.

@Chris Andrade [1:26:47]: The same company so I can.

@Matthew Kerns [1:26:48]: So

@Trent [1:26:50]: Yeah, so my login is gonna have its own credentials and your login is gonna to have its own credentials.

@Matthew Kerns [1:26:57]: Yeah

@Trent [1:27:00]: So what we really kind of need is the API key. If we can get one, but is that not

@Chris Andrade [1:27:05]: What's his company name

@Trent [1:27:05]: The way it works

@Matthew Kerns [1:27:07]: Like a job or API key. Yeah, I don't. Think so I was looking for that

@Chris Andrade [1:27:12]: Arise like A R I S E and then group. I don't know if you guys wanted to be fancy or not. We fancy Healthy to see you'd be fancy.

@Trent [1:27:30]: So Request an app, connected apps. I mean, I can connect it to mine and then I can just give you the password to get into mine.

@Matthew Kerns [1:27:45]: So I had a developer app, wait, so what happened with NA then? Are you in?

@Trent [1:27:45]: But I'm in it, but I am not doing anything because it will assign the credential to my NA login. Even though this is your sandbox

@Matthew Kerns [1:27:53]: Oh.

@Trent [1:28:01]: Our credentials don't cross. It keeps them isolated

@Matthew Kerns [1:28:04]: Can you go to work clothes Oh, is that the way it's gonna work?

@Trent [1:28:06]: Yeah. That's what I'm saying. Everything that I have is completely isolated from you.

@Matthew Kerns [1:28:14]: So can I give you like

@Trent [1:28:14]: Even though, even I don't know if we can share. I don't know how that works.

@Matthew Kerns [1:28:21]: Cause like, I would

@Trent [1:28:21]: To be honest, I haven't finished shared, there's a shared with you. Can you share

@Matthew Kerns [1:28:26]: Yeah

@Trent [1:28:28]: Share it with you I don't know You can share it to me

@Matthew Kerns [1:28:37]: I think so You can collaborate with others when you upgrade your plan, OK. Yeah

@Chris Andrade [1:28:43]: I'm gonna just upgrade.

@Trent [1:28:45]: That's you

@Matthew Kerns [1:28:47]: Yeah

@Trent [1:28:50]: Let's see, so did you ask, Claude or anything to tell us if we could do.

@Matthew Kerns [1:28:59]: Yeah, I've been working with Claude,

@Trent [1:29:03]: But it's not giving us the ability to do an API key.

@Matthew Kerns [1:29:06]: So I, I have a developer account for Jobber that like, I created a a jobber app. And that's how everything goes through, and then there's like a client ID and a secret there. So, we need to get the, the jobber account that they use connected to the app.

@Matthew Kerns [1:29:29]: And then once that's done, then I think we can We can basically hook up our individual credentials to the jobber developer app. If that makes any sense at all

@Trent [1:29:42]: So how would you get through, yeah, how would you get through to get that into Jaber, what you just talked about.

@Matthew Kerns [1:29:50]: So the way that I did it on my side is Well, if I can log in to Jobber, then I could just do it actually. Should I just do that

@Trent [1:30:02]: If you can log in and you're linked to their

@Chris Andrade [1:30:07]: Where he has to use

@Matthew Kerns [1:30:07]: How did you get access? to through your email?

@Chris Andrade [1:30:08]: Re.

@Trent [1:30:10]: I, I, I use the I accepted the invite in the email. But you can't do that, I don't think so.

@Matthew Kerns [1:30:18]: Oh, I can't

@Chris Andrade [1:30:20]: Well they

@Trent [1:30:20]: Well, the problem was that you already have a login.

@Chris Andrade [1:30:25]: Yeah, you, she said that Do you have another email? Do you have another email address we can use?

@Matthew Kerns [1:30:32]: Yeah

@Chris Andrade [1:30:33]: Just send that to, to Alyssa.

@Trent [1:30:38]: Or I can just do it right here, probably.

@Chris Andrade [1:30:40]: I, oh, yeah, cause you're an admin. Oh, there you go.

@Trent [1:30:43]: Yeah, I can, I can just add user, so if you just wanna give me the

@Chris Andrade [1:30:44]: Yes Yeah, he's doing it, don't worry

@Matthew Kerns [1:30:48]: OK. I'll just take my email address in the chat.

@Chris Andrade [1:30:53]: We will, we're already adding users for you.

@Trent [1:30:57]: Oh, that's the full name.

@Matthew Kerns [1:31:01]: Sorry, I missed that part that I. Already had the email, all right.

@Trent [1:31:07]: Good.

@Matthew Kerns [1:31:10]: OK, I'll log in

@Trent [1:31:10]: Yeah, it's because you already have an account and it doesn't have it linked between you and potter mechanics, so

@Matthew Kerns [1:31:17]: Right

@Trent [1:31:18]: Yeah URA Make an administrator.

@Matthew Kerns [1:31:23]: Do I need to create a jobbo account first? I think I don't, right? I just wait for the

@Trent [1:31:29]: Just wait, yeah, just wait for the Email. OK, so you, I think, look for the email.

@Matthew Kerns [1:31:38]: Yep I'm signing up now.

@Matthew Kerns [1:31:58]: OK

@Trent [1:32:04]: Hm I'll be right back. I need a drink of water.

@Matthew Kerns [1:32:13]: OK

@Trent [1:32:14]: Sure.

@Trent [1:32:37]: OK, that So what else do we need to make sure that we get from plotter mechanics, Kelsey.

@Chris Andrade [1:32:52]: Say that again

@Trent [1:32:53]: What, what else do we need I guess I'm asking the team here, like Matthew.

@Chris Andrade [1:32:57]: Yeah, yeah, I know, I'm here, your checklist here that, that I got, just making sure that I didn't

@Trent [1:33:02]: Well, we covered most of that. The only thing I think that we haven't really done is,

@Chris Andrade [1:33:02]: Up Number 4 But that's not gonna happen right now. Yeah.

@Trent [1:33:16]: Matthew, you said you're logged into Quo for water mechanics.

@Matthew Kerns [1:33:21]: Yeah.

@Trent [1:33:23]: OK.

@Matthew Kerns [1:33:24]: For the, the new account, I think that Kelsey just set up

@Trent [1:33:28]: Yeah, that's, I wanna make sure that we have access to that.

@Chris Andrade [1:33:32]: So we have access to quo, we have access to jober. You have access to Vonage, but you just got to get a text message and we, yeah, and if you guys need access to Vonage, just let me know and then we can send Kelsey a heads up when he's ready to get that authentication.

@Trent [1:33:44]: Yup. Yup, we got an idea of how it's being used. So, I don't think that we need it

@Chris Andrade [1:33:49]: And that.

@Trent [1:33:53]: I don't think it's urgent that we do anything with it right now.

@Chris Andrade [1:33:56]: And then I can go run to the bank and deposit that check.

@Trent [1:34:02]: That sounds awesome That sounds awesome

@Chris Andrade [1:34:07]: Anything else, Alice

@Trent [1:34:09]: I can't think of anything right now. I think this is more like, maybe Matthew and I were just working through some stuff to start getting it set up. We won't do anything that disrupts Business or making any changes on their end right now. This is really us just doing some

@Chris Andrade [1:34:26]: Back in, do you, do you guys

@Trent [1:34:27]: Backend

@Chris Andrade [1:34:29]: Have any email addresses of mine

@Trent [1:34:31]: Say again

@Chris Andrade [1:34:33]: Do you need access to any of my inboxes or anything?

@Matthew Kerns [1:34:37]: Yeah, well, I think email would be good access to have There's, but we need to figure out cause there's so many emails that we kind of need to figure out.

@Chris Andrade [1:34:47]: Well, we, well, what, so we set up plotter mechanics and moving forward, I think we should use Kelsey at Platter mechanics as his main login for what we're using, what we expand on, I think we should just keep it to 1 plotter mechanics. So that's what Qs set up on. Would you agree or do you have yeah yeah, no, that's fine. I mean, my personal one's fine. That's, that's cool.

@Matthew Kerns [1:34:48]: Like

@Chris Andrade [1:35:14]: I have a, I mean, I don't, I'm, I'm just saying like I have like the service, the supplies, the sales.

@Trent [1:35:20]: Yeah

@Chris Andrade [1:35:23]: If you guys want access, I have my personal one. I, you know, like I don't like we don't need like Joe's and Alyssa's and all that, but I just have, they all have their own username and password so I can share it with you if you need it.

@Matthew Kerns [1:35:35]: So if they, if they're the customer, I think what we're most interested in is the, the customer facing emails and then the emails that that interact with Kelsey, so

@Chris Andrade [1:35:47]: OK, so service info sales supplies. So how do we, how are you saying we need to get access to those men? Well, no, I have them right here. I can just

@Matthew Kerns [1:36:01]: Ideally we would have be able to see all the communications that we can, right?

@Chris Andrade [1:36:06]: OK. OK Oh Oh, you hit the, hit Kamenzi, you just erased it. let me just get cancel. Let me, emails too He's gonna email us the credentials to the emails.

@Matthew Kerns [1:36:25]: OK.

@Chris Andrade [1:36:28]: OK, so email credentials, and anyone else.

@Trent [1:36:40]: I think that's everything on the list. The only, the only question mark I still have is the

@Matthew Kerns [1:36:41]: I know.

@Chris Andrade [1:36:46]: Dude, isn't there supposed to be a to start an email right there? I mean what the fuck dude oh, like normally like a plus sign or something like how do you send a fucking email. All right

@Trent [1:36:57]: The A2P registration. I don't know. We don't have We'll need to have the legal business name and the EIN or the tax ID.

@Chris Andrade [1:37:08]: Oh, OK, here. I'm not good at I got Here Take a screenshot of that. I can send it to you on in.

@Trent [1:37:19]: Oh yeah, if you've already got it. If you've already got it right there, then we're good.

@Chris Andrade [1:37:21]: I wrote it. Oh, can you, can you, you want me, I, I'll scan this. And

@Trent [1:37:26]: Could probably If you take a good picture of it, or you can scan it.

@Chris Andrade [1:37:29]: Yeah, like, yeah, yeah, let me, I'll give it to you in digital format. No, it's fine, bro. It's fine. No, you're good. You're good, you're good. I, I could scan it with my phone and send it in this group.

@Trent [1:37:40]: Yeah, just do it with your phone and drop it right here in the chat.

@Chris Andrade [1:37:46]: Chris at The Ali POLY G. The polygenia.

@Matthew Kerns [1:38:05]: Very cool, yeah, I can access their data through Jaber.

@Trent [1:38:10]: Nice Is there any questions that we want to ask about workflow.

@Chris Andrade [1:38:21]: Good call Yeah, ask me I just said all my passwords, but you don't have to use them all.

@Matthew Kerns [1:38:34]: I think, I mean, so we'll be able to see the driver data, but I guess like just at a high level, like, We already know sort of like, how you use Jabber, but what are the main things that stand out in your mind of like, what, what are the main use cases of Jaber that get that use your time or or get in the way.

@Chris Andrade [1:38:56]: I don't understand the question.

@Matthew Kerns [1:38:59]: So like You go to update Jabber for client requests, or, or you don't do that. Alyssa does that.

@Chris Andrade [1:39:09]: I know how to do it. Sometimes I will, but

@Matthew Kerns [1:39:12]: Yeah, it's OK

@Chris Andrade [1:39:13]: Share ask for Alyssa. Or just like are you asking how they, how does the information get in there or

@Matthew Kerns [1:39:19]: OK Yeah, like what, what are the main use cases, I guess, like.

@Trent [1:39:27]: Like what, what's the

@Matthew Kerns [1:39:27]: Like

@Trent [1:39:29]: Like how do you use it as really the primary question, but what are the main ways that you use Jobber.

@Chris Andrade [1:39:34]: I think it's the jober like I was trying to tell you guys last week, like, as soon as it becomes a job, I like to turn it into a job and get it on the schedule. So Alyssa's just taking

@Matthew Kerns [1:39:37]: Yeah

@Chris Andrade [1:39:43]: My text messages I give her. I call her on the phone, she writes down no, she puts it in there. Customs email supplies or service or whatever, you know, sometimes that comes in like that. Sometimes they are texting jobber directly now that I'm teaching them how to do that. And so, I mean, I, it's mostly just me all day calling her saying, hey Alyssa, so and so, I'll take screenshots of my phone, conversation that I'm texting with them, and I'll just shoot it over to her.

@Trent [1:40:13]: OK, so you're taking a screenshot of the conversation.

@Chris Andrade [1:40:16]: Yeah, that's how I'm typically getting the information to Alyssa as I basically screenshot her conversations and stuff to her office phone that she has, my other Verizon number, and then As she, I try and do it like during the night or early in the morning, so I don't bother her cell phone. And then when she comes in, she, she's getting bombarded with like

@Chris Andrade [1:40:33]: The inbox, all the text messages I sent her and then like, she's, you know Going through all that stuff and, excuse me, hello? And sorting it out Let me go Any anything you wanna add to that to the team? Yeah, about what? About man, shocker on the cabinet,

@Trent [1:40:57]: Just the way that the way that you guys communicate through Jobber or the way that you update things through job or kind of, we're trying to look at the largest impact That we can have At the very beginning To help you guys So we're trying to figure out how you use it mostly.

@Matthew Kerns [1:41:16]: I can see that you use like client's requests, quotes, jobs, invoices, payments, right? But you don't use marketing.

@Chris Andrade [1:41:22]: Well, the only time that request happens is if the customer physically goes to my website and fills out that form online, but I don't like the way the form is. It's too complicated, so I don't try and tell people to go there, but they do occasionally fill it out. So that's a request, or we can make a request

@Chris Andrade [1:41:39]: But it usually starts as a quote.

@Trent [1:41:42]: OK.

@Chris Andrade [1:41:43]: Or a job. I, I mean, so normally the workflow is it goes straight to a job because when I'm talking to somebody like I'm already planning on doing the job, like, and so there's a little bit of a problem there because I tell Elisa to make it a job. But they haven't got a quote yet. I'll make it a job and then they're like, well, we haven't got a quote yet. And that's like, oh yeah, hang on, now she got to go back and make a quote and send it to him.

@Chris Andrade [1:42:02]: And then we got to delete my job that I made because it doesn't flow through otherwise, you know what I mean? Then you got like a quote And a job that aren't connected to each other and you can't reconnect them. So There's a little bit of a burden right there when that when that happens. If that makes sense

@Matthew Kerns [1:42:18]: OK. Yeah.

@Chris Andrade [1:42:20]: It's mostly a job unless it needs to be a quote, you know, like if I'm talking to people and they say, oh, I want to get a new graph tech, then I'm, I sent her a message. I'll be like, Hey, Alyssa, we need to send pro whatever a quote on an FC 9000-160. And then she's done that enough times that she knows what that means and then she just goes and makes it. She'll call me and say like how much I charge for your install fee because she doesn't know if it's in

@Chris Andrade [1:42:43]: California or across the street or whatever, so she usually kind of coordinates with me on how to quote it, and then we send it And then the follow-ups kind of messed up in Jabber because it doesn't

@Matthew Kerns [1:42:52]: But

@Chris Andrade [1:42:57]: Remind me to follow up on my quotes. So if I don't physically make a task to follow up on a quote that I sent, and I'm not deliberately going to check the quotes. I have to have her like make a task for me to follow up on the quote tomorrow because For some reason, a open quote doesn't go on your calendar. On tasks, only visits go on there, which are part of a job and not part of a quote.

@Chris Andrade [1:43:17]: So the only thing that shows up on the physical calendar is a visit that you create. You can make a job But if you don't make it a visit and add a person to it in a time, then it's just an open job floating around out there which there's a filter that shows it to us so we know if we forget to do a step or whatever like it does a good job at rounding all the stuff together so you have a bird's eye view of like what you have an invoice and what you haven't, you know, draft quotes and

@Chris Andrade [1:43:41]: All that you could filter by like stuff that you haven't sent yet that you're working on. So I'm assuming like every day I'll want to go into my draft quotes and Look at them. Yeah, I don't know how it's going to be, but that's how we do it. Like it's just me basically. Calling Alyssa every time I need something done because I can do it myself

@Chris Andrade [1:44:00]: But then she doesn't know, and she's not in the loop. So I stop Every time I get done in the car and I'm really trying to get Joe to do the same thing whether like, Joe, when you get done with your job, you need to call Lissa and figure out where we're at because like I, if I hand a job off to you, like you need to Bring it to completion, you know, like, because I can't watch over what you're doing and what I'm doing. Like I can see a bird's eye view, but if you don't communicate with me and you don't communicate with her and you put notes in the system

@Chris Andrade [1:44:27]: Like those guys are still down right now, you know, like, is there, did you schedule a follow-up for Monday because this happened on Friday, you know, like we really have to We have to really do things right then and there you can't, like I used to think like, I used to be able to be like, oh yeah, I'll figure out, I'll do this later, but dude, I can't, man. I have to like literally stop and do it right now or I don't, or I have to at least and sometimes that's like even hard to even just send a message to Alyssa trying to tell her what I wanted to do, and I'm not even doing any of the work, you know.

@Matthew Kerns [1:44:57]: Yeah

@Chris Andrade [1:44:57]: Oh, It just depends on how my day is and like how frustrated I am while I'm trying to do all the things I'm doing in the field and like the people that are calling me for stupid shit sometimes. They're like, Where's my paper at? It's like, I don't fucking know. Like, call the office, but like

@Matthew Kerns [1:44:59]: So if we get

@Chris Andrade [1:45:13]: I think that's a downfall on our end because we're not that responsive to people. Like that's been a thing that's happened like people will send us an order, but nobody will respond to them. It's like, hey, just let them know we received their order and that we're working on it. You don't have to tell them it's done or anything, but just like if you order some shit from Amazon, at least they tell you they've received your message.

@Chris Andrade [1:45:32]: You know.

@Matthew Kerns [1:45:33]: Yeah

@Chris Andrade [1:45:33]: Like two days later and nobody's even responded to him yet, and I'm like, oh shit, what happened with this? Oh, this is pretty good, but it's just hard. It's easier to see all the inboxes from my iPad than it is from a computer because I can view all of the inboxes in one view. As opposed to having to go to each one individually, so you can kind of see an overview on it, but if you're not paying attention, like I have 200 inbox emails in my inbox.

@Chris Andrade [1:45:57]: And I don't even know what the fuck they are, dude. I didn't even look at them. It says 206 unread messages. I hate that shit. I can't believe that it's gotten to that. Most of it's probably bullshit. I don't know because I'm seeing everybody's emails in my phone, you know, so I just, I don't really look at the warnings anymore. So I don't see a lot of things that I should be paying attention to because I'm just like when I see that 206, I'm just like forget that shit. I

@Chris Andrade [1:46:20]: It, it's not, none of it's like Life or death stuff, you know what I mean? It just feels overwhelming when I see that there's 200 in junk mails in my inbox or whatever it is, I don't even know. I didn't have enough time to to look at it.

@Trent [1:46:32]: A lot Yeah, but it all piles up, right? So a little bit here and a little bit there and a little bit there and a little bit here. So it just piles up. So

@Chris Andrade [1:46:36]: OK And then you don't take this, you just start start.

@Trent [1:46:43]: Yeah, so you're giving me gold. You're giving us gold right here by describing your frustrations and the way that you use it. So those things are going to be key to us getting you relief.

@Chris Andrade [1:46:50]: Yes And it's a lot better, you know, like last week. Alyssa called me and she's like, this guy wants a quote on a printer, you know, and I tell her to do the quote. She's like, Well, how much do you want to sell it for? I'm like, I don't know how much you sell it for. Like I paid 500 for it. It says it sells for $12 online. I, you know, and I'm like

@Chris Andrade [1:47:11]: I don't have time to really stop and think about even that kind of stuff. Like a lot of times it feels frustrating like I don't have someone to help me with this shit. Like look online and figure it out, but I need to be involved, hear that guys? But then like this guy, you know, I, I just said, look, we just sent a quote to WAPA for the same exact thing, just duplicate that and fucking send it. Like I don't even want to think about if I can make an extra 1000 bucks on this transaction or whatever, just fucking get it done or else we might not get it done, you know what I mean? Like, so, the guy hit me up when I was in the hot tub this morning and accepted my proposal.

@Chris Andrade [1:47:41]: For 100 And I like that shit, dude. I was like, really? And then I called him and convinced him to buy a used printer that I have over here. Instead of the new one and just give him an extra year's warranty because I already committed that one to WAPA, and I can't get another one. So he's taking my used one and I got the new one still sitting on the holder for this lady that I hope he's going to pull a trigger.

@Chris Andrade [1:48:02]: But like, you know, when I'm dealing with $5000 transactions like this. I don't want to be like, Where's my $20 roll of paper at, you know, it's like we don't sell paper, man. What the hell is that? I don't. It just gets like, it's too much, you know, like, I don't like to leave any meat on the on the bone or whatever, but it feels like it's hard to eat it all like it feels like we're just like got a big pile of steaks in front of us and we're full.

@Trent [1:48:26]: So, of those examples that you kind of just Told us about What would Be magical Like, what would it do in an ideal world. Automatically handle some of that for you.

@Chris Andrade [1:48:43]: I don't know if handling it necessarily, but bringing it all into one location where I can see it, you know, because like

@Trent [1:48:48]: OK. OK.

@Chris Andrade [1:48:51]: I, for me, like I sit down and I'm like, OK, like Monday mornings are pretty much every day actually. I sit down and I glance at my text message string, my personal one, all the way down until like several days back. And then I go into Jobber and I do the same thing, you know, and I'm like, what did we forget to do here? And then I go, if I have extra time, I go check my personal inbox and then if I have time after that, then I start checking the service and the other ones, you know, and I'm always kind of briefly glancing on him because I hate

@Chris Andrade [1:49:17]: To be in Mesa and someone emailed me from Mesa and then I drive all the way back in for an hour in traffic and then check my message and say, oh yeah, I was just in Mesa like an hour ago before I fought Trafford the last hour. Like, so I am kind of overseeing what's happening and coming in and trying to remember it all so I can be more effective when I'm out there because dude, I can't afford to get two things done in a day, man. I got to get like 5 or 6 things done, like, some days, and the only way to do that is to leave at 7 a.m. in the morning and get an early jumpstart. But if I'm fumb

@Chris Andrade [1:49:47]: Ling around all morning till 11, when I'm trying to leave in the morning, then I can't. I mean, I know we have a meeting right now, but some days this ends up happening to me when I come to the office. I'll just end up like Swirling around in here and not being able to Get on the road to go to my destinations and stuff. So just having a clear, and then also like, I just brought Joe on, so he's new and like he's trying, he's a, he's good, but

@Chris Andrade [1:50:10]: On the back end, not a great Communicator, I guess. He's very shy and timid, kind of, so he doesn't like to talk a lot like me. So I'm like, dude, you got to start getting in the habit of calling alyssa when you're done with your job and briefing her on what's happening and stuff, like just Like,

@Chris Andrade [1:50:27]: I guess like it would be in an ideal world, the notes would be there and they would be right, but that's not necessarily the case. So like my first instinct is not to go to Jobber and look for the information I need. It's to go into my text messages and my inbox and like Alyssa's getting better and putting notes in there, like she's got lots of notes in there, but they're more for her purposes and I wouldn't say I'm necessarily

@Chris Andrade [1:50:52]: Gleaning a lot from her entering all this information in their notes for herself to keep track of things cause I kind of have an idea that off the top of my head what's going on, you know, like I, I have that. Not as good as it used to be, but I kind of know the general thing of what's going on all around us, you know, the best I can.

@Chris Andrade [1:51:10]: Where not everybody else does But if I'm not involved in the communications and stuff, then I get frustrated too, you know, like if Alyssa takes on the thing and tries to help me and then obligates me to a service call tomorrow morning at 7 a.m. It doesn't tell me You know, like, that's not helpful, you know, like, so it's like there's a there's this problem, and I think it has to do with what you guys are talking about is processes like we don't have that process in place. Like I make the process up every time I do it, and therefore causing chaos and confusion. So like I'm diligently going to try and implement whatever

@Chris Andrade [1:51:44]: Process you put in place and be like, no, you got to call the office, dude. Like when they call me, I'll be like, no, here, let me call Lissa real quick, click, put it over there, let her handle it and tell them what they need to know, and I can move on to what it is I'm doing. She's very good about answering the phone for me when I'm in the field, which I appreciate, because I don't have a lot of memory tension. So like if somebody

@Chris Andrade [1:52:04]: If I'm doing this and then this guy calls me and then I call her and then she doesn't answer. By the time I get done being pissed, she didn't answer. I already forgot what the other dude called me about. And now I'm like going back in my call ag like who did I speak to? I don't know. So. Yeah Dude, this is gold. What you're doing for us right now, I'm trying to, I'm trying to explain all of the problems that we were experiencing. I mean, what do you have, Alyssa? What, what, what can I do better? What can I do better to make your job better?

@Chris Andrade [1:52:33]: Would make your job easier, a good idea to make your job easier. And besides attack you, as soon as you walk in the door and. Like I said, if I could like just read your mind and know exactly what you did at every cause I have to put in the notes when I do invoices, I have to put in the notes notes of what you did, and we have to too, like it's very important that me and Joe document what we do when we're there. So like

@Chris Andrade [1:52:58]: You know, you get busy and shit sometimes, but I try and keep my camera available and I take pictures of what I'm doing while I'm doing it, and then I, I feel like it gives the customer a better, presentation when they go to get the invoice to pay you and it shows all the shit that we did, you know. And if I don't see any notes on there because sometimes you're rushing around, you're too busy, you don't put notes. I have to call you. I have to say, Hey, what did you do on this job? How long did it take? What did you sometimes I don't put my notes in there, and I have to physically do that, you know, I have to stop. I have to go in there. I have to go to notes. I have to add my pictures, then I've got to, you know, I just

@Chris Andrade [1:53:28]: Dictate a message of what I did basically save it, complete the job, and then she gets a reminder that I need to be invoiced, but And it has a timer on it too, but I usually confirm my hours with her before because the timer's not perfect and since I updated my phone, it doesn't seem to be working at all right now actually, but

@Chris Andrade [1:53:44]: It's not 100%, but it does help when I go somewhere and I lose track of time and it's like, holy shit, I've been here for 3 hours, but normally I wouldn't have known I was there for 3 hours. I'd have to go back to my messages and shit and be like, what time did I get here? So now I have a log I can show the customer like, look, I was there for 4 hours Saturday or whatever.

@Chris Andrade [1:54:03]: So, I like that. I use the job or like I in an ideal world when I come in the morning, I wouldn't be looking at my inbox or my text messages or any of that shit because that happened yesterday. You know, this is today. Like I want to, I want to look at Joer look at all the jobs that need to be done, and then come in with that in mind if I'm going to come in here and get this shit together and I'm going to head out, you know, and then during the day while all that shit's happening, we're hopefully handling it that day so that tomorrow I'm not trying to figure out what happened yesterday and the day before. That's, that's really what keeps pulling my attention away, you know.

@Trent [1:54:38]: And what's like currently, what part of Jobber is not working in that sense.

@Chris Andrade [1:54:46]: I, I mean, Jaber is actually really Helpful. I mean, like

@Trent [1:54:50]: Mhm.

@Chris Andrade [1:54:50]: I don't use it as much as I could because I don't Fully trust it I guess.

@Matthew Kerns [1:54:55]: Yeah, it's not updated yet

@Chris Andrade [1:54:57]: I, I don't fully trust that everything is in there, but I do, I, I lean on it hard, you know, like, I mean, I come in the morning and then I look at my schedule and I look at what I'm doing, Joe's doing. And like I'm I always overcomplicate everything. So in Jabber I created additional users. So if you look in there, there's a service that supplies of sales.

@Chris Andrade [1:55:17]: And a printing one, and those are like departments basically. So like, I don't like to see everything that's on the service schedule on my calendar. If I'm not physically doing it, it's overwhelming when I see 15 things on Monday morning on my calendar. Like, I don't want to see the 3 or 4 things I really have to do. And then the other things that are in service are like waiting on parts, waiting on the customer, you know, whatever, and like we're having to push that stuff ahead.

@Chris Andrade [1:55:43]: So I mean, in like the quoting follow through thing is really good, especially if you use it, you know, if you sit down like if you really Deliberately say, oh, I'm going to go through check my quotes today, you know, like, or whatever, like it's all right there in front of you and then you can complete them and close them out and like, we've done the best job that I think

@Chris Andrade [1:56:00]: Of not letting it turn into a pile of shit like my QuickBooks. Like everything in there is up to date and fairly current. Like my old CRM has 5000 tasks I didn't finish. And it's just that it just already got so big of a task. I was just basically working for my CRM all day. I was like, what the fuck is this? This isn't helping me. So since we moved away from that into this, it's been a lot more. I can't really think of what would be better about it besides our lack of being able to communicate with each other. I don't think it's Jaer that's the problem though. It's just that process of how we do it, you know, like,

@Chris Andrade [1:56:31]: Like where do you put the notes at, you know, because you can put the notes on the job or you can put them on the person, you know, and like if I'm in the job, I don't want to have to go look for the person to find the guy's number, you know, these are things we've been learning like there's a note section there where Alyssa on the visit I have, it's not the job, but the actual visit. She'll copy and paste the person's phone number and name right there for me so I can just grab it because otherwise I have to go back

@Chris Andrade [1:56:52]: And figure out who am I supposed to be calling right now, you know, the way Joer works is they have the visit, which is what he sees on his cell phone. He clicks on it. The visit is pretty much the first thing that pops up, so I was that's the thing that's on the calendar at the top, but the notes are a separate thing. You have to click a different tab in order to get into the notes to see all the information and that's OK because it's all inside of that visit. The visit and the job are connected, so the notes stay with it, but

@Chris Andrade [1:57:17]: Not everything does. And we have customers where there's multiple people, you know, so I'll go into That's another thing that happened here recently, guys. Just real quick, I just thought about it. The way it handles contacts. Didn't used to allow you to have a company and then have multiple contacts within it. So that just happened recently. And so we were having to go from using capsule where everything was accompanied with contacts in it to using this, which was just like a person or some shit. I don't even know how they were doing it, but now it's actually a company

@Chris Andrade [1:57:49]: And you can add additional contacts under it. So before that we made a whole bunch of custom fields in there, and it's confused the hell out of me, man. Plotter Contact one, plotter Contact 2, and I don't think that the ones that are on the job are the same ones that are on the visit or the company

@Chris Andrade [1:58:05]: I think they're different layers of confusion or something. I don't really know. So, that was, that's not my fault. It was messed up when it was originally started, and I didn't want to bring all the garbage from capsule into here, so this only has QuickBooks. Data, and whatever we've entered in manually, but we've tried to keep this database fairly clean so I don't have all this garbage in it. That's all in capsule.

@Chris Andrade [1:58:28]: Where I keep my passwords And it also capsules also monitoring Any emails that I personally send in adding their emails into a database on the back end, so I have like all of the emails of everybody I've spoken to in the last several years. I've never utilized them, but we can extract them and probably use that for a marketing campaigns down the road or whatever.

@Chris Andrade [1:58:53]: So like, yeah, that data, the data, man, like I heard you guys say earlier like Jaber is going to be the sole source of the answers or whatever. Yeah, and like, I think that's probably what that would be the best approach for sure. it just doesn't have all of these.

@Trent [1:59:07]: You're already using it that way

@Chris Andrade [1:59:09]: Yeah, it just doesn't have all the fields like it it's, it doesn't do shit with vendors, so I still need a place to keep my personal shit in my email, my vendor information because you can't really, you can add a vendor in there, but they're a customer.

@Trent [1:59:09]: You're, you're OK

@Chris Andrade [1:59:23]: You know, like it doesn't deal with that shit at all.

@Trent [1:59:27]: So clients A a vendor would be a client.

@Chris Andrade [1:59:31]: Well, no, a vendor would be somebody you buy something from, like somebody you send POs to like this.

@Trent [1:59:34]: Well, yeah, But like Joer though, like, like Joer doesn't look like it has really.

@Chris Andrade [1:59:35]: This doesn't interact Yeah

@Trent [1:59:41]: A vendor that, yeah.

@Chris Andrade [1:59:42]: That's what I'm trying to say. So like, I still have my whole vendor side of my business where I buy all my shit from, so there, those guys are like in QuickBooks and in, you know, mostly in QuickBooks, but then also in capsules where I have all my information that I've

@Trent [1:59:48]: Mhm.

@Chris Andrade [1:59:56]: We never really updated QuickBooks properly with the information because we were using capsules, so it kind of stinks, but we didn't use the nose fields or none of that shit in QuickBooks, really.

@Trent [2:00:06]: Yeah, yeah I mean it That's where inventory management comes in, right? There's no, so we talk about vendors.

@Chris Andrade [2:00:12]: I And Java has a plug-in. Me and my sister-in-law looked into it. There's several plug-ins that work with jobbers, so we'll deal with that later. But yeah, that, that's, that's how they handle it. You got to get a third party thing to help you with it.

@Trent [2:00:23]: Yeah, yeah, I got you, I got you.

@Chris Andrade [2:00:24]: OK OK. Oh, I got a demo this morning. I forgot all about it. What, what's a demo? He's gonna demonstrate how to work the printer. Oh, he's going to do a demo. Oh, did you hear that? He's going to do a demo.

@Trent [2:00:35]: Yes.

@Chris Andrade [2:00:36]: I got him hot mic too, so look at that. So whenever someone's just

@Trent [2:00:41]: Matthew, do you have any

@Chris Andrade [2:00:42]: Printer, he'll invite them over and do a demo on one of the ones we have. I.

@Trent [2:00:48]: Yeah, if you can like record that somehow, that's awesome.

@Chris Andrade [2:00:51]: If you can afford that. I'll just keep my mic on. I'm just going to show that I'm just going to go over and show this guy some different printer options because he, he bought a 12 year old piece of junk.

@Trent [2:00:53]: Yeah

@Chris Andrade [2:01:01]: And I was talking to him last week and I mean this guy's been deeper into the cannon than I have. And I was like, dude, you're wasting your time. Like, just come over and buy something from me. So I got a bunch of used printers next door and I'm gonna kind of I already know what I want him to buy because I'm into like efficiency, but people have a budget in mind and they don't care about efficiency sometimes.

@Trent [2:01:20]: Yeah, sometimes it's more important for them.

@Chris Andrade [2:01:20]: They Yeah, but, but, you know, the busier you get the less time you wanna fuck around, you know. So I'm like trying to teach people the, the right way to do it, you know, like you can do it like this or you can do it like that, and I wouldn't want to help you if you're going to do it the right way. That's To help him, but I mean, I started just, yeah, I started out of my trunk, dude in my car, so I, you know, like the, I attracted a lot of difficult clients from the get-go.

@Trent [2:01:36]: That's right

@Chris Andrade [2:01:47]: From like the nature of a Craigslist and Facebook and all that. And now I'm starting to get into real businesses, you know, like they're, they're calling me and finding me online and seeing stuff about Google Reviews and whatever. So,

@Trent [2:01:48]: Mhm

@Chris Andrade [2:01:59]: It's getting I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm not like desperate like I used to be to do like a lot of things I don't want to do.

@Trent [2:02:07]: Yeah, yeah, that's, that's awesome. That's the way to be.
