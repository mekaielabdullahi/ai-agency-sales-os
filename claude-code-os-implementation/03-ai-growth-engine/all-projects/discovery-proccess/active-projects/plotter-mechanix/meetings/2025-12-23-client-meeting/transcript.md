@Trent [3:25]: OK. That's interesting

@Chris Andrade [3:29]: Speakers

@Trent [3:32]: Yeah, testing, testing, check, check. Mic check

@Chris Andrade [3:35]: Oh, I got you, Trent. Can you hear me?

@Trent [3:37]: Yup, I hear you

@Chris Andrade [3:38]: Yeah, I said oh, and I've got the news on. That's awesome. system and asylum claim. OK. OK. Hey, Kelsey, you there? Yeah. Trey, can you hear me?

@Trent [3:49]: Yup

@Chris Andrade [3:50]: OK. Hey, so, sorry, my camera wasn't set up. So Kelsey just was made aware of that he is using or he is paying Jaber for a text messaging feature.

@Chris Andrade [4:06]: And he said he's paying a lot of money. Kelsey, you don't know how much, are, do you?

@Trent [4:11]: He's paying 3

@Chris Andrade [4:11]: I mean, I have a job like $400 a month.

@Trent [4:14]: Yeah, he's paying $350 a month is the thing he's on.

@Chris Andrade [4:15]: Like I think more than that. He said you're paying $350 a month.

@Trent [4:22]: Plus tax, yeah.

@Chris Andrade [4:23]: OK, cool. I could be paying as much as they want me to. I mean, if they got, they keep trying to call me and tell me to have this and that on my thing. I, I just tell them I don't have time for it. but what I

@Trent [4:32]: Yep

@Chris Andrade [4:34]: What I'm saying is that I just noticed on my iPhone. Do we, do we have the other guy on the phone or yeah, he's he's listening to you.

@Trent [4:44]: Yeah, I got you

@Chris Andrade [4:46]: There's an option in the iPhone to use your default calling app and you can change it from like the phone to like Vonage or WhatsApp or whatever and I'm wondering if that would be that way with duo, but I can't download the app because I don't know what it's called. I can't find it, or I don't know if they have it.

@Trent [5:02]: Yeah, there, there should be an app for it. Let me just check real quick.

@Chris Andrade [5:07]: Quote. I'm just trying to nail it down to where, cause Alyssa has that office phone too, and she's calling people and they're calling it and stuff and texting it and. Like, I don't really, I want, I want that all to be going through the same avenue when you called me, Kelsea just a little bit ago, you asked me what numbers showed up. May I ask why did you ask that?

@Trent [5:21]: Well,

@Chris Andrade [5:27]: Well, because I, I switched to setting on my iPhone to switch to In the under phones it says change your default app and I change it to Vonage. But when I called out, I guess it showed up still as my iPhone. I thought it would show up as my Varnish number. So you just turned that switch on, through the, through your phone, and he sent me a text message, a picture of that setting. You go to apps and you go to phone, it says choose your default app.

@Chris Andrade [5:56]: I mean, I'm just, I noticed that because I'm not going to, I mean, I'm gonna be making all my outbound calls from my cell phone, which is going to make people want to talk to me on my cell phone.

@Trent [6:05]: Yup, yup. Yeah, we understand. So that's, that is part of the plan for QO QUO. There is an app, so it's QUO. You can also look up the name OpenPhone.

@Chris Andrade [6:06]: Yeah Yeah.

@Trent [6:19]: It's the old name of it, but he

@Chris Andrade [6:21]: Oh yeah, that's what it said. It said formally open phone. OK, that is the app because the icon looked weird. It's like this yellow thing.

@Trent [6:27]: Yep, yup, that's the one, that's the one that you would be using, but we haven't done anything.

@Chris Andrade [6:31]: OK, uninstall it

@Trent [6:34]: You can, you can, yeah, you can install it and you can try and play with it if you want, but my caution to you is that it doesn't have your business number, and if you're gonna be calling

@Chris Andrade [6:34]: And see Oh, no, no, I'm not gonna do anything like that, bro. I'm just gonna see if it becomes an option for me to use it as my default calling app once I install it because I'm assuming what's happened, all that other shit is installed in. OK, got you, got you, OK, yeah, that's all I wanna know. I just want to know if that's it, because that way I can turn that on on on like

@Trent [6:53]: Sure, yeah Yes Yes, I love it. yep. Test it and try it. Yup.

@Chris Andrade [7:06]: I can give Joe a phone and Alyssa phone and just turn that on so when they do make an outbound call it shows up as the office number and not the cell phone number.

@Trent [7:14]: Exactly. Yeah, that sounds awesome. Yeah, try it out.

@Chris Andrade [7:15]: It I'm trying to tell Chris earlier is like when Part of the main thing that I really liked about Jabber and the reason I was trying to get to it is I had two cell phones and I had a mirror of it, so Alyssa had my messages at the office and I had the same thing, but they weren't really the same, and they just we couldn't commun. It was a mess, dude. So once I was able to get into Joburg, you know, I've been trying to push all the communication over there, but all my outbound calls come from my cell phone. They just call me right back and text me on it, and they're all confused. They're like, dude, you got this number, that number, this other number. I'm like, yeah, fuck, it's fucked. I don't know Jonesy, I've honestly, since I've known it,

@Chris Andrade [7:51]: It was been like that too Yeah, cause I have that I have my cell phone, my office number, which is what I've used on my stickers and shit, not recently I've been just using my cell phone. Because the website won't work. People keep calling me to place an order. They're like, Oh, I can't do this. I'm like, just text me here from Jobber and I'll take your order right now and then I'll fix the website later.

@Trent [8:02]: Yeah So, so quo or Qo we are going to have the ability that you can make those phone calls from hopefully any phone that you have, and it'll be the same number and it also integrates with Joer. So if you're in Jober and you touch on your contact phone number for whoever your client is, it can automatically just use Qo to call him.

@Chris Andrade [8:22]: Yeah Yeah. Well then we need to look at that closer really quick because I'm paying Joer like I believe, I think, you know, a significant amount of money for that number and that and it's just confusing because

@Chris Andrade [8:49]: Now I have an extra number. So if we can switch the communications from I really like the way it's in Jaber, you know, because it's like, hey, do you want to text this guy copy of his invoice, and I, you know, with Alyssa, she doesn't understand, like, I'm like, look, send it to their texts, man, like

@Chris Andrade [9:06]: If they don't check their email, like surely they're looking at their messages and I start the conversation with history. So when it gets time to pay and they stop talking to me, it's like, what the fuck, you know, like they were talking to us when it was broken, but now they're not like just reach back out to them on the same way we communicated, the way they're going to communicate with us next time, but so anyways, I don't know how to fix it, but

@Chris Andrade [9:26]: I don't know if we can still, I would rather bring it all into one location and just have a single number and not have to.

@Trent [9:33]: Yup, that's the message. yep, that's the mission.

@Chris Andrade [9:33]: So I think Job or text messages to look like another number whatever. I'm just, you guys know what's up. I, I just don't like it the way it is right now.

@Trent [9:37]: Yup. Yeah, yeah. We, yeah, we understand completely. And that's actually a little bit of a problem for us too to help build systems to improve this, is that we need everything to funnel through one system.

@Trent [9:56]: So.

@Chris Andrade [9:56]: I agree with you. I 100% I mean whatever we got to do to change what we're doing, even though it might suck for me to not be able to text straight out a job or I guess I'll have to do it, but I, if, if at least we could

@Trent [10:05]: That we

@Chris Andrade [10:07]: Databases, so the phone numbers were in there, that would be ideal, you know.

@Trent [10:11]: Yeah, yeah, everything will be, everything will be linked and unified. That's what we're working on. So, that

@Chris Andrade [10:18]: And and. That's amazing, yeah, OK

@Trent [10:20]: Yeah, yeah. That's what we're working on. We know what the priorities are to make this easier to manage communication between you and your clients and your internal team, and then also set you up so that we can improve our ability to communicate in the future.

@Trent [10:37]: So,

@Chris Andrade [10:38]: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, no, OK, good. All right, well, we're on the same page. I just saw that little feature in the phone and while I was thinking about it, I thought I'd mention it because it seems like I don't want to use that.

@Trent [10:46]: Yeah Yeah, try it out, man. Yeah, just, I, I'm pretty sure that that's a core functionality of QO. So.

@Chris Andrade [10:55]: OK, perfect. I'm gonna load the app. I just gotta get the password to put in here and then I think we're good to go

@Trent [11:00]: Right on.

@Chris Andrade [11:01]: That's what you put for big bud So I think that that's all I had at the moment. I that that's really been going on in my mind because we're doing this. I, I, and I'm just like trying to bring up as many issues and problems you've heard it, Kelsey, because when, whenever like we had our my parents I was telling them the same thing. When you come across shit

@Chris Andrade [11:22]: Call me, and either or just leave me a voice message because yeah, that's how we can hone in on the actual problems. I mean, I have ideas all day long. Like I don't want to like confuse you guys and stop everybody's day for 15 minutes, but like, what's the best way like

@Chris Andrade [11:39]: Your system or whatever of a concern or whatever, like just send it to Chris or is there like a group chat or how do you want to do that? Right now, we're still working at Outcasts just right now, just send it to me, even like a voice message, you know how you could send a voice text. Dude, just send that just like, do you prefer the voice text over the

@Chris Andrade [12:03]: Yeah, I'm translated one because the translated one doesn't always make sense.

@Trent [12:03]: Wow. Yeah

@Chris Andrade [12:09]: Yeah, I just, yeah just your, your 50-minute dialogue if you need and just send it to my way, and then that actually helps us in the long run, cause everybody we can process that easier. Yeah, I know. OK, cool. Yeah, I'll I'll get in the house. I'll, I'll start just with you specifically. I'll just start doing that with you because I don't, I don't really use that feature, but I need to get in the habit of recording myself, I guess when I want things done dude, I use it as voice memos all day. That's like the the you'll, it just makes your life easier

@Chris Andrade [12:39]: The more you start, you know, back in the day, like In an ideal world, I used to have a voice recorder, man, like, this is back like 2 years when it first came out, man, they were like hanging on my neck. I had this thing and I literally, that's how I did my living, dude, because one day I forgot a bunch of shit one day and my boss, I got pissed. I threw a tantrum in the office because I forgot the keyboards for this computer lab that I'd spent like 2 weeks building and this and that, and I drove all the way across town or maybe I went to Flagstaff, I don't know. And I got all pissed off through a tantrum, and my boss goes, this is the coolest athlady you've ever met, dude. She looks at me. She goes, K

@Chris Andrade [13:12]: El se y would it help you if I just made a list for you in the morning, and I looked at her and I was like, that is insulting. I started this dude, you know, I started to make a fucking list, dude, and I wrote it down like I and I couldn't, I wasn't good at it. I didn't really know how to use technology, but I got one of those recorders, and every time something would pop in my mind, I would record it. Exactly, bro. You need to go back to your roots.

@Chris Andrade [13:35]: I know, man, and then I'd go back home and I'd have to deal with all this shit I recorded though, and I hate, I hated that, but I would get back to work late. I'd do all the shit that was on my recorder that night and I be fresh in the morning because I want to come in the morning fresh and I can't, I can't come in the morning fresh anymore, bro. I come in and I'm like, fuck. I used to, but that's, that's something I haven't been able to accomplish much at all since I've been a business owner, you know, like we're talking pre. I worked for somebody else and I didn't have anything to do but just a job, you know, like, no, we're going to get you there

@Chris Andrade [14:05]: Big guy, and yeah, I highly encourage you when you have an idea, just open up my text, hit that recorder, and just fire away. OK, OK, I'll let you guys get to it then. I'm gonna got things if we don't talk before the holidays, man. Merry Christmas to you, but yeah, if you need anything just reach out, right? for you guys.un comes up and you have a question, I really, I mean this like just calm. OK, I'll make sure the guys have your number too to know the answer, just call.

@Trent [14:25]: Yeah

@Chris Andrade [14:35]: He literally look like fault. Dan only to the outside of it. Got it. So Alright guys, see you

@Trent [14:44]: Yeah, see ya, Mer Christmas

@Chris Andrade [14:46]: Thank you. Later, buddy So I think that's a good way to handle it, right? When they have issues like that, just send me a voice message, right?

@Trent [15:04]: Yeah, as long as it's easy to get the transcript from it, that would be the big thing is that we just need to have some way that it's easy to get transfer.

@Chris Andrade [15:10]: Fireflies and then just transcribed that over.

@Trent [15:14]: Yeah, that's fine. I mean, if you, if you can just dump it in fireflies to get, to help us with the transcription. We can take audio and transcribe it, we can, but that's gonna take an extra manual step. So if we can use the tools that we have to use their capabilities to give us a transcript. That's better.

@Chris Andrade [15:20]: Yeah OK. This is also down the road, but it wouldn't be very helpful cause this is gonna be a process that we keep going, especially with like my mom and Kelsey, is if we can build a bot or a channel where I can just take those voice recordings and upload it to it and then automatically transcribe it down the road. I don't know if that's possible, but

@Trent [15:50]: No, no. So I want, I want you I want you to pretend like you're the client right now. Like, we're having this conversation right now. I want you to pretend like you're my client.

@Chris Andrade [15:57]: Mhm. Mhm.

@Trent [16:02]: And I want you to tell me those things or write them down in in a way of ideas for things that we need internally Because I wanna make us You know, as efficient as possible as well. So, if we need a tool that we give to our clients that somehow they are feeding in their ideas.

@Trent [16:25]: Let's figure out what that looks like

@Chris Andrade [16:27]: Got it I think that would be, cause honestly guys, if we keep with the way we're, like the way this is playing out, everything is all being from voice, right? I mean, every, it's how it's all coming through, so

@Trent [16:43]: Yeah, so,

@Chris Andrade [16:44]: I feel like that tools that would be very handy for us as internal, you know.

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [16:48]: Help

@Chris Andrade [16:50]: Yeah, yeah, I'm with you. I'm with you. So I'm already, I already have in the vision, I already have

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [16:50]: Yeah, yeah. That Yeah

@Trent [16:57]: In planning stages right now, a full knowledge base for all of our meeting transcripts and messages and things. and there's a way that Is planned for us, for us to be able to put in audio files, so we can just try to implement that both for us and for

@Chris Andrade [17:10]: Oh

@Trent [17:20]: Client ideas So

@Chris Andrade [17:23]: Audio, OK. Cool. All right, well, that just popped up, so I didn't mean to call you guys in. I could have handled it, but I figured let me just, let me just try to reach out if possible. I don't know if that was the best way possible, but that's gonna be something that we're gonna have to figure out too, it's like, oh, how do we handle on the fly situations. OK, hop that one up.

@Trent [17:46]: Yep, yep. So what we, like in the future, what might be ideal is like and if there's A specific reason why you need a specific person on the call, you, you pull them in, right? But if there's not a reason to bring someone specific into the call, if you can just listen somehow and record them, so that we can put that into our pipeline of processing, whatever that looks like, right?

@Trent [18:14]: Then, then it's not necessary to bring other people in, but we're still figuring that part out, right? So that would be down the road, we figure out how, you know, hopefully soon, soon, actually, the, we have a real quick way that we can take these either audio clips or messages or texts or whatever and turn them into something that we can use.

@Trent [18:35]: Right? So

@Chris Andrade [18:37]: Yeah, you got my gears spinning. I think I can. I'm if I'm, if you guys think that's what I should do and

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [18:42]: Yeah.

@Chris Andrade [18:45]: Is create What I would see a beneficial system.

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [18:48]: Yes

@Chris Andrade [18:53]: To Make sure these moments, these issues get, I guess, not only managed but delegated properly. And how that looks, that'll be fun for me to kind of take over the, the, you know, think about it on the holidays to come up with a plan. So, over Christmas break.

@Trent [19:13]: Yeah, so one thing to just give you an idea of what I'm working on here is, let me see if I can find the diagram real quick. Man, there were We're trying to do multiple things in the background here, but the market's running sideways, so I I guess I'm just.

@Chris Andrade [19:30]: Right, I hate changing gears like that.

@Trent [19:35]: Yeah, yeah, but I've been trying to pay attention to the market too, and I just I'm, I'm ready for the day, but it looks like we're, it looks like we're running sideways. So I may not have a lot.

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [19:44]: Good. I didn't, I didn't even try. I had my eval today for work and I was trying, I, I, I lick, I looked at the market this morning, and I was just like, man, all right, we have to fill that new week out. And I was like, OK, but after that, I don't even know, and then it's holiday, isn't like news, isn't even like, you know, so I was just like, let me not, like, there's so much going on, you know, and then I saw your video on the AutoCloud. I was just like, dude, that, that was so sick. I started messing around with that a little bit.

@Chris Andrade [19:50]: Oh

@Chris Andrade [20:12]: Video

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [20:13]: And I was just an operation too.

@Trent [20:15]: I'm not sure where that fits just yet, but it looked interesting, so.

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [20:18]: Yeah, it did

@Trent [20:20]: Yeah, so anyway, OK, what I'm working on, let's see if it gives me an architecture drawing here. It that's the automation layer. Let's put this away. Go away.

@Trent [20:38]: OK, so this is the first stage. Of our knowledge.

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [20:41]: Mhm.

@Trent [20:44]: Plan I'm focused on notion right now. Because that I think it it has most of the core features that we need.

@Chris Andrade [20:49]: Mhm.

@Trent [20:54]: And it's gonna have databases inside of it that are going to be for clients, projects, and deals, tasks, and meeting notes. These are like the core things that we need right now,

@Chris Andrade [21:05]: Right

@Trent [21:06]: OK. there's plenty more that we need to work on, but this is the core things that I'm working on. So

@Chris Andrade [21:13]: I take this real quick.

@Trent [21:15]: Yeah

@Chris Andrade [21:16]: Give me one second

@Trent [21:16]: Yes. Yep.

@Chris Andrade [21:22]: All right, got it

@Trent [21:24]: Yeah, so, so this is the core thing that I'm working on right now, OK? It's, I'm currently in the planning stages and then I'm going to work on implementing it later today.

@Trent [21:40]: Maybe once we get off this, this call. So, but going back to more of a broader picture. OK Let's see, how everything links together. I gotta see.

@Chris Andrade [21:52]: That one.

@Trent [21:54]: Say what?

@Chris Andrade [21:55]: I think another picture of that one

@Trent [21:57]: Hold on, let me get you. Let me get the best, the best one before you start taking screens.

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [22:03]: Going crazy.

@Trent [22:06]: I mean, I can give you, I can give you this chat, but I'm telling you right now it's long. This is a long one. I've been, I've been chatting with it all morning. So, and I've been up since, I've been up since 6 a.m. so.

@Chris Andrade [22:06]: Yes. Well, see. It It would give me a insight to how you process, so I would greatly appreciate it.

@Trent [22:23]: I'll just dump it in the chat right now. It's actually probably not the best for me to give it to you right now, because we're actually changing topics currently, but

@Chris Andrade [22:25]: We I mean, what if you wanna email it to me later, that's fine. I don't care. Hey you just.

@Trent [22:34]: I'll just, I'll I'll, I'll DM you on this one, or I'll put it in our I'll put it in our group chats.

@Chris Andrade [22:37]: Yeah.

@Trent [22:40]: OK

@Chris Andrade [22:41]: OK

@Trent [22:42]: If I can get

@Chris Andrade [22:42]: Why is just I've been like, every time you guys are working on that workspace, like I nerd out on just seeing you guys. Yeah, I see your charts back there. Look at that.

@Trent [22:55]: So I gotta stop sharing for just a second. I don't know why I can't get slack to pop up. There we go.

@Chris Andrade [22:56]: I, I, I kind of No dude, I don't mean to be a pain in the ass.

@Trent [23:03]: You know, you know, it's OK It's OK. But let's see, something, I need the main Here it is. OK All right. So I'm just gonna I'm gonna post it actually in Do

@Trent [23:21]: Oh, where am I gonna put that? Ops general, Ops Resources, Ops Meetings. I'll just put in ops to meetings, no, ops general.

@Chris Andrade [23:32]: Did you guys hear about GJI's bullshit. So this drone This is an RTK drum, because of this thing right here. Right? $7000 drone, and I'm pretty sure this new band just made this thing useless.

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [23:50]: Why is that

@Chris Andrade [23:52]: Because the software to connect to this RTK sensor is not working now. Look, keep going, sorry. It's, I'm like staring at this problem right now in my face, cause A client wants me to do a freaking topo, you know, I can't.

@Trent [24:13]: So, here's A architecture drawing of All of our data sources and all of our things that we are collecting and need to link together. There's gonna be things that are missing out of this that are edge cases, but this captures most of it.

@Trent [24:36]: Where at, let's forget super bass for a moment, but in the middle we've got like Gmail, Google Calendar, Slack, and Notion. These are all places that we are storing information, OK? We have information that passes through Gmail and calendar and Slack and all that crap, but we need to get that stuff indexed into one area, so we put it in the super base. Superbase is just a database that we can store stuff in, OK?

@Trent [25:00]: But some of our data sources are also Google Drive and GitHub. So we've got a bunch of information with code and documents and stuff in GitHub. So what we're, what I'm working on is the interfaces, so things that we, as the humans are going to interact with, are gonna be something like this. So Claude Moil will give us the ability to be able to do querying and voice capture.

@Trent [25:27]: Cloud desktop will give us the ability to query, query, create, notion gives us the ability to view, edit, and create stuff. and then potentially a future custom UI instead of using some of these interfaces, so we'll see how that goes, but I wanna see

@Trent [25:46]: How everything goes together. So here's entity relationships. So we have a client. The client's linked to a deal. The client is also, there's a person, a person is part of a client, a client will have a project. Each project has things like emails related to it, assets, meetings, notes, and tasks, and a calendar event, OK?

@Chris Andrade [26:06]: Yeah I think now This is so cool bro.

@Trent [26:16]: So the idea is that we're going to be able to put all these things in Everything above links to meeting transcripts, note content, email bodies, document content, slack messages, voice memo transcriptions, OK? So we can do searching, semantically, meaning just using your words to to find it.

@Trent [26:40]: So that's kind of like big picture, what I want to build for us. I'm trying to see if there's other diagrams in here that, here's a, I don't want the simplified one.

@Trent [26:57]: But I put this in the One of the ops channels

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [27:03]: Yeah Yeah, I'm gonna take a deep look in that. That looks like exactly what we need. Like Yeah, like putting the pieces together is just like beyond means, like, definitely see the vision.

@Chris Andrade [27:15]: The only thing that I, I Yeah, it's, it's so well done and I, I, it just fireflies, does that need to be, I mean, I guess that ties into Google, right? So it doesn't

@Trent [27:26]: Well Well, the idea, the idea here is that it doesn't matter what the source is, let me find.

@Chris Andrade [27:32]: Right Right

@Trent [27:35]: Well, let me search this Yeah, it'll let me find in page. So Meeting

@Chris Andrade [27:42]: Kelsey's already sending me voice messages. And Yeah,

@Trent [27:52]: OK, so

@Chris Andrade [27:58]: What showed up

@Trent [28:00]: The idea

@Chris Andrade [28:00]: What show I

@Trent [28:02]: The idea would be That After any meeting, we would do something like this. We would be able to funnel that meeting in, whether it be a link or a voicemail, a voice memo or text.

@Trent [28:18]: And then we would process it and we would Process it and we would link it to calendar events, clients, projects, attendees, and generated tasks. Here's a voice memo. Here we go. This is more specific to what we were talking about.

@Chris Andrade [28:35]: Oh, there we go

@Trent [28:35]: So Here's two options. It's, it's proposing, Voice memo flow. The first one is using the clawed mobile voice, so you can just be the cloud, and you can just say all these words, and then it transcribes it live on the app, so you're not actually sending the audio

@Chris Andrade [28:44]: Hm Right

@Trent [28:53]: Into our system It's transcribing it live right there, and then it takes the transcription and it sends it to our our system. So then what happens is it will log it. OK, and then we get processed and put into our database.

@Chris Andrade [29:10]: Hm

@Trent [29:11]: It's linked to some client plus a project, and the embedded just means that it's in the database we can search it. Here's option B is more like what you were just talking about, some sort of dedicated voice app to N8N. So we would record the voice, and then it would have to transcribe it.

@Trent [29:31]: So the voice memo would be sent to Like this is recommending maybe save it to a drive folder, but we can probably make it better than that. And then detects it and then just transcribes it using whisper. And then process it

@Chris Andrade [29:44]: Yeah, Oh, I'm sorry, I was it. If there's a way that I can like all these memos and they keep coming in, and if I have a dedicated Google folder for now, where I can allocate just these voice memos per client.

@Chris Andrade [30:03]: Would it be able to see, oh, there's a new file, and then automatically push it.

@Trent [30:09]: Yeah, that would be the goal. Right now there's, we don't have the workflow or the infrastructure put in place.

@Chris Andrade [30:16]: To to to

@Trent [30:16]: To do that

@Chris Andrade [30:18]: Yeah, I, I mean, would, would, would that be like the MVP option?

@Trent [30:18]: Yeah. Yeah, that's a, that's a good possibility, right? Is that, that, that's kind of what this is saying is to drop it in the Google Drive and then N8N would be monitoring that folder, and then when it detects it, it would automatically transcribe it, process it, and put it where it belongs, extracting the entities and the actions that are related to it.

@Chris Andrade [30:28]: Right. Hm Hm Like It like no joke.

@Chris Andrade [30:45]: That would solve so many of my issues, and then it would be really cool to start seeing how it delegates In building that up as well, but I think that would be a very big benefit for all of us.

@Chris Andrade [31:03]: Cause then I can just keep everybody updated with 2 single actions.

@Trent [31:11]: Yeah, I mean, ideally, right, you would, I mean See here, trying to think of.

@Chris Andrade [31:19]: Because right now what it's like, I, I, I, I set the recording and then either if I'm lucky enough, I can have fireflies, and then I create a new channel, and then just all those recordings getting pushed to that new channel. If there's a way to create, yeah, like what this is proposing just to drive and pull it from there to push, that makes, oh I would be a whole lot easier to separate and all there is is just MP3 files, at the end of the day.

@Trent [31:47]: Yeah, do we need the raw audio because I would consider potentially ditching the audio after the transcription is good.

@Chris Andrade [31:53]: Yeah, I mean, once it gets processed, I don't see why we would need it, we didn't.

@Trent [31:56]: Archive it for some period of time or something, and then after some period of time, get rid of it, because if something happens with the transcript and then you're like, whoa, crap, this transcript came out like garbage. I don't like it, you know, we want to do something different.

@Chris Andrade [32:00]: That I. Right Right.

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [32:11]: You know, like maybe like a 3 day cycle or something.

@Trent [32:14]: Yeah, 30 days is usually a pretty standard thing, but you can say 7 days or 30 days or 90 days.

@Chris Andrade [32:20]: And then another. Another thing that's been popping up like, cause the way I've been doing my notes just in construction alone is voice records, and then I developed so many recordings that I could not go back and actually go through them, but I have them dated, so if something happened, I have my notes, OK, I have my recording systems from this date to this date. OK, it's in this folder. Dude, I got

@Chris Andrade [32:49]: So many recordings with Inspectors, project managers, owners, like, I was like, man, I threw the weight I I fucking just put all my audio into some sort of filtration systems that was something I was gonna start doing on my clod, but, you know, just so much to fucking tackle right now.

@Chris Andrade [33:09]: Because it would be helpful down the road. Oh.

@Trent [33:10]: But So when you're when you're getting these audios, like

@Chris Andrade [33:16]: Mhm

@Trent [33:17]: Is it coming in via like text message on your iPhone or is it coming in like WhatsApp or where?

@Chris Andrade [33:22]: Well, right now it's mainly me. Phone calls right now or if I'm have my mic on my phone or my My my DJI mites and I'm wear on my person.

@Trent [33:36]: Yeah

@Chris Andrade [33:38]: Though mainly that's where all those recordings are from, all those mics recorded from my, my open mic on my DJI.

@Trent [33:47]: Yeah, so I guess what I'm getting at is I was trying to figure out the easiest way that you can take something from a client, let's say you don't have the ability to micke them up, right? So they're gonna send you something like Kelsey, for example, when he sends you an audio recording, what does that come in as?

@Chris Andrade [33:47]: I have Hm. Oh, so like he just sent me one right now, and that came in

@Chris Andrade [34:07]: Let's see, let's see details.

@Trent [34:11]: Was it a text message or WhatsApp, or what is it?

@Chris Andrade [34:13]: Oh weird, it's a file named AMR. I've never seen that

@Trent [34:20]: Are you, are you, are you on Android?

@Chris Andrade [34:22]: Yeah

@Trent [34:23]: OK, that's why

@Chris Andrade [34:26]: What is that? it's so if I had iPhone, it would be different.

@Trent [34:29]: If you had an iPhone, it would come across as a different, it would look different, like, it would look like WhatsApp. You know how WhatsApp has like the little playback. Utility inside. Yeah. It would look like that on iMessage.

@Chris Andrade [34:37]: Yeah. Gotcha So, and that's something that I need to probably consider here is that 90% is our iPhone users, 10% Android, and I'm wanted that 10, and most of our clients are gonna be iPhone, which I do have an iPhone.

@Chris Andrade [34:57]: So I might have to encourage him to send into that line. Let me see how I can manipulate this real quick and then

@Trent [35:05]: Find a way when I'm asking this question, I'm trying to figure out what is the most common way that a one of our clients is going to do, do this for us, right? Send it to us. So if we can find a way to capture You know, most of those Then it, I don't wanna add like, hey, well you have to use our tool, because what's gonna happen is that they're gonna be like, well, I don't want to use your tool, or they're gonna be like, well, I forgot that I was supposed to use your tools, so I text you instead. So,

@Trent [35:36]: We want to try to meet them where they're at if we can.

@Chris Andrade [35:39]: So I, I'm just doing a test real quick. This is, I'm gonna add test, and then I'm gonna say delete. OK, so now I wanna come over here. Did it just get uploaded?

@Chris Andrade [36:02]: I uploaded an audio file, that audio file to our Slack channel. Oh, it's uploading right now.

@Trent [36:12]: So that's also a possibility is that slack will transcribe things. I should also look at our

@Chris Andrade [36:19]: So

@Trent [36:22]: Data retention

@Chris Andrade [36:23]: I mean

@Trent [36:24]: Data retention and slack, I don't think it's permanent. So I need to look at that.

@Chris Andrade [36:30]: Damn That's crazy So that's another reason why you wanna get this built so to keep everything logged, so we have it for reference for eternity.

@Trent [36:47]: Yeah, I mean, we want it so that we can Do a lot more with it and bring it all together into one.

@Chris Andrade [36:49]: Right. Yeah, yeah, if you think about how many hours do we have spent on the slack, but.

@Trent [36:58]: Oh, I know, we, we want to be able to take slack messages and dump them into here. We want to take emails and dump them into here. We want to take me term strips and dump them in.

@Chris Andrade [36:58]: Like Yeah. Yeah.

@Trent [37:07]: So

@Chris Andrade [37:07]: OK

@Trent [37:08]: We want to do all those things I was having a big long conversation. I'm telling you, like, I just scrolled through a bunch and the cursor's right here. See it? OK. So I'm telling you, if you go to this chat, it's a long one, OK?

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [37:27]: OK.

@Trent [37:28]: Go to the bottom Go to the bottom for anything that is latest because I, I went through a couple of iterations on what I'm doing here.

@Chris Andrade [37:30]: Do you want

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [37:35]: Mhm Start at the bottom

@Chris Andrade [37:36]: So Yeah, I think this be

@Trent [37:40]: But I'm, I'm getting ready to do this. And yeah, it has 40 hero because my memory, like all of the clawed stuff is all about 400.

@Chris Andrade [37:47]: We, we, we're all the same, man. We're all each other brands, dude.

@Trent [37:52]: But yeah, so what I have it now is this is a planning document that I'm gonna hand over to Claude Code to help me build out the notion.

@Chris Andrade [37:52]: We're all

@Trent [38:00]: Architecture. So,

@Chris Andrade [38:03]: Awesome Kelsey just texted, he said Qo after I installed it showed up as an option, so that's good.

@Trent [38:12]: Yeah, I, I expected it to because that's its core functionality is being like a business phone replacement.

@Chris Andrade [38:12]: For

@Trent [38:18]: Right

@Chris Andrade [38:19]: Right All I do is well I'll get back to it. I got so much shit to get done over here, but the Kelsey just popped up and I wanted to make sure I, I, I was addressing it properly, so appreciate you guys.

@Trent [38:22]: OK. Yeah Are we gonna be on a call with the guy for today or not?

@Chris Andrade [38:35]: I, I mean, what do you guys wanna do? Do you guys want to do the 3:30 call?

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [38:40]: I thought you couldn't

@Trent [38:44]: Is there, I mean, I don't have a restriction at that time. I mean, I don't want to spend all day on calls. That's the only thing, and you mentioned that too.

@Chris Andrade [38:45]: I That's why. I mean that at the end of the day, I'm, I didn't want, if you guys want to do it or reschedule, it's no big day, honestly, I felt like what happened yesterday with my mom about all their focus on and sales and sales and sales and sales. I have a really big feeling that that's gonna be Mike. He's gonna be like, I need to convert contrast, convert contrast, convert contracts, and then he's not gonna really understand because of the mental state I think he's in.

@Chris Andrade [39:18]: I just, I think that's what we're gonna get out of Mike, if I'm being honest.

@Trent [39:23]: Well, you know, the biggest problem, but I mean, the biggest problem and the most apparent problem to the people that are in the business

@Chris Andrade [39:23]: After all.

@Trent [39:31]: You know, is the biggest problem or the biggest relief that we can provide that particular person, right? Even if it's not core to the root of the cause root of the problem, it's, you know, it's something to be addressed

@Chris Andrade [39:44]: Yeah, which is what again?

@Trent [39:47]: Like sales, right? Close closure, you can't, like just for us, right? Like if, if I were building all these tools and these solutions, and all these other things, but we weren't selling anything, it wouldn't matter, right? So

@Chris Andrade [39:49]: Yeah But what do you guys wanna do? What do you guys, you guys tell me, man.

@Trent [40:06]: I'm I'm

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [40:08]: Do a call if it comes down to it, we'll just like run them through real quick. We'll be, we'll just be like, we'll get back to you and we'll just sit down and listen to him, see what his issues are. Just have a conversation, and then, yeah, I don't.

@Chris Andrade [40:09]: OK Are you OK with that, Trent? Cause I want, I would like to have everybody

@Trent [40:23]: Yeah, Yeah, it'll be 5:30 p.m. my time, 3 3:30ish, right? Your time?

@Chris Andrade [40:29]: Yes, sir Mhm

@Trent [40:30]: Yeah, yeah. It'll be 5:30 over here and I'm fine with that. That's good.

@Chris Andrade [40:35]: OK. And then, well then, I'll, I'll, I'll let him know, and I would like to set an expectation of like, of time on in in the beginning of the meeting, so we all, you know what I mean, for respect wise, you know, I think he would appreciate that too.

@Trent [40:54]: Yeah, I think that if we can try to keep this meeting to one hour would be ideal.

@Chris Andrade [40:59]: Yes, I agree. I agree.

@Trent [41:01]: Like, if it ends up being shorter, fine, but I think a good plan is to try to just try to stick to an hour if we can.

@Chris Andrade [41:04]: Right. 100 or 100 or 100.

@Trent [41:09]: If

@Chris Andrade [41:11]: Yep, all right, I'll, I'll get that teed up and then I'll confirm with you guys here soon.

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [41:12]: And

@Trent [41:16]: OK, sounds good. I'm gonna jump off here, Mikel, if you need anything immediately, let me know, but I got a call in 15 minutes, so.

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [41:22]: No worries. we can just like up later at noon or whatever this afternoon.

@Trent [41:26]: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yup.

@Mekaiel Abdullahi [41:26]: No stress

@Trent [41:29]: Sounds good. All right, see you.

@Chris Andrade [41:30]: Bye. Good morning, Mike I just confirmed with the team. They are available today at 3:30.

@Chris Andrade [41:49]: If you are still
