"We have some really cool things that I really hate that they live on Google Sheets."

Heard this on a call today.

Translation:
→ Valuable IP exists
→ Nobody uses it
→ Friction kills adoption

The fix isn't better spreadsheets.

It's removing the friction entirely.

One pricing tool conversion = tool adoption from 10% to 60%+.

Same value. Different delivery. Completely different outcome.
