Your discovery calls are leaving money on the table.

Here's why:

Most consultants take notes.
Few consultants take systematic action.

THE FRAMEWORK I USE:

1. **Map the Functions** (not just pain points)
   → What does the business actually DO?
   → Where are the handoffs?
   → What's working vs. broken?

2. **Extract Quotes** (not summaries)
   → Client's exact words = their buying language
   → Pain in their voice = priority indicator
   → "Now is the time" = close signal

3. **Score Opportunities** (not wish lists)
   → Impact (1-10)
   → Feasibility (1-10)
   → ROI (1-10)
   → Priority Score = action order

4. **Build the Roadmap** (not proposals)
   → Phase 1: Quick wins ($5-15K)
   → Phase 2: Strategic ($25-50K)
   → Phase 3: Transformation ($50-100K+)

THE RESULT:
Discovery call → Prioritized roadmap in hours, not days.

Client sees exactly where to start and where it leads.
