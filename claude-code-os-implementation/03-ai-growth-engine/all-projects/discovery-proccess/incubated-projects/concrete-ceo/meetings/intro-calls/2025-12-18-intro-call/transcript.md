## Transcript

### Chris Andrade - 00:00

Of like a shell shock to see not only how difficult it was, but how much it cost just to even run the numbers. And then ultimately how the process, from the taking of the plans to the takeoff technician, then to the estimator and then the proposal to get sent out, like really understanding how that whole process works. I started working on some efficiency models, right? And then how do we make that efficient because it was so expensive to run it. And anyways, I started thinking differently and using my background in technology and analytics, I started to see how much a common issue was just in construction alone and how much it was costing the owners and how much overhead it requires just to throw a number on the table. Right.

### Chris Andrade - 01:09

And that led me to Mike Kurek, which got me setting up his systems in his environment for Remus development. Then we shifted to concrete, working with David Novares. And I've been his assistant now since January. And I was learned concrete, I don't know, I never poured concrete, never done concrete. Didn't know how it works. I just know how to build systems and create flows. Right. And that's how I got involved with Remus. And then Mike Kurich saw my potential and he needed systems in place and communication channels and again. And that's where we are. And once the commercial side started slowing down significantly, not just us, we have a lot of other like big dog contractors that are very slow. And it's. That's when back in September, I started coming up with strategies to. Because I saw things and trends happening.

### Chris Andrade - 02:21

And that's when I found you guys. Right? And that is when I. Because our license is geared. When I think, Vince, you know, that we're more geared for commercial work. David Navarros eight hundred linear feet, Thousand linear feet a day, right. You can't really find those jobs in residential, right. So it was a whole other gear shift from commercial to residential. Right. But I come from residential. These guys are all commercial. And I'm like, well, I know residential. I got a lot of connections in residential. That's when I was like, okay. I think after all the research and many interviews, Concrete CEO is the best one for us. You know, ultimately that's when went and started the whole onboarding process, right. And. And it looks like we're missing one other member. He's a very high level.

### Chris Andrade - 03:18

He works for the Air Force and he kind of has, that's his daily job. There are some, he's involved in some high level, like he works with, like he has some. Something to do with the Pentagon.

### Trent Christopher - 03:32

They're Very.

### Chris Andrade - 03:33

I'm unclear about the whole deal but very high level individual. And now you have Trent and Matthew who are a part of. We're all teamed up now. I wrote out a spiel because I'm trying to be to the point and I know your guys time is very valuable and I take that very seriously. Okay. But while I was at Remus, while Remus Development was undergoing the onboarding process, I was working on a project of my own for my parents company. They all, they. I'm from Flagstaff, Arizona. That's where they live. They own a business. They own actually it's growing significantly and I was involved in creating a proprietary software for them. Right. And after I designed it and after that phase was like I fully figured out how this all looks and how it's supposed to work.

### Chris Andrade - 04:29

I needed to move on to the development phase, right. Well, I was struggling to find somebody who actually cared about my project. Right. Because a developer, when you're outsourcing it, they're all about the numbers and you know, so I found this development agency and they are set up to give you the tools by providing you with a community to ultimately help develop whatever it is that you're trying to create. Right. So I took the leap and my first meeting with my new software that I'm creating, I met a group of dudes and on November 26th we solidified that we are all in alignment. Like these guys. We all have the same trajectory, right. We all think the same. We are very clear from minute one and we've been working very hard since November 26th is when we actually solidified this group. I have never.

### Chris Andrade - 05:43

And when I seen they say this, I have never in my life have seen a productivity rate at this caliber. Right? And it's not just me, it's the guys that are ultimately they're the ones who can say what the possibilities are. I have just a customer service obsessed background, right. And that's where my skill set is. Right. Anticipating what customers and clients need now us, were able to build an agency to help businesses find and expose root problems that hinder any businesses potential for growth strategies or just profit margins. Right. At the end of the day there's always ways to improve on any business possible now. While understanding what were developing and what were creating, I wished, I wish that Remus Development undergoed a similar type audit to Concrete CEO's platform.

### Chris Andrade - 06:57

Because trust me when I say this, Concrete CEO, you guys are the best at what you do. Because I have had. I went through four different other interview process from other people that I found to help us generate this marketing model to get us into the residential sector. Right. Because here we are, commercial contractors. I got to convince the commercial contractor to go into the residential sector. Right. The only way I could have done that is with you guys. Right. I'm only capable of so much and I know the power of social media, even though I hate it, but you have to have somebody who ultimately knows it. And when I knew that you were my guy, Tyler, is because I have all her Moses books sitting right over here.

### Chris Andrade - 07:52

And when I saw you and when I was listening to your YouTube channels, you always reference the things that I was listening to. All of the things that I have ultimately what changed my whole life. Because to be honest, back when I started developing the software for my parents, I got the aha moment of actually how to make it work from the Hormosi and Trent, we didn't know this, but when her Mosi launched his hundred million dollar model, were in the launch group together. We didn't even know it, but were there live watching that launch group happen. Right now, all I'm saying is that yes, Remus Development is at fault for its ultimate. Not being able to do what you guys were meant to do. And at the end of the day, it wasn't my fault.

### Chris Andrade - 08:51

Because Mike and Vince, you can contest to what we're dealing with here. He's undergoing some health issues. Right. There's. That's what I call the contingency factors in any proposal life. Right. There's a. Unfortunately, circumstances have dictated our contingency factor for the success of using concrete CEOs platform. Right now I just got a phone call three hours ago saying, hey, you guys just got the contract for Fiesta Gilbert. Yes. Right. It's giving them some Runway. Right. I am trying to keep Remus Development alive. But while I was doing that and building this, I just realized that I wish there was a way that we could have been audited to set Remus Development up for success. Because at the end of the day were. We are not set up properly, if I'm being honest. And it's. It's not the lack of we don't give a.

### Chris Andrade - 10:02

It's just honestly, we didn't know what we don't know. Right. And with your experience in concrete alone. Right. I had to take this opportunity to introduce you to not only me, but the team and that's why I called you here. So I'm going to turn it over. I'm going to introduce you Guys. To Trent and Matthew and say hello.

### Trent Christopher - 10:28

Hey guys. I know that, I know we didn't have a chance to say hi, but here we are now, so. But yeah, my name's Trent. I have been a controls engineer for 22 years industrial automation. So doing physical automation has been my thing for a really long time. Cut my teeth in manufacturing plan at Honda and it's been quite the journey for me, to be honest. But I've had many different facets where I've had a system integration small business, then a machine builder larger business, both small businesses, I mean small to medium business. I think the machine builder was like a $30 million a year revenue and then moved to a multi billion dollar corporation, Omron Electronics for six years, all as an engineer.

### Trent Christopher - 11:16

But I came into the group that Chris was talking about because I just wanted to build cool stuff for my business. So I started this business in January 4.0 Hero focused on industrial automation and I wanted to be able to automate my processes internal to my business, plus build cooler stuff. So I was like, okay, how can I do that? So that's kind of what led me to meeting Chris and this same AI accelerator, that group that we're in. So. But that's me.

### Tyler Link - 11:52

Cool. Good to meet you. Nice to meet you.

### Matthew Kerns - 11:56

And my name is Matthew. So I, I'm 31, I, I out of college. I started working for Amazon as a software development engineer. So I learned quite a bit from people a lot smarter than me once I joined that company about professional software development. For several years before I got promoted to the next level I was trusted to work on some bigger projects and manage some developers underneath me. So we worked on the App Store for Fire Tablets team. So that was a lot of Android development and making sure we connect with aws. We did some migration to AWS over that time and then the last team that I was on there for the last couple years was Alexa for apps. So working on Alexa and the interface between voice enabling the apps in the buyer ecosystem.

### Matthew Kerns - 13:10

So I did that and then I was thinking like I like working at a big company and learning, but I think there's a higher ceiling somewhere in entrepreneurship. So about three and a half years ago I left to start my own e commerce company and for whatever reason I thought it was going to be, I thought I was going to knock it out of the park by myself without a team. And I learned my lesson over time. So part of that like that whole learning process is what led me to this group and Just being super open to partnering up and just we can move so much faster when we work together. So also I wanted to make sure that I automate and audit that business and make sure that basically all the systems and processes are in place.

### Matthew Kerns - 14:03

And you know, before automating anything, we need to have like SOPs. So that's a bit about my background. But yeah, coming together and meeting these guys has just been incredible and I think we can really bring a lot of value to good businesses. So yeah, great. It's great to meet all of you guys and I hope we can figure out that we can work together.

### Trent Christopher - 14:29

Yeah, thanks Matthew, Appreciate that.

### Tyler Link - 14:31

It's nice to meet you.

### Matthew Kerns - 14:33

Yeah, yeah, you guys too.

### Tyler Link - 14:35

I think Chris is trying to talk.

### Trent Christopher - 14:36

But you're trying to meet.

### Tyler Link - 14:37

Just so you know.

### Chris Andrade - 14:41

Can you touch on Mikhail's experience for just a second? Trent?

### Trent Christopher - 14:47

Yeah, I mean I can touch on it. So Mikel, he, I think he joined the Air Force like pretty much right out of university or maybe right out of high school. I don't really remember exactly when he joined, but he was stationed in Ramstein, I guess, and he was spending some time there supporting there. He's a systems engineer working in the security. So he was working on working the security back end systems for the Pentagon and the Department of Defense and supporting that air base over at Ramstein. So I know he was doing that and then now I think he actually does some contracting work in the same, at the same level. So. But that's pretty much what he's focused on. But I know he's still doing that and then he's helping us build this as well.

### Matthew Kerns - 15:36

Yeah, I can add a little bit too. He. So Ramstein is in Germany for anyone who doesn't know. And then also he, right now he does the contract work for MIT Research Labs. I met him like maybe a month ago and he was the first person I met in the accelerator who's just like the same level of bought in as me. And we were just getting on calls every single day, like morning and night and just working through the program and just like that dude is like high level. So just wanted to mention that because I think he's awesome.

### Trent Christopher - 16:12

Yeah, sorry, I was just gonna say something. Chris. So I think one of the things, one of the reasons why we actually were here, I know that, you know, you guys are busy fellas as well, trying to figure out how to, you know, operate your business. But I think what were realizing talking to Chris was that there's all sorts of different businesses that need help. And that's really what we're trying to do. We're trying to build some cool stuff and help some businesses and help. Help people out. And we think you guys are doing the exact same thing. And we have alignment and we saw some opportunities that we might be able to. To help you guys on or to work together on. Right. And we felt like if nothing else, we wouldn't be doing you any.

### Trent Christopher - 16:57

We'd be doing a disservice by not at least, you know, acknowledging that and coming and talking to you guys to see what we could work out, see if there's anything we can help with.

### Chris Andrade - 17:07

And to be honest, Mr. Tyler and Vince, you know, we've had the conversations and I, I heard you about your trip out there to Dallas and you saw the convention and you had your. You this, the big AI stuffing. And I, I. To be honest, this is the first time I've really put myself out there. And so my humility factors at a high, but I can't go on every day knowing that I had access to you. Mr. Link and I had to. I know we have value. I know that my job is to try to prove it. And Mr. Trent, he knows the Hermercy playbook better than everybody else. And that's why we just all think alike, gentlemen. And I feel like we.

### Chris Andrade - 17:55

I had to at least see if there was a way, like, if I use Remus Development as like a secret shopper experience. Right. And I saw some things that I think we could enhance, but make the client of concrete CEO's experience ultimately better, but help the contractors understand their businesses better at the same time. And that's where I'm kind of trying to figure out an alignment between us. If we can work with you guys to help audit these contractors in a way, obviously, Tyler, that you are aligned with. We just want to try to support your guys's clients success through the program. Right. Ultimately, at the end of the day, I know you guys are building your AI systems and you guys are all. And they're all proprietary to you. And we will definitely. Whatever we need to do to honor that.

### Chris Andrade - 19:02

I'm just trying to see how can we just. I just honestly just have a conversation at the end of the day.

### Trent Christopher - 19:09

Yeah, that's why we're here.

### Chris Andrade - 19:11

Sorry.

### Trent Christopher - 19:11

Conversation.

### Tyler Link - 19:12

Okay. Yeah, no, I appreciate you guys reaching out. I mean, yeah, I will say, I mean, I'd be the first to, you know, admit that's like one of our biggest things that we're actually working on as a company. I actually. Eric is relatively new to concrete CEO, and so that was part of the reason why he got brought on, you know, And Vince is my brother, and he knows what it's like to be a contractor. But now we're working on, obviously, I don't know, like, what it's like to kind of, like, bridge that gap. And it is kind of hard because it's like, part coach and part, like, servant in a way. And it's not so simple because even a lot of times what people want to do is actually the wrong thing. And so it's like, you know, how do you.

### Tyler Link - 19:55

How do you bridge that gap? And then, you know, how do you. How do you do something like an audit, for instance, while keeping people's engagement? Because, I mean, it's like, you know, Chris, you know, it's like people like Mike or people like that, they're just. They're so fast paced. How do you. There's sometimes I just want to shake a contractor, like, dude, chill. Like, you're taking this afternoon off, and we're gonna solve problems. And so we've been constantly struggling with stuff like that, and we're making strides. And, you know, I own my own concrete business, so it's like, it's more my slow season. So, like, that's like our name of the game over the next three months is just trying to, you know, perfect that at least more so than what we can.

### Tyler Link - 20:38

And there is a balance of, like, how much we could do because there's so many cool things we could do. But it requires time and, like, our clients time, you know, especially contractors, for whatever reason, they think that the only thing they could be doing is, like, running around solving a fire in the field right now. And I'm like, dude, like it. And so it's. It's exceptionally hard, I feel like, for blue collar, which I also get it because I came from that I still. It's like, there's so much stuff that pops up. So.

### Tyler Link - 21:07

Long story short, I'm interested to at least hear what you guys have to say. It is a big focus of ours moving forward. I think, like, how you onboard is like, you know, Hermosi talks about it all the time. It's like, that's. That's how you set the precedent for the relationship. And it's also how you, like, solve a lot of problems. Not allowing people to do stupid things, not turning on leads, and people don't understand you have to call them right away. It's like there's so many things that there's a lot. So yeah, I guess like did you guys have something in mind then? And you guys are software developers obviously so you wanted to help bridge the gap with software. I mean, what did you guys have in mind from a high level viewpoint?

### Trent Christopher - 21:47

Yeah. So I mean the way that we help people, the way that we intend on operating as an agency is trying to transform companies, trying to transform businesses into, you know, doing more with less technology. And AI is at the core of that. We are AI native, so everything that we're doing, we are leveraging AI in every possible way that we could potentially explore so that we can make sure that we get a better outcome. Right. And I don't think we knew what were actually going to build along the way. We just knew were going to start figuring out our processes and how we would onboard clients and what we've discovered by going through some of this and through some trial and error and we're still building it by the.

### Chris Andrade - 22:26

Way, I'm not yesterday I just wanted to throw that in there with this model and that's just so, you know, I want to throw that in there.

### Trent Christopher - 22:35

Yeah. So what we've been able to do is leverage AI in a way to be able to accelerate this audit process and in some ways in a passive way. So we didn't really know that this is how were going to do it, but just through some meeting transcription. Using meeting transcription and asking the right questions, we're able to extract many different details about the business, potential opportunities, gaps that we can help identify the biggest problems for the business. So things like we created an opportunity canvas and an opportunity matrix that we can basically develop just from that conversation.

### Trent Christopher - 23:16

And what we're looking at trying to do going forward is to continue to refine this so that we can make it even better and more improved with the outcome and the output that we get and try to turn it into something that is a really refined format we can hand over and guide our clients along the way of, you know, where are you at now and where do you need to be? And I think that what Chris is really trying to propose is that he realized that there was a gap between what Remus development, where they were and where they needed to be to truly adopt your systems. Right. And in that gap is kind of accidentally what we're creating. So we're trying to find a way that we can do this at a very rapid pace.

### Chris Andrade - 24:06

Okay. So we're still working out processes and procedures. And to be honest, Tyler, we me anticipated to make you a believer. Right. I wasn't anticipating you being here, so I'm honored again. Right. But if we need to convince you, then let us run our audit process through you. Right? Let's. Let's do like. Let's, like, if you want to really see how we work, right. Put us through the paces. Right. Let us roll out our. Our onboarding process. Right. Ultimately, it's going to help us one way or the other. Right. And then you can kind of see, like, maybe we should do this here. Because my thought process was after we signed our contract on October 10, right. From October 10 to October 29, we had this time from the Facebook being built to the website being created. Right.

### Chris Andrade - 25:05

There wasn't a whole lot of interaction between us and you between that time frame. And I was thinking, well, damn, if, okay, now we initiated the Facebook, we initiated the website. Now we're waiting for those processes to kind of fulfill on their end with Adrian and your guys's team. Right. Well, then what's to say in that gap of time, what if you had some sort of program to do an audit for also the contractor? I mean, really, in all honesty, it's not crazy, time consuming. It's just literally answering questions, recording him and, like, coming like. It's like a process. Right. Why couldn't we incorporate that process in that first onboarding phase somehow? Like, and. And then by the time the systems were integrated and active, we already know how we're going to roll it out into the market. Right. We have developed.

### Chris Andrade - 26:10

We helped the contractor develop a plan to execute once the ad space is ready to be pushed, you know, And I. That's where I'm like, that's where I saw some opportunity just at the surface and really ultimately for you to kind of see if that's something that you would think is needed or help with.

### Tyler Link - 26:35

Yeah. And Vince, did you offer, by the way, know your numbers to Remus by chance?

### Chris Andrade - 26:41

Yes.

### Tyler Link - 26:42

Remus never took advantage of it, right. If I remember right.

### Chris Andrade - 26:46

Yes. Correct. Yeah. And to be honest, again, it didn't know your numbers is on Mike and Zurich's part because I have access to the bank. Right?

### Matthew Kerns - 27:00

Yeah.

### Chris Andrade - 27:00

I'm an authorized signer for Remus Development. But at the end of the day, Mike Kasurich is the responsible party here. Right. And because, to be honest, Vince or Tyler, I haven't gotten paid since 10-10-actually was my last legit paycheck. So I. It's not like I had a bunch of free time to like go through that process for them because I ultimately had to figure out some other. Oh, Mikhail jumped in. Hey Mikhail.

### Mekaiel Abdullahi - 27:38

Hey, how's it going guys?

### Chris Andrade - 27:40

Good, good.

### Tyler Link - 27:41

How are you?

### Chris Andrade - 27:42

Introduction to you, but say hi.

### Matthew Kerns - 27:44

Hey, how's it going everyone?

### Mekaiel Abdullahi - 27:45

My name is Mika. Apologies for being right late. Just a little bit about my background.

### Matthew Kerns - 27:50

I don't know where you guys are.

### Mekaiel Abdullahi - 27:51

In the conversation, but 30 years old, living in Washington D.C. started information technology about like 10 years ago working in the Air Force and then over here at the Pentagon and did some work for the Department of State. Brought together, met these guys in a neat group of entrepreneurs forming an agency, starting a transformation partnership for small service businesses and small and medium service sized businesses to help solve issues where engineering as a service. And we just. Chris told me a lot about you guys this morning in our morning break and we'd love to hear how we can help you guys out.

### Chris Andrade - 28:31

So Tyler, now hearing that now you mean Mikhail, like I mean at the end of the day, what's your thoughts? Like how are you thinking, if any, like what's your initial reaction there?

### Mekaiel Abdullahi - 28:42

I would just like to listen, honestly. You guys are the expert in your guys's field.

### Mekaiel Abdullahi - 28:48

Main process is to just identify some of the problems that you guys.

### Chris Andrade - 28:52

Oh, I think Tyler was gonna. Or I was just in that to Tyler. Sorry.

### Tyler Link - 28:56

No, it's fine. I mean, like I was saying before, I mean I think that's like my constant struggle from the agency perspective is like knowing what's best for people and actually getting them to do it. I mean Remus being a, a good example. It's like, you know, we're not software developers by any stretch of the imagination. We have like random things like we have a little audit process. Right. Ideally what we do is we take people through a like pro forma, like P and L statement type of deal where we grab out like their admin wages, their indirect wages, their overhead. And by the way, we actually build this for people. And it still blows my mind that people don't do it. We just need their, like their profit and loss statement.

### Tyler Link - 29:36

We go through, we build out their workforce, we go through, build up their labor burden, subcontractors. And then basically like it's a lot more complex. But like long story short, what it does is it spits out a P and L and that's like what we do with this is that's how it helps us determine like hey, how many leads do we need what should our close rate be? Like, what are our, like, success criteria? Like, even a lot of people, when they get into residential, like, Remus, they don't necessarily know the charge. So we could figure out, hey, if you charge a certain amount, you know, like, you can make a lot more money with your same exact people, but you have to know how to sell it. It's like, you know, so there's so many things.

### Tyler Link - 30:14

But the hard part is we're constantly battling. We're constantly battling things that we know, like an audit process that we could take someone through to be helpful and selling it. Because, like, keep in mind, when people hire concrete CEO, like, they say, I want leads. And in reality, they don't even realize that their business is broke. And so it's like. And sometimes it's like, well, even if you do determine that their business is broke, it's like, then what? It's like, do we just throw in the towel? It's like, they're like, oh, well, I need you to do everything. It's like, oh, yeah, I'm gonna just fix your entire business for 2,500 bucks a month.

### Mekaiel Abdullahi - 30:48

Right.

### Tyler Link - 30:48

It's like, it's super impossible. And so we're like. I would say, like, where we go is we. It's just very difficult to balance, like, the audit and, like, not trying to overwhelm people. And, you know, Remus is actually, like, a good company compared to a lot of contractors.

### Mekaiel Abdullahi - 31:09

Right.

### Tyler Link - 31:09

A lot of contractors have no support. Like, think about, like, they're in the field, so when they do their onboarding call, they're, like, in their truck.

### Trent Christopher - 31:16

It's like.

### Tyler Link - 31:18

Which, again, like, I get it. That's just the field. So I think that's where my head goes, is like, how do we balance that? Yeah. So, I mean, a visual, like something like this. Yeah. Let's take a look.

### Trent Christopher - 31:31

Yeah. So what we're able to do just through it, like, in some ways, this happened by accident.

### Mekaiel Abdullahi - 31:37

Okay.

### Trent Christopher - 31:38

Where we didn't actually go into an interview with the intention to create what we have. And this isn't necessarily the final form of what we would give to somebody, but it helps us through our analysis to make sure that we understand the business as much as we. At least as much as we can extract from a single conversation. Right. So.

### Chris Andrade - 32:00

To be precise.

### Trent Christopher - 32:03

Yeah. So what we've done is we broke it down between the acquisition engine and the delivery engine, the support engine. Okay. And through a transcript process. Okay. We actually have a dialogue.

### Mekaiel Abdullahi - 32:15

Okay.

### Trent Christopher - 32:16

That happened between our client here with Chris and Kelsey and there were also some other people that were present as well in some of the conversation. We're able to break it up into all these conversations and the topics themselves. And once we break it up into topics, what we can do is we can take that and we can pull out all of the opportunities, the issues that are occurring in the business, the things that they mentioned, the wording that they use, we can extract all of that. And then what we can do is identify opportunities. And that's where these types of things come into play. This right here is grouped a little differently. This is about the daily workflow. So the business owner's daily workflow here and where he is the bottleneck, it helps us identify that he's the bottleneck.

### Trent Christopher - 33:04

We've got things like the other processes that were identified in the conversation.

### Trent Christopher - 33:11

But ultimately one of the things that we really try to work towards is creating this matrix here that helps us identify the way that we're going to, we intend on trying to help them. We try to aim for where is the lowest effort, highest value solution that we can try to put into place.

### Trent Christopher - 33:40

There's something that's broken, as you mentioned. There's always something broken in the business. I know that my business is broken. You guys know that there's somewhere that you would like to see improvement too? Of course. Yeah, yeah. So what we're trying to do is we're trying to find the most passive, fastest way to identify these issues. And, and the way it's not the issue that we need to identify, it's really how can we help. Right. The lowest, the lowest effort, highest value opportunity to improve their business. So that's kind of what we are trying to work towards here. So we kind of sort of accidentally fell into it, knew we needed to have these steps. But as far as building the process and how quickly we can do this has been really mind boggling to us as a group.

### Trent Christopher - 34:30

Even though we knew what was possible.

### Trent Christopher - 34:33

But anyway it, what we're trying to allude to here is that we kind of did this by accident and we want to do it with intention. So having people that understand the business, a particular niche is absolutely helpful to be able to identify these things even more refined.

### Tyler Link - 34:56

Yeah, yeah. There's so many things like I saw you guys said, like, there's like the vicious pricing cycle that I saw you guys have on there. It's like lead response time. I mean, it's like, I mean like simple things. It's like, we could ask a question during onboarding. It's like, what's your email list look like? And we should be able to generate leads, like, today if we get that, you know, into a reactivation campaign. There's about, like a million things it's about. So, yeah, I like the concept of it. And I do like the concept of it. Yeah.

### Chris Andrade - 35:31

When I had my first initial meeting with Robbie, October 2nd, right, I pulled up the transcript off that meeting, and I was kind of dumbfounded. I was like, God, man, Mike told us his whole freaking life story in this thing. And not only Mike, but so did I. And I was like, yeah, now knowing what we know now, I was like, man, do you.

### Trent Christopher - 35:53

Did you.

### Chris Andrade - 35:53

Did you guys have that recording? Like, did you guys have that instance of. Of onboarding?

### Tyler Link - 36:01

No.

### Chris Andrade - 36:02

Okay, because let's say if we did, right? That's so much information from that one phone call, right? And yes, it only supposed to last 15 minutes, but I think I took 30 minutes of Robbie's time, and then I'm looking at the transcript and I was like, damn, Mike told me, damn, he's never said that to me before, or I didn't know it's about Mike. And I was like, so he told Mike, or he told Robbie some things that I didn't know, but because Robbie asked the questions, it gave Mike ant to answer. And I was like, damn, like, this is exactly what we're saying. Like, now knowing how powerful an audio transcript is, I was like, man, if we only had this to build Tyler, maybe a customer profile portfolio that only you guys have access to ultimately understand your clients better, right?

### Chris Andrade - 36:53

And then we can feed that original transcript from the time that they're going to onboard or sell into his profile. We already have information about how these guys are, where they come from, like all of the good stuff for the client. Then we can develop your matrix off of that to ultimately help anticipate them on the next call when they go to sign for the paperwork, you know, or to get that going, you know.

### Mekaiel Abdullahi - 37:25

Sorry to interrupt. The reason why we do it that way is an audit process, essentially, like you guys are familiar with, is because there's so many issues. And the opportunity matrix helps us identify which ones are most immediate to the client and the customer. Because ideally, we. We as developers come from the background. We want to build it, we want to do it, we want to just spin it up. But if it's not useful, if it's not generating ROI at the end of the day, it doesn't matter for us or our clients. Right. And what we're playing around with right now with, you know, just a few spin ups that we're doing is how we want to approach that angle.

### Mekaiel Abdullahi - 37:57

We know we need to partner with the client in order to identify the pain points, but it's just how we want to do it. And the way we like to do it is in phased approaches like you guys are familiar with, you have to. Documentation is something we're learning is very important. Before you even think about Gen AI and automating anything, you kind of have to first know what you're doing, understand what you're doing, have it documented so it's replicable, and then send it off to development in order to do that. So I don't know if you guys have discussed that or where you guys are in that and some of the pain points.

### Mekaiel Abdullahi - 38:30

I know we have some of your transcripts and stuff, but I just want to identify like the main phased approach of it and using the building blocks and building one part on the.

### Chris Andrade - 38:41

Other, you know, And I just want to contest to something, Tyler, that let's say during that onboarding call initially, and then we find out that we don't really have any documentation or SOPs on how to even make a sale. Go from the call initiated to the proposal generated. Like Mike didn't know how the phone was going to answer, who was going to answer it, where it was going to go, how it was going to get. Like none of that. Right? That's where we're, that's like. Because there's no operating procedures and the people that we're talking to building this out, most of them don't even know or what their SOPs when they were updated or if they even have any. Right. So we're finding that just documenting the process and starting at the very base level helps elite like open opportunity.

### Chris Andrade - 39:32

So let's say that you had some sort of package on top of the concrete CEO package to say, hey, what are your administrative like how does that look like? You know, you know what questions to ask ultimately hone into the big problem. Right. But, oh well, we have this other program that helps build these systems. I guarantee that if you would have put a number to that, it would have made Mike be like, huh, I actually, I know I need that, but I don't have the manpower or am I going to have to hire another $120,000 employee a year to build it out and that's going to take months, you know.

### Chris Andrade - 40:12

Well, if you offer a package for an additional 5,000 or whatever, we can build your systems for you know, and that's where these upsell opportunities I feel is where we can help you guys with.

### Tyler Link - 40:29

So how would you guys do that?

### Mekaiel Abdullahi - 40:32

Like we have our process. Ideally it's just a conversation identifying what your biggest pain points are. Once we identify those, it's on us and you guys to go back, identify some quick wins as we like to say. There's going to be smaller like based on the opportunity matrix, there's going to be smaller pushes and bigger pushes. But you want to just know what your goals are and align with that. Right. And once we do that we'll have a proposal, we'll come back, see if that aligns and if we're aligned we bring you on and we like to operate in sprints, essentially identify deliverables, come up with the price proposal, get the contract signed and then go deliver.

### Mekaiel Abdullahi - 41:15

And we don't move on to the next phase without delivering or just so you guys are good and we're good and like we said we're, we're a startup. We're starting off ourselves. I think right now is the best time to you know, do business with this because essentially like everyone's going to have these issues and it's just on us to kind of help and support that. So we're learning along the way and we would appreciate it, you know, to help you guys out. We definitely feel like we could add value to your guys business and then.

### Matthew Kerns - 41:42

So how we deliver also. So me and Trent both have a significant development experience and we will be building most of the things and then as we scale we also have access to the accelerator program and there's so many developers in our network that we can also leverage to help scale operations. And I think at some point both me and Trent will move more into the overseeing projects role and we'll be overseeing the projects and the developers will be, we will get their costs and we'll work with them to essentially deliver more projects at a time. So we're still figuring that part out.

### Chris Andrade - 42:34

But that's at the end of the day. We were talking amongst the group and we honestly don't know how this is going to work with you guys. That's why we want to just to have a conversation for you to determine how do you think we can work with you. We know we need the experience, we know we can deliver. We just need the gym to put our reps in. Right. And like for instance, I see your guys as concrete CEO app, right? And I see this beautiful dashboard, right? And I see all of these wonderful stats like this new. Like, is this AI agent new, by the way? Because I see now you can set up a voice AI system, right?

### Chris Andrade - 43:20

That's where I feel like that's something that we can help with, is make sure, like, do you guys have like a way to walk your clients through these to understand what this app really does and how to use it? You know, like. Like, is there some opportunity that is.

### Tyler Link - 43:40

Just go high level? It's just a white labeled go high level. Which I'm sure you guys probably knew that. Yeah. So we're not developers by any stretch of the imagination. We're just leveraging a tool that we find helpful in our business that we could build tools in that like, can like quickly deploy for clients, which is cool. Yeah, no, I'm. I'm interested. I mean, I didn't really know what to expect from the call. I mean, because, Chris, you had feedback. I mean, and we are getting ready to really revamp our onboarding process. So now is the time that I would potentially be interested in something like this. I feel like I just need a second to kind of process because you guys are basically offering. It's like voice transcribing services that would then document with AI, for instance, quick wins.

### Tyler Link - 44:28

Or maybe we could have bullet points that we pull from sales calls that would help us have more data during onboarding, for instance. It sounds like there's like a lot of potential possibilities. So what would be like the next. The next step?

### Mekaiel Abdullahi - 44:43

We would just go through. I don't know how detailed Chris got it. We would like to set up a recall just like a discovery call, just to make sure we have all of our ducks in a row. And then we'll take that transcript, put that into a proposal. If it makes sense and if it's aligned and the numbers are hit, we could just go from there.

### Chris Andrade - 45:02

Yeah.

### Tyler Link - 45:02

Okay. And then are you guys proposing to like, build the tool that we then leverage or are you proposing that we partner and then you guys were going to build the tool and we sold your guys's services.

### Trent Christopher - 45:13

So let's. I think that maybe I'm going to take a step back here and just try to see if we can paint a better picture of what we do as a. An agency. Is that what we do is we try to. We're engineering as a service, so really what we can do, we have full stack capabilities, but we're trying to implement tools of technology to solve Business problems. So we leverage AI and we help implement AI as well where it makes.

### Trent Christopher - 45:38

Sense, because AI doesn't always make sense.

### Chris Andrade - 45:41

So.

### Trent Christopher - 45:41

Yeah, go ahead, Chris.

### Chris Andrade - 45:43

So, and we're like for the client that we just signed on yesterday, our very first one, which is what we developed this rollout onboarding process for. What we're trying to say is, Tyler, is that if you need your own proprietary software to represent concrete CEO, right, at the end of the day you're trying to build your own intellectual property. We're just here to support you to that goal. And then we just want to help you get there A that makes us work. But then you're going to need to somebody to manage it, right? Or to show your team how to manager. Like you're going to need to have that capability not only for scalability but for usability, right. To make sure that if something's broke, well, who are you going to know to fix it?

### Chris Andrade - 46:33

Well, that's where the arise group comes in and we're just here to support not only you grow, but also let's help your clients success rates grow too, right? And that's where, I mean, I think would be agitation for you is like at the same time you're using us to build out your own proprietary systems. And that's where I think you can separate yourself from the other guys, right? Because yes, I thought this was your proprietary and I'm not a tech guy, dude. I, I am a nerd. I am not a developer, right? So I, I thought when I saw this app I was like, damn, they already created on that. I didn't, I don't know what white label is. I think these guys do, but.

### Chris Andrade - 47:19

I know, but I was like, okay, yeah, like the value of what I was like, we're only paying 2500 for this, right? I was like, damn, this is really good. What if you actually made your own app? Right.

### Trent Christopher - 47:34

So, yeah, so I'll pump the brakes on that just a little bit, Chris, because I know you get excited, right? I don't get the impression that's what you guys are trying to do, but it is a possibility. Right? But what we have the ability to do is to be able to build a full stack piece of software for you, but that's not necessarily the first thing that you jump into, right? So you know, go high level has lots of ways that you can integrate with it. So if it has feature sets that you don't have available to you, then we can tack on features to it, I guess is what I'M proposing as well. Not saying that we have to. I'm just saying that it's a possibility that we can add all these differentiating features that are surrounding and connecting to.

### Trent Christopher - 48:24

What you currently use.

### Trent Christopher - 48:26

It doesn't have totally rip and replace a situation. Right.

### Tyler Link - 48:30

Yeah. Which you know, to be fair, there are like, let me give some time to kind of think about like what you're just talking about. I'm there. There are like random tools that we have that are like really freaking dope. At least I think so from a concrete standpoint. But like they're way too scary from a client standpoint. Right. It's like how do we operationalize the way that someone prices their jobs? So we have to have all these like matrixes. It's like how do we get like productivity increases from the level of access that we have from how much work we do and then how do we turn all of that into an input sheet? And it's like, man, it would just look so much more sexy to have like a login.

### Tyler Link - 49:08

What I mean, so there's like, there is opportunity that we have some really cool things that I really hate that they live on Google sheets because to me they're good enough to warrant like having like a little like a micro SaaS.

### Chris Andrade - 49:21

Yeah.

### Tyler Link - 49:22

Yeah. I mean I'm not, I'm definitely not trying to scale a SaaS company though.

### Chris Andrade - 49:25

At the same time.

### Tyler Link - 49:26

So I'm interested. But it's not like necessarily like our business model per se, so obviously if we did do something, I'd start like pretty small to get. Yeah.

### Trent Christopher - 49:41

Didn't mean to interject or over talk over you. That's actually how we approach it as well. We know that we have to build trust, so we typically go with a quick win sprint in the very beginning just so that we can prove out something that has a small deliverable that we can deliver in a reasonable time frame. Right. And then after we get that, we hope that you want to continue doing business with us so that we can prove that we've actually provided you value, hopefully above and beyond what we've even, you know, promised and then go from there is really kind of the way that we like to work, to be honest. Right.

### Trent Christopher - 50:18

Right now we know, we understand that we are getting started in this, but I feel like we have a pretty good set of skills that we're still trying to tie together on what our processes are. But we understand that it's a, it can be risky to go in with A big play, you know, a big.

### Trent Christopher - 50:36

Agreement with a big number on it.

### Trent Christopher - 50:38

Is, is scary and it's too much risk.

### Mekaiel Abdullahi - 50:41

Ideally just paint a picture like just what the Trump was saying, how we want to paint the pictures essentially after these first few projects and when we nail our processes down, the big picture is to go in, partner up with these businesses and really just partner up and have them not just tell us what to build, but we are gonna do our due diligence to make sense that it makes sense for them in their business. So we don't wanna just end up being developers and just like, hey, yeah, we'll go build whatever you need. It's more like, does it make sense? Why are we building it? Matthew asks me all the time, why are we doing this? And we really want to just identify what the key pain points are to simplify, for simplicity. Time to go. Yeah.

### Trent Christopher - 51:25

Transformation partner is the way that we're describing it.

### Tyler Link - 51:30

No, I'm definitely, I'm definitely, I'm interested. So at least like. Yeah, I would at least be interested to see. So that's what you guys recommend is doing like that quick Win Sprint implementation. Because you guys have built it to get like an idea. Just so I even know too. I mean, I've never hired a developer. I mean like, just so I'm not wasting your guys's time. Like what's like a starting development project look like as far as an investment.

### Trent Christopher - 52:00

What do we determine?

### Chris Andrade - 52:01

Guys.

### Mekaiel Abdullahi - 52:04

It really depends on the deliverables, right? Like what?

### Tyler Link - 52:07

Like that quick wind sprint, for instance.

### Trent Christopher - 52:09

I think our target would probably be around 10,000, so we'd probably try to stick in that ballpark. That way that we don't have, we don't take on too much. Right. And then we can also get you.

### Chris Andrade - 52:19

Quick value and then.

### Tyler Link - 52:23

Okay, and then say like on a bigger project. I don't even know, I don't even know how big a project would be like this. But to turn something like this Google Sheet into an app, I'm just like super curious. Like instead of having all the inputs like live here, where it's just like way quicker. Just you guys know, because I know you said like, instead of just like building something, what's the need right now? There's currently no way for a concrete guy to price a concrete project on site that like takes into account all of the different things at least that we consider to be important, which is basically access. And instead of just saying like square foot, like for instance, Chris at Remus, it's like square foot. They're like, well what does that mean? It's like am I going to be demoing things?

### Tyler Link - 53:01

Do I have like drive up access? Do I have miniscule access? Do I have hand access? Like it, you know, how thick is the concrete gonna be? Like say to turn a sheet like this into an app? I'm just curious like how much? Just roughly. Obviously I know you guys have no idea like really rough range. It, it would be crazy.

### Mekaiel Abdullahi - 53:19

To even give enough just me personally trying to feel different. Just it'd be crazy to give a number based to. I could look at this, say a number, right. But then without an evaluation phase of really understanding what you want end of the day and understanding what that entails from a development aspect, it would, I could give you a number but it's not going to be, you know what I mean?

### Tyler Link - 53:40

Just give it to me.

### Chris Andrade - 53:40

Yeah, yeah.

### Trent Christopher - 53:44

So the like long term, like more long term. When you get into those longer projects, the way that we approach it is we set deliverables and we deliver them and then we move on to the next iteration. So we like to do it in an agile way because there are things that we don't know about your business, we don't know about the things that you're doing, the processes. And even if you sit here and we spend an hour going over it, there are going to be things that we discover that aren't going to be what we thought they were in the very first conversation. So we have to make sure we stay agile.

### Trent Christopher - 54:19

So we can't, we don't want to because we think it's a disservice to us and unfair to you as well to tell you that it's going to take 10 months and a hundred thousand dollars to be able to create that for you because there's a lot of things that can happen along the way. So we tend to do it in smaller chunks and adapt along the way.

### Mekaiel Abdullahi - 54:39

Also something you could possibly do is do like a consulting or auditing phase to identify that and then deliver that to you exactly like what it's going to entail. And then you could hire us or you could do it yourself or go hire a different vendor to do that as well.

### Trent Christopher - 54:55

Yeah, so I mean that's, I, I've been on large projects before and that we have and not for the software development side of things, but my industrial.

### Trent Christopher - 55:07

Automation projects that have been multi million.

### Trent Christopher - 55:10

Dollar projects and they try to quote them and propose them, but at the.

### Trent Christopher - 55:13

End of the Day.

### Trent Christopher - 55:14

It's like you're, you're throwing darts at a lot of things. Right? A lot of different dartboards to try to figure it out.

### Tyler Link - 55:23

I'm just going to be like a quick litmus to see like. Because obviously just to decide. It's kind of like if someone reaches out to me and they say, oh, how much is it going to cost for a foundation? Like, like oh, well, obviously it just is.

### Mekaiel Abdullahi - 55:35

It depends.

### Tyler Link - 55:35

That's why they're structural engineered plans. It's like they have to like check your soil and there's all kinds of stuff. But then I'm like, hey, it could between 10 and 100. And I'm sure like for you guys it's like a evening even wider range obviously because it's totally custom. It's just, you know, I wasn't really planning on having a conversation similar to this before. Like to me it's like man, you know, does it even make sense to kind of like dive in? But it is a good time. Like I said, we are evaluating like some of our systems and procedures as a company and how to make our onboarding process better. For instance, I'm super big into tools because I feel like that's like I love one time investments that I can then leverage to make value.

### Tyler Link - 56:17

Especially with other stuff that like hasn't been made before. Which is crazy to me that some of the stuff hasn't been. So I, we do have to hop off for another meeting maybe like. Yeah, the next step would be I guess. Yeah, like again, I guess. What would be the next step? Like you guys said there'd be an audit or something.

### Chris Andrade - 56:37

Yeah, yeah. We can run them through, run his through the, our audit process. Right. And schedule a time to go through that.

### Trent Christopher - 56:45

Yeah, that's fine. We can definitely just plan to do that another time if that's what you want to do. I know this was a lot of information and it wasn't as angle that you weren't really expecting. So you definitely need to probably noodle on it for a second and come up with some ideas of what you are expecting. But that would be the next step for us is really to just have a conversation but with intention, like with intention of trying to identify opportunities.

### Tyler Link - 57:07

Okay.

### Chris Andrade - 57:09

Like an hour, you think? An hour or less. We can get that done.

### Trent Christopher - 57:12

Yeah.

### Trent Christopher - 57:15

Okay, cool.

### Tyler Link - 57:17

Yeah, let's take some time to. I'll talk with Vincent, Eric and like I need to, you know, consider it as well. Yeah, either way. Good to meet you guys. Thanks for reaching out.

### Chris Andrade - 57:29

Bye.

### Trent Christopher - 57:29

Thanks for time, fellas. We really appreciate it.

### Tyler Link - 57:31

All right, thanks, guys.

## Post-Call Discussion (Concrete CEO Internal)

### +1 720-***-**84 - 57:32

Sergario. You know, I don't know. I sort of thought it was going to be like that, but it was a little bit more intense actually than I. Yeah. There's like four dudes. I'm like, whoa. Kind of. Feedback why I wanted to join and they did like, oh. And like, I have developers that are my friends want to build you a software. Well, I will say it was a little. It was fun. I did find it interesting because it was like they had a process to identify. It was like a business process with software as like the source we need to collect some existing software, in my opinion, that are like a bomb. Literally does that. That's what a bonus is. Like a hundred bucks a month. Yeah. I mean, I think.

### +1 720-***-**84 - 58:41

And I don't think it was necessarily like, oh, all the will build for you is custom. It's like they're kind of like a consultant, right. So the consultant get these three things. I'll show you how to install them. I think it's more flexible than it maybe came off, but. Oh, it's super flexible. Yeah, but that's the thing is, like, I don't find flexible product. No, no. I'm saying, like, I think they're. They're. Their audit process is more flexible. It's not necessarily like we. We build custom. It's like we can build custom stuff. We can also just help you install or they'll bring other tools to the table. You know what I'm saying? It's like, here's like, maybe it's a boma. We'll install that for you. I. I personally don't know, but I did find it interesting. I love that. That's so cool.

### +1 720-***-**84 - 59:27

I'm like, That would be so. Dude, if we had that'd be. We didn't market that, dude.

### Mekaiel Abdullahi - 59:38

Like.

### +1 720-***-**84 - 59:38

Oh, definitely. We should. I mean, if. Yeah, I mean, we should come to do this.

### Tyler Link - 59:47

Anyways.

### +1 720-***-**84 - 59:47

Yeah. Top on this and then. Yeah. We're just. Quick meeting. You can't figure it out. The.

### Tyler Link - 01:01:01

Times.

### +1 720-***-**84 - 01:01:02

Yeah, that was quite good, at least from our. And yeah. Knock.
