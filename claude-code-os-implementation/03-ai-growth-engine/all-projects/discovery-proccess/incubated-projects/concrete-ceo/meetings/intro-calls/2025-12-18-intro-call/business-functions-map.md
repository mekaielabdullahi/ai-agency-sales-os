## Executive Summary

Concrete CEO is a lead generation and business coaching company serving contractors (primarily concrete/construction). Based on the December 18, 2025 intro call with Tyler Link, the business is at a critical inflection point - ready to "revamp onboarding" and address operational gaps that are limiting growth and client success.

**Key Finding:** The core business functions are sound, but significant friction exists in onboarding, client readiness assessment, and tool adoption. Tyler explicitly stated "now is the time" for AI-powered improvements.

### 1. SALES FUNCTION

**Purpose:** Acquire contractor clients for lead generation services

**Sub-Functions:**
- Lead generation (for their own business)
- Discovery/qualification calls
- Proposal presentation
- Contract execution
- Revenue collection

**Current State:**
Tyler didn't discuss major sales pain points - their client acquisition appears functional.

**Pain Points (Tyler Quotes):**
> "My discovery process is always meant to be very much like, don't come off as salesy..."

> "I'm never trying to sell them on anything. I'm always trying to show them things and see if like the things I'm showing them, are they interested?"

**AI Opportunities:**
- Lead scoring automation
- CRM data enrichment
- Proposal generation assistance

**Priority:** Medium (not the primary pain area)

**Purpose:** Transition new clients from signed contract to active service delivery

**Sub-Functions:**
- Kickoff meetings
- Requirements gathering
- Access provisioning
- Training delivery
- Expectation setting
- Budget/financial planning

**Current State:**
This is the MOST problematic area. Tyler is planning a complete overhaul.

**Pain Points (Tyler Quotes):**

> "We are getting ready to really revamp our onboarding process. So now is the time."

> "We have a pretty good discovery to figure out like whether or not they're a good fit for what we do, and then we have a good execution. But our onboarding is kind of where we have a big gap."

> "I think our onboarding gap is really like... we don't know a lot of their numbers... A lot of times the client doesn't know a lot of their numbers."

> "We don't have financial stuff in our onboarding."

> "I just know there's a lot of room for growth when it comes to our onboarding process."

- Lead delivery
- Campaign optimization
- Performance reporting
- Client communication

**Current State:**
This function works well - it's their core competency.

**Pain Points (Tyler Quotes):**

> "Their margins were small and their schedule wasn't there... a lot of times we would set up something for them. And then because there was just nothing behind it, by the time they got their leads, there was just something they were having to learn on the fly."

> "Remus Development... didn't account for daily social media ad costs. Cash flow problems emerged mid-campaign."

**AI Opportunities:**
| Opportunity | Impact | Feasibility | ROI | Priority Score |
|-------------|--------|-------------|-----|----------------|
| Client capacity/workload prediction | 7 | 6 | 7 | 6.75 |
| Automated campaign performance alerts | 6 | 8 | 6 | 6.5 |

**Purpose:** Ensure clients achieve ROI and remain retained

**Sub-Functions:**
- Ongoing coaching/support
- Performance monitoring
- Issue intervention
- Retention management
- Upsell/expansion

**Current State:**
Tyler and team provide coaching, but struggle with clients who weren't properly qualified.

**Pain Points (Tyler Quotes):**

> "A lot of times people just aren't ready for what we do... people come to us and they say they want leads, but they actually need like their whole entire internal stuff figured out."

> "They just don't have the budget... we've been telling people they need budget... How do we actually figure out whether or not they have enough budget?"

> "There's always going to be some clients that... they'll say the right things in the discovery... they'll have the right setup internally... but then they just don't do it."

> "We have people that make their own way as well, but it's like how do I coach them all the way through that?"

|-------------|--------|-------------|-----|----------------|
| Client health scoring dashboard | 8 | 7 | 8 | 7.75 |

**Sub-Functions:**
- Tool development
- Template maintenance
- Training material creation
- IP protection
- Tool delivery to clients

**Current State:**
They have valuable tools trapped in Google Sheets that aren't being used effectively.

**Pain Points (Tyler Quotes):**

> "We have some really cool things that I really hate that they live on Google sheets."

> "We have a spreadsheet that really is like the best concrete pricing tool that I've ever seen... they put in like their operating costs, their labor costs... and then it gives them an estimate range for different types of jobs."

> "If we actually got that pricing tool into the hands of every single contractor... nobody uses it because they're not good at updating Google sheets and they're not the most user friendly."

> "I've tried to look at it as, you know, as a business owner, like, can I get somebody to do this? Like, I've gotten quotes that are really expensive."

**AI Opportunities:**
| Opportunity | Impact | Feasibility | ROI | Priority Score |
|-------------|--------|-------------|-----|----------------|
