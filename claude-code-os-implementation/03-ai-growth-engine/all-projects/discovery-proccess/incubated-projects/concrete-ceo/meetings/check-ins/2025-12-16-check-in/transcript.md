My brother's baby shower. Ty's baby shower is. Is this Sunday, and my dad got it from me, and I called him, and he's, like, super sick today, so I don't know if he's gonna be able to make it, which is a bummer. But it's not the end of the world. We can always do, you know, a different lunch or something like that. 
S
Speaker 1
00:20
You seen that show Modern Family? 
S
Speaker 2
00:24
I think I've seen a couple episodes. I haven't watched it consistently. 
S
Speaker 1
00:27
Well, there's one episode where he's saying thing. I think it was a baby shower or some sort, and he couldn't show, so they put him on an iPad with, like, on a. On one of those scooters. 
S
Speaker 2
00:38
Oh, yeah. Okay. I know exactly what you're talking about. Yeah. 
S
Speaker 1
00:42
What's up, man? You know, I sucks to hear. I hope that. No, but the baby shower is fun. That's cool. Tyler's having a baby. I give him, sincerely, my congrats. What a blessing that is. 
S
Speaker 2
00:52
Yeah, I definitely will. I definitely will. He. Yeah, he. He's. I would. I don't know. He's like, I love my life right now. So he's like, I know I'm gonna love my daughter, but I'm honestly, like, I'm afraid to give up, like, my current life. He's like, they try, you know, him and his wife travel quite a bit and all that, but he's excited, so. 
S
Speaker 1
01:14
That would be hard. Yeah. But nope. Yep, I get it. I get it. Is that. How many kids do you have? Kids? 
S
Speaker 2
01:21
I don't know. Not yet. 
S
Speaker 1
01:22
And how many kids does Tyler have? 
S
Speaker 2
01:25
This will be his first one. 
S
Speaker 1
01:26
Oh, dang. It's his first. Oh, man. He's into the world hurt. Oh, Lord. I got. Yeah, I got three. 
S
Speaker 2
01:34
Yeah. 
S
Speaker 1
01:34
Two girls, one boy. One's a senior. High school. So, yeah, good times, but, yeah, man. So how can I help you? What's going on? 
S
Speaker 2
01:43
Yeah, so first I wanted to make sure you got login to the software. 
S
Speaker 1
01:47
Yep. I got in, logged into the app. Yep. I got my password changed. It seemed like I don't know what was going on that, but yep, we're good there. 
S
Speaker 2
01:56
Okay, perfect. So next thing is billing. So I talked to Ty, and he is. So he's good. We delayed your building, like I said, by two weeks. Okay. And then he's good. Deposit for a month, so you guys won't get billed again until January 20th. 
S
Speaker 1
02:14
Such a blessing to hear, dude. Oh, my gosh. Like, that means a whole bunch. Like, that's gonna be a Christmas present for Mike for sure. We actually just got another big phone call yesterday that. We'Re gonna pull through, man. We just gotta make it till January. 
S
Speaker 2
02:33
Right. 
S
Speaker 1
02:34
So that is like that. It seems like there seems to be some movement waves or rumors going around the commercial because, dude, it's kind of scary how many big companies are not working right now. 
S
Speaker 2
02:49
We. 
S
Speaker 1
02:50
We. Yesterday, Yesterday, one of the big. Companies laid off 113 employees. Another concrete company laid off 40 guys. Like, it's getting bad. It's getting bad. And yeah, that's why I'm like, we. Well, if we can get a little bit of commercial work, which was. Seems that's what's happening, that would fund the ad campaign to get a more of a margin on the residential. Like it's a win. Win for us, you know. 
S
Speaker 2
03:26
Right, right. 
S
Speaker 1
03:27
So that would be a blessing. So. Yeah, man, thank you so much. 
S
Speaker 2
03:33
Yeah, of course. Yeah, I'm glad. I'm glad were able to. To get something figured out. And yeah, I'm glad you guys at least had a couple, you know, a couple decent sized jobs come in. So, yeah, I think we're trending in the right direction. And yeah, I have, you know, you guys are both very smart and very capable. You know, I'm sure we'll be able to figure it out. And you know, really, if we can make it to the spring, I know we'll be able to get you guys a lot of jobs. 
S
Speaker 1
03:57
I know. And I know we're gonna get there, dude. I know we're gonna get there. I know I have found faith. And what I'm working on right now is only gonna bring more leads into Remus's lead generator themselves. So I'm excited to be able to do what I do offline for a little bit while Remus development just continues to, you know, with the concrete stuff while I'm building out some other systems and marketing plans to help when we can just get over the holidays, you know. 
S
Speaker 2
04:31
Right, right. 
S
Speaker 1
04:32
Yeah, yeah. And touch on that. So again, I'll have a meeting with Mike and I'll let him know. Good news and all that. And I know you and I talked about when you guys came from your AI convention, some ideas that you guys had. How are those coming? 
S
Speaker 2
04:52
Yeah, so we, I mean, we have the chatbot on Caesar's website done. That's, that's working really well. Also, ask Eric on how he feels about the voice AI I know he's been working a lot on that, but I think he took a small break. Because I would say, like, it was probably the last time I tested it was probably like a 7 out of 10. 
S
Speaker 1
05:14
Right. 
S
Speaker 2
05:15
So it's not bad by any means, but say like, we still have an office manager. And so I was like, well, why do the voice AI if it's only a 7 out of 10 and we can still have a real person. 
S
Speaker 1
05:26
Yeah, yeah, 100%. And I think that, you know, I think we should keep the personal touch as much as possible until you can't or until it's justified, you know what I'm saying? And yeah, so I think that's a really good philosophy and I know you ran through it with me on Live when you guys initially started the development of it, and that's pretty cool that you have some sort of environment already built just on the link on the voice side of things. So that's pretty neat. 
S
Speaker 2
06:00
Yeah, yeah, we, there's a few other AI capabilities that we have. Like say we have. An AI autoresponder for reviews and then you can set it for only like four stars and above or five stars and above. So essentially only responding to the good reviews. It leaves a pretty generic response like, hey, Chris, thank you so much for your comments. Let us know if you ever need any work in the future, something like that. But it's all you really need. It's all you really need for, you know, for response to like a Google my business page review. Right. So there's a lot of small tools like that. The one I was most excited for was the voice AI, but it's just, it's not quite there. 
S
Speaker 2
06:45
And if you can deliver the personal, like it's a great tool if you're too busy to answer the phone. But if you can't answer the phone, that's still, that still is king, I think, at this point, at least. 
S
Speaker 1
06:55
Interesting. And so do you guys have like your own development like team going on over there or whatever? 
S
Speaker 2
07:03
So Eric. Yeah, you guys got a chance to meet Eric. Yeah, Eric is kind of our. He was kind of the one spearheading the voice AI and then I was doing the chat widget AI and then we have one other team member on kind of like the small tools AI, if that makes sense. 
S
Speaker 1
07:19
Yeah, yeah, Yep. Nice, nice. Well, you know, and you know how my philosophy, I think I've iterated this a lot with you, is just the customer service experience. Right. Honestly, my biggest priority and it turns out in life and it's kind of put me in a little niche and it's got me to meet some really cool people and it seems to be working. And, and Vince, I'm just gonna say that you know I do. It does seem like I have the mix ins to make a. Our own little consulting agency ourselves. And, and we. It looks like I am going to be partnering up with some developers and ultimately what it looks like it's happening. I got three guys. Trent, he owns his own business as a robotics industrial engineer. 
S
Speaker 1
08:24
And then Mikhail, he is a systems engineer that works for the Air Force and also has you know, work at the Pentagon. And Matthew, he, his expertise comes from Amazon and he was a developer at Amazon. And, and then me with my. Experience as being a consultant, you know, I think I've shared this is like I've just generated so many relationships across the board of people that do contractual. I mean, I mean any kind of work you can imagine. I mean people who sell fish, you like just so many different types of like spectrums of specialists. Right. And turns out that I came at this. Team because I, I think I told you about my parents company up there in Flagstaff. 
S
Speaker 2
09:22
Yeah, yeah you did. 
S
Speaker 1
09:23
And I think I told you I used to work as a commercial driver for the company that they sell buildings for. 
S
Speaker 2
09:31
Yeah, I think you did tell me. 
S
Speaker 1
09:33
Okay. Well it killed me that the experience always got murdered when a customer is full of excitement when I show up. But then because they, you know, simple things that they put time in that they gave the dealer or instructions or whatever have you, they got lost in the mix because corporate is corporate and they don't really care about the dealer or whatever. And you know, then it kind of kills the experience of somebody buying this building. And it like sucked. And so ultimately for four years I was trying to figure out how I can, you know, model that or enhance it. And well that's. I came up with the aha moment actually when going to Hermosi's live event, right. And watching him do his thing and that's when I had that aha moment. 
S
Speaker 1
10:28
And anyways that's what started me to develop my own software for my mom's business that ultimately turned into an opportunity to scale beyond belief. You know, and then that meant that I had to figure out how to do it and that's how I met these developers. Anyways, long story short, you know, we're just a group of dudes right now. We don't know where this is going. We are very passionate about Just customer service and ultimately how to deliver something that makes sense to the client. Like, we're not. We want to make sure whatever we deliver has a return of investment within 30 days, and that's ultimately how we get paid right at. At the end of it. So what I. Why I'm telling you this, Vince is the AI, the voice AI we've had. Like, Matthew is a really good with that side. 
S
Speaker 1
11:27
He actually, we work with this guy who has his own system already set up. He used to be a Salesforce guy. And I mean, what he did with voice AI is like, crazy, dude. It's insane. And so what I found out is that you have all these developers sitting and they are just like, you know, just, how can I help? How can I help? Oh, I got these tools. Oh, I got these tools. 
S
Speaker 1
11:56
You need these tools, you know, so if that's something that you feel like you can lean on to help ultimately design something for you guys that helps us learn, you know, and if there's a way that we can make something work where we're building out your systems with no pay, but ultimately understanding what is coming and trying to get ahead of it as much as we can, and if we can help get you there. Let's do it. 
S
Speaker 2
12:29
Yeah. Yeah. That I do. So I do have to hop here in a minute, but I would say that would be. So Ty. This is kind of the last update I had is Ty and Eric. I don't know if it would just be Ty. It'd just be Eric or if it be them Both. I think they're leaning towards both of them. They're willing to do a coaching call. I know you were looking for help with, like, systems and stuff like that. So they're willing to do a coaching call. I would say bring that up to Ty as a potential idea, and he would. He would probably have some more thoughts on it. I. I can't say, like, yes or no or like. 
S
Speaker 1
13:10
That I was just me and you built a relationship. Right. Ultimately, you know me as a character at the end of the day. I've had more conversations with you than. More than Ty, obviously, because he's a busy dude and he's getting ready to have a baby. You know, I understand that, and I don't want to come at it like I'm trying to, like, pressure. I'm not. I already have this going one way or the other. We just so happen to have a relationship, and I feel like I can provide value at minimum or nothing. Right. So if. Or when. If you can Just give me the opportunity and speak on, I guess, my behalf or my character when he comes to. That's the only reason why I even bring it up. 
S
Speaker 1
13:50
And then, yeah, just to give me that opportunity is ultimately the, at the end of the day, all I need. 
S
Speaker 2
13:56
Yeah. 
S
Speaker 1
13:57
Yeah. 
S
Speaker 2
13:57
Well, I would say maybe text some times that you'd be available to do that, like coaching call. And then I'll definitely talk to Ty beforehand and let them know that you're gonna. I'll definitely, you know, I'll definitely give you a glowing recommendation before you talk to Ty and I'll let you know, kind of talk through the details with him. Yeah, yeah, that's all I need, man. 
S
Speaker 1
14:19
That's all, you know, all I need is just a shot, dude. Just the opportunity, dude. That's it. And I'll. I'll send you my calendar link on Slack or text or how would you like that? And then you can just forward it to whoever and just book it through there. 
S
Speaker 2
14:35
Cool, that sounds good. 
S
Speaker 1
14:37
Do you want me to text it to you? 
S
Speaker 2
14:38
Yeah, I guess just Price Slack is easiest. 
S
Speaker 1
14:40
Sounds good. I'll send it your way. 
S
Speaker 2
14:43
All right, sounds good, Chris. 
S
Speaker 1
14:44
Appreciate your time. Look forward to that. Hope your dad can enjoy some of it. Maybe he might have to just bring a full on oxygen suit, who knows? 
S
Speaker 2
14:52
But yeah, I like the idea of the iPad on the scooter. 
S
Speaker 1
14:56
Yeah, I know, right? I think you could even rent them, my man. So you enjoy. Have fun. Talk to you soon. 
S
Speaker 2
15:03
All right, sounds good, Chris. Thanks, bye.
