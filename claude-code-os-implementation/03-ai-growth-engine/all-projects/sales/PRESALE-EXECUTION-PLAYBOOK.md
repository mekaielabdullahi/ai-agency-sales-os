# PRESALE EXECUTION PLAYBOOK
## From Lead to Closed Deal — Every Touchpoint, Every Timeline, Every Word

**Purpose:** Single source of truth for presale execution. One goal: generate revenue.
**Owner:** All Founders
**Status:** ACTIVE — Execute daily
**Created:** February 3, 2026

---

## HOW THIS DOCUMENT WORKS

This is not a strategy doc. This is an execution doc. Every touchpoint has:
- **Exact timing** (no more "TBD")
- **Ready-to-send copy** (personalize and go)
- **Action triggers** (what happens if they don't respond)
- **Owner** (who does what)

Follow this document top to bottom. If a lead enters your pipeline, this playbook tells you exactly what to do at every step until they close or you move them to long-term nurture.

---

## PRESALE PIPELINE OVERVIEW

```
STAGE 1: OUTREACH          → 4 touchpoints  → Goal: Book discovery call
STAGE 2: DISCOVERY          → 8 touchpoints  → Goal: Run 5 Questions, pitch audit
STAGE 3: AI AUDIT (1st $)   → 3 touchpoints  → Goal: Deliver audit, set up proposal
STAGE 4: PROPOSAL & CLOSE   → 4 touchpoints  → Goal: Signed contract + deposit
NURTURE: Long-term           → Ongoing        → Goal: Keep warm until ready
```

**Total presale touchpoints: 19**
**Target cycle time: 2-4 weeks from first contact to signed deal**

---

# STAGE 1: OUTREACH

**Goal:** Book a discovery call
**Touchpoints:** 4
**Timeline:** Days 0-10

---

### DAILY OUTREACH ROUTINE

Execute this every business day before anything else:

```
MORNING BLOCK (60-90 min):
1. Check CRM for follow-ups due today (15 min)
2. Send all scheduled follow-ups FIRST (15 min)
3. Research 3-5 new prospects (15 min)
4. Send 3-5 new outreach messages (30 min)
5. Log everything in CRM immediately

DO NOT skip follow-ups to send new outreach.
Follow-ups convert higher than cold outreach.
```

**Weekly targets per founder:**
- New outreach messages: 15-20
- Follow-ups sent: 10-15
- Calls booked: 3-5

---

### Touchpoint #1: Initial Outreach Message

**When:** Day 0
**Channel:** LinkedIn DM + Email (same day, within 1 hour of each other)
**Type:** Template — personalize first line, then send
**Time to write:** 5-10 minutes per message (research + personalize)

#### LinkedIn DM Version

```
Hey [First Name],

[PERSONALIZED HOOK — pick one:]
- I saw your post about [specific topic] — that's exactly what we help with.
- Noticed [Company] is growing fast — usually that's when ops start breaking.
- [Mutual connection] mentioned you might be dealing with [pain point].

Quick question: how much time does your team spend on [specific manual process relevant to their business]?

We help B2B service firms automate the operational bottlenecks that slow down growth. Typical result: 15-20 hours/week reclaimed, 40%+ faster sales cycles.

Worth a 15-min call to see if there's a fit? No pitch — just questions and quick insights.

[Your Name]
AriseGroup.ai
```

#### Email Version

```
Subject: Quick question about [Company]'s operations

Hi [First Name],

[Same personalized hook as LinkedIn]

I work with B2B service firms ($2M-$20M revenue) that are scaling but hitting operational bottlenecks — manual processes eating time, systems that don't talk to each other, teams that can't scale without more headcount.

We act as an embedded AI transformation partner. Not generic AI tools — actual operational infrastructure that makes your business run faster.

Would a 15-minute discovery call be worth your time this week? No pitch. I ask 5 questions about your ops, give you quick insights, and we go from there.

Here's my calendar: [Calendly Link]

Best,
[Your Name]
[Title], AriseGroup

If none of those work, just throw out a couple times and I'll make it happen.

Talk soon,
[Your Name]
```

#### Response: Interested but asking questions first

```
Good question — happy to give you context.

[Answer their specific question in 2-3 sentences]

The best way to see if we're a fit is a quick 15-min call where I learn about your specific situation. No pitch — just questions and insights.

Here's my calendar: [Calendly Link]

[Your Name]
```

#### Response: "Not interested" / "Not right now"

```
Totally respect that. Appreciate you letting me know.

If things change down the road, feel free to reach out. I'll keep you on my radar for any insights we publish that might be relevant to [their industry].

Thanks for the conversation today. Great learning about [Company]'s operations.

**My recommendation: Start with an AI Readiness Audit**

Before building anything, you need clarity on where AI will actually deliver ROI for [Company]. That's what the audit gives you.

**What you get:**
- Business function mapping (every core process documented)
- Opportunity matrix (quick wins vs. strategic vs. transformational)
- Prioritized roadmap with ROI estimates
- Executive presentation with implementation plan

**Investment:** $5,000-$7,500
**Timeline:** 2 weeks
**Deliverable:** Full AI transformation roadmap

This isn't a report that sits on a shelf. It's the blueprint for every decision you make about AI for the next 12 months.

**Next step:** If this makes sense, I'll send over an invoice and we can kick off next week.

Want to move forward? Just reply "yes" and I'll send the details.

Hi [First Name],

Thank you for the great discussion yesterday during the audit presentation.

As promised, attached is the implementation proposal based on our findings.

**Quick summary:**

The audit identified [X] high-ROI opportunities. I'm recommending we start with [top priority] because:
- Highest ROI: saves you ~$[amount]/month
- Fastest to implement: [X weeks]
- Foundation for everything else on the roadmap

**Proposal highlights:**
- Phase 1 (Prerequisites): [brief description] — $[amount], [X weeks]
- Phase 2 (AI Layer): [brief description] — $[amount], [X weeks]
- Total investment: $[amount]
- Payback period: [X months]

**Your audit fee ($[X,XXX]) is credited toward the implementation.**

I'd love to schedule 30 minutes to walk through this together and answer questions.

How does [Day] at [Time] work?

Best,
[Your Name]

P.S. — We're booking [Month] start dates. If we move forward by [Date], we can lock in a [specific date] kickoff.

### Touchpoint #17: Proposal Follow-Up #1

**Type:** Auto-send

```
Subject: RE: Implementation Proposal for [Company]

Hey [First Name],

I know it's a lot to digest. If it helps, I'm happy to do a 20-minute walkthrough where I focus on the parts most relevant to your priorities.

Any questions at all — fire away.

[Calendly Link]

[Your Name]
```

---

### Touchpoint #18: Proposal Follow-Up #2 (Value Reframe)

**When:** Day 7 after proposal sent (no response to Follow-Up #1)
**Type:** Auto-send

```
Subject: RE: Implementation Proposal for [Company]

[First Name],

Following up one more time.

Here's the math that keeps running through my head:

- Current cost of the problem: $[Q2 amount]/month
- That's $[Q2 x remaining months in year] between now and end of year
- Implementation investment: $[total] one-time
- Payback: [X months]

Every month this sits, it costs you $[Q2 amount].

I don't say that to pressure you — I say it because the audit showed us exactly where the money is going.

Three paths forward:
1. **Move forward** — reply "yes" and I'll send the contract this week
2. **Talk it through** — grab 15 minutes: [Calendly Link]
3. **Not right now** — tell me when to circle back

Which works for you?

[Your Name]
```

### Touchpoint #19: Contract + Invoice

   - Audit credit applied: -$[audit fee]

**To get started:**
1. Sign the contract (DocuSign — takes 2 min)
2. Pay the deposit invoice
3. I'll send kickoff details within 24 hours

Questions on the contract? Reply here or call me: [Phone]

Every lead that doesn't close goes into nurture. No lead gets forgotten. This is where future revenue lives.

---

## Nurture Segments

Tag every lead entering nurture with their last stage:

| Tag | Meaning | Temperature |
|-----|---------|-------------|
| `outreach-cold` | Never responded to outreach | Cold |
| `discovery-no-show` | Booked but didn't show | Warm |
| `discovery-complete` | Had call, declined audit | Warm |
| `audit-declined` | Received audit offer, didn't buy | Warm |
| `proposal-declined` | Received proposal, didn't close | Hot |
| `timing-not-now` | Explicitly said "not now" | Warm |

---

## Nurture Cadence

**Frequency:** 1 touchpoint every 3-4 weeks
**Duration:** 6 months minimum, then evaluate
**Channel:** Email (primary), LinkedIn engagement (secondary)

### Month 1: Value-First Email

**When:** 3 weeks after entering nurture
**Angle:** Share something useful, no ask

```
Subject: [Relevant insight about their industry]

Hey [First Name],

Came across this and thought of your situation at [Company]:

[1-2 paragraph insight about their industry + AI. Reference something specific from your conversation if you had one. Examples:]

- "We just helped a [similar company] automate their [process] — went from 6 hours/week to 20 minutes. Made me think of what you mentioned about [their pain point]."
- "Interesting trend in [their industry]: companies that [specific insight]. Given what you shared about [Company]'s operations, thought this might resonate."
- "[Share a relevant stat, article, or case study insight]"

No ask — just thought it might be useful.

[Your Name]
```

### Month 2: Quick Check-In

**When:** 3-4 weeks after Month 1 email

```
Subject: Quick check-in

Hey [First Name],

Hope things are going well at [Company].

Just curious — has the [pain point they mentioned] situation changed at all? We've been seeing a lot of movement in [their industry] around [relevant topic].

If you ever want to pick the conversation back up, I'm here: [Calendly Link]

No pressure either way.

[Your Name]
```

### Month 3: Case Study / Social Proof

**When:** 3-4 weeks after Month 2 email

```
Subject: How [similar company type] saved $[amount]/month

[First Name],

Quick update — we just wrapped a project with a [similar company description]:

**Their problem:** [Similar to prospect's pain point]
**What we built:** [Brief solution description]
**Result:** [Quantified outcome — hours saved, revenue gained, cost reduced]

Reminded me of what you shared about [Company] back in [month].

If you're curious how something similar could work for you, happy to chat: [Calendly Link]

[Your Name]
```

### Month 4: Industry Insight

**When:** 3-4 weeks after Month 3 email

```
Subject: [Industry] + AI in 2026

Hey [First Name],

[Share a genuine industry insight or trend. Keep it to 3-4 sentences.]

If [Company] is thinking about this, would love to compare notes.

[Your Name]
```

### Month 5: Direct Re-Engagement

**When:** 3-4 weeks after Month 4 email

```
Subject: Still on your radar?

[First Name],

It's been a few months since we last talked. I wanted to check in directly:

Is [pain point] still a challenge at [Company]?

If yes — I have some new approaches we've developed since we last spoke that might be worth exploring.

If things have changed or you've solved it another way — great, I'd love to hear how.

Either way, 15 minutes: [Calendly Link]

[Your Name]
```

### Month 6: Annual Breakup / Reset

**When:** 3-4 weeks after Month 5 email

```
Subject: Inbox cleanup

[First Name],

I'm doing an inbox cleanup and wanted to check — should I keep you on my radar for AI transformation at [Company], or should I close the loop?

No wrong answer. Just want to respect your time.

1. Keep me posted — things might change
2. Close it out — we're good for now

Either way, it's been great connecting.

[Your Name]
```

**If "Keep me posted":** → Restart nurture at Month 1 with fresh content
**If "Close it out" or no response:** → Archive. Revisit in 6 months with a single re-engagement email.

---

## LinkedIn Nurture (Parallel Track)

Do this alongside email nurture:

| Frequency | Action |
|-----------|--------|
| Weekly | Like/comment on their posts (genuine, relevant comments only) |
| Bi-weekly | Share your own content they'd find valuable |
| Monthly | Send a relevant article via LinkedIn DM (no pitch) |

**Rule:** Never pitch in LinkedIn nurture. Build visibility and trust. The emails handle the re-engagement asks.

# KEY RULES

1. **Follow-ups are non-negotiable.** Most deals close on follow-up #2-4, not the first message. Never skip them.
2. **Speed wins.** Respond within 2 hours. Send invoices within 1 hour. Send proposals within 24 hours. Slow = lost deal.
3. **Every "no" goes to nurture.** No lead is dead. They're just "not yet." The nurture sequence keeps them warm.
4. **Log everything.** If it's not in the CRM, it didn't happen. Update after every touchpoint.
5. **Don't pitch in follow-ups.** Follow-ups remove friction. They ask questions. They don't re-sell.
6. **The audit is the entry point.** Every discovery call should lead to an audit pitch. The audit creates the proposal. The proposal creates the deal.
7. **Credit the audit fee.** Always credit the audit investment toward implementation. It removes a buying objection and increases conversion.
