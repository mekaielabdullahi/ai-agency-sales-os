# THE STEPS

---

## STEP 1: Identify Prospect

**When:** During your daily morning outreach block
**Time:** 2-3 minutes per prospect to identify
**Goal:** Find people who match your ICP

### Where to Find Prospects

| Source | How | Priority |
|--------|-----|----------|
| LinkedIn Search | Search by title + industry + company size | Primary |
| LinkedIn Feed | People posting about operational pain, scaling, AI | Primary |
| Your Network | Past connections, 2nd-degree introductions | High |
| Referrals | Ask current clients "who else should I talk to?" | Highest |
| Industry Groups | LinkedIn groups, Slack communities, forums | Medium |
| Job Boards | Companies hiring ops/admin roles = pain signal | Medium |
| Conference/Event Attendees | Speakers, attendees at industry events | Medium |

### ICP Quick-Check

Before researching anyone, run this 30-second filter:

```
□ B2B service business?                      (Yes = continue, No = skip)
□ 10-100+ employees?                         (Yes = continue, No = skip)
□ $2M-$20M revenue range?                    (Yes = continue, No = maybe)
□ Founder, CEO, COO, VP Ops, or similar?     (Yes = continue, No = skip)
□ Active on LinkedIn OR has company website?  (Yes = continue, No = skip)
```

**If 4-5 boxes checked:** Research them (Step 2)
**If 3 boxes checked:** Maybe — research quickly and decide
**If <3 boxes checked:** Skip — not ICP

---

## STEP 2: Research & Qualify

**When:** Immediately after identification
**Time:** 8-10 minutes per prospect
**Goal:** Find a personalized hook and confirm they're worth outreach

### Research Checklist (Do In This Order)

```
TIME: 8-10 MINUTES TOTAL

1. LinkedIn Profile (2 min)
   □ Read their headline and about section
   □ Note their current role and how long they've been there
   □ Check recent activity — what are they posting/commenting about?
   □ Look for pain signals:
     - Hiring for ops/admin roles (= process pain)
     - Posting about scaling challenges
     - Commenting on AI/automation content
     - Mentioning manual work or "wearing too many hats"

2. Company Website (2 min)
   □ What do they actually do? (services, products)
   □ Team size (about page or LinkedIn company page)
   □ How sophisticated is their tech? (booking tool? CRM? basic website?)
   □ Any obvious automation gaps? (manual contact forms, no scheduling)

3. Recent Posts/Activity (3 min)
   □ Last 5-10 LinkedIn posts or comments
   □ Any content they've shared about their business challenges?
   □ Industry trends they care about
   □ Tone of voice — how do they communicate?

4. Personalization Hook (2 min)
   □ Pick THE ONE thing you'll reference in your outreach
   □ Must be specific to THEM (not generic industry stuff)
   □ Best hooks:
     - A specific post they wrote
     - A specific challenge they mentioned
     - A mutual connection
     - Something notable about their company growth
     - A job posting that signals pain
```

### Capture Sheet

Log this for every researched prospect before outreach:

```
Name:           _______________
Company:        _______________
Title:          _______________
LinkedIn URL:   _______________
Email:          _______________
Company Size:   _______________
Industry:       _______________
Pain Signal:    _______________
Hook:           _______________
ICP Score:      ___/5
```

### CRM Status Update

```
→ Set status: "RESEARCHED"
→ Add notes: Pain signal + hook
→ Tag: Industry vertical
```

---

## STEP 3: Send Initial Outreach

**When:** Day 0 — same day as research, during morning block
**Time:** 5-7 minutes to personalize and send
**Channels:** LinkedIn DM + Email (both, same day, within 1 hour of each other)
**Goal:** Get a response (not a sale)

### Why Both Channels?

LinkedIn DM has higher open rates. Email has higher reply rates. Using both increases your odds without being aggressive — different channels feel like different conversations, not spam.

### LinkedIn DM (Send First)

**Rules:**
- Keep under 100 words
- No links in first message (LinkedIn suppresses messages with links)
- Ask a question — questions get 2x more replies than statements
- Sound like a person, not a company

```
Hey [First Name],

[PERSONALIZED HOOK — one of these based on your research:]

→ If they posted about something:
"Saw your post about [topic] — [your genuine reaction in 1 sentence]."

→ If you found a pain signal:
"Noticed [Company] is [growing/hiring for X/expanding into Y] — that's usually when [specific operational challenge] starts showing up."

→ If mutual connection:
"[Name] mentioned you're dealing with [challenge] — that's exactly what I work on."

→ If company observation:
"Checked out [Company]'s site — impressive growth. Quick question: [specific question about their operations]."

Quick question: how much time does your team spend on [specific manual process you identified in research]?

We help [their industry] firms automate the ops bottlenecks that slow down growth. Typical outcome: 15-20 hours/week back, 40%+ faster [relevant process].

Worth a 15-min call to see if there's a fit?

[Your Name]
```

### Email (Send Within 1 Hour of LinkedIn DM)

**Rules:**
- Subject line: short, specific, no clickbait
- Include Calendly link in email (not in LinkedIn)
- Under 150 words for body
- One clear CTA

```
Subject: Quick question about [Company]'s [operations/growth/workflow]

Hi [First Name],

[SAME personalized hook as LinkedIn — reword slightly so it doesn't look copy-pasted]

I work with [their industry] firms ($2M-$20M) that are scaling but hitting operational bottlenecks — manual processes eating time, systems that don't connect, teams that can't grow without more headcount.

We build the AI infrastructure that makes your business run faster. Not generic tools — systems designed around how your team actually works.

Would a 15-minute discovery call be worth your time this week?

No pitch. I ask 5 questions about your ops, share quick insights, and we go from there.

Here's my calendar: [Calendly Link]

Best,
[Your Name]
[Title], AriseGroup
[Phone] | AriseGroup.ai
```

### After Sending — CRM Updates

```
→ Set status: "OUTREACH SENT"
→ Log: Date sent, channels used (LinkedIn + Email)
→ Set follow-up reminder: Day 3
→ Add to automation sequence (if running n8n/CRM automation)
```

### Quality Check Before Hitting Send

```
□ First name spelled correctly?
□ Company name correct?
□ Hook is specific to THEM? (not generic)
□ Under word limit? (100 LinkedIn / 150 email)
□ CTA is a question? (not a statement)
□ Calendly link works? (email only)
□ Signature complete?
□ Sounds human? Read it out loud — would you reply to this?
```

---

## STEP 4: Wait & Monitor (Days 1-2)

**When:** Days 1-2 after outreach
**Time:** 2 minutes per prospect
**Goal:** Watch for responses, don't send anything new to this person

### What to Do During the Wait

```
□ Check LinkedIn DMs for any reply (morning + afternoon)
□ Check email for any reply (morning + afternoon)
□ Check if they viewed your LinkedIn profile (= awareness signal, good)
□ Check if they liked/commented on your posts (= warming up)
□ DO NOT send anything else to them — let the outreach breathe
```

### If They Respond During Wait

→ Go immediately to **STEP 10: Response Handling**
→ Respond within 2 hours (same business day)

### If No Response by End of Day 2

→ Continue to **STEP 5** on Day 3

---

## STEP 5: Follow-Up #1

**When:** Day 3 — exactly 3 business days after initial outreach
**Time:** 2 minutes (template, minimal personalization needed)
**Channel:** Reply to your original message on the SAME channel
**Goal:** Bring the message back to top of inbox

### The Rule

Follow-Up #1 is NOT a re-pitch. It is a bump. Short. Casual. Low-pressure. Give them a reason to look at the original message again.

### If Original Was LinkedIn DM

```
Hey [First Name],

Floating this back up — know things get buried.

Short version: we help [their industry] firms automate the operational work eating their team's time. Average client reclaims 15+ hours/week.

Worth a quick chat?

[Your Name]
```

**Note:** Still no links in LinkedIn DM. If they say "sure" or "tell me more," THEN you send the Calendly link.

### If Original Was Email

```
Subject: RE: [Original Subject Line]

Hey [First Name],

Floating this back up — I know inboxes get crazy.

The short version: we help firms like [Company] automate the operational work that's eating your team's time. Average client saves 15+ hours/week.

Worth a quick chat? [Calendly Link]

[Your Name]
```

### After Sending — CRM Updates

```
→ Set status: "FOLLOW-UP 1 SENT"
→ Log: Date + channel
→ Set follow-up reminder: Day 7
```

---

## STEP 6: Wait & Monitor (Days 4-6)

**When:** Days 4-6 after initial outreach
**Time:** 1 minute per prospect to check
**Goal:** Watch for responses

### What to Do

```
□ Check LinkedIn DMs (morning + afternoon)
□ Check email (morning + afternoon)
□ LinkedIn engagement? (profile views, post engagement)
□ STILL do not send anything else — let the follow-up work
```

### If They Respond

→ Go to **STEP 10: Response Handling**

### If No Response by End of Day 6

→ Continue to **STEP 7** on Day 7

---

## STEP 7: Follow-Up #2 (Breakup)

**When:** Day 7 — exactly 7 business days after initial outreach
**Time:** 2 minutes
**Channel:** Reply on SAME channel as original + CROSS to the other channel
**Goal:** Final touchpoint — create urgency through takeaway

### The Strategy

This is your breakup message. The psychology: people respond to loss. By signaling you're walking away, you give them a reason to re-engage NOW.

Send on the original channel PLUS cross-post to the other channel you haven't followed up on yet:
- If original was LinkedIn DM → send breakup on LinkedIn DM AND email
- If original was email → send breakup on email AND LinkedIn DM

### LinkedIn DM Version

```
[First Name],

Last note from me — don't want to clog your inbox.

If automating your operations isn't a priority right now, totally get it.

But if it ever is, I'm here.

Wishing you a strong [Q1/Q2/etc].

[Your Name]
```

### Email Version

```
Subject: RE: [Original Subject]

[First Name],

Last note from me — don't want to clog your inbox.

If automating your operations isn't a priority right now, totally get it. But if it is, I'm here whenever timing is right.

Either way — wishing you a strong [quarter/month].

[Your Name]
```

### After Sending — CRM Updates

```
→ Set status: "FOLLOW-UP 2 SENT (BREAKUP)"
→ Log: Date + channels
→ Set final check reminder: Day 10
```

---

## STEP 8: Wait & Monitor (Days 8-10)

**When:** Days 8-10 after initial outreach
**Time:** 1 minute per prospect
**Goal:** Final response window

### What to Do

```
□ Check LinkedIn and email daily
□ This is often when breakup emails get replies ("sorry, just saw this")
□ Breakup emails have the highest response rate of any follow-up
□ Be ready — if they respond, move FAST
```

### If They Respond

→ Go to **STEP 10: Response Handling**

### If No Response by Day 10

→ Go to **STEP 9: Decision Gate**

---

## STEP 9: Decision Gate

**When:** Day 10 — no response to any of the 3 messages (outreach + 2 follow-ups)
**Time:** 1 minute
**Goal:** Classify and route the lead

### Decision

There's only one option here: **Move to Nurture.**

Three messages, two channels, 10 days, no response = they're not ready RIGHT NOW. That doesn't mean they're dead. It means their timing isn't aligned.

→ Go to **STEP 11: Move to Nurture**

---

## STEP 10: Response Handling

**When:** Within 2 HOURS of their reply (same business day, non-negotiable)
**Time:** 3-5 minutes to read, classify, and respond
**Goal:** Move toward booked call or graceful exit

### Response speed matters.

Studies show that responding within 5 minutes = 21x more likely to qualify the lead than waiting 30 minutes. You won't always hit 5 minutes, but 2 hours is the maximum. Set notifications. Check your DMs.

### Classify the Response

Read their reply and route to the correct sub-step:

| Their Response | Classification | Go To |
|---------------|----------------|-------|
| "Sure, let's talk" / "I'm interested" / "Send me a time" | **INTERESTED** | Step 12 |
| "What exactly do you do?" / "How does this work?" / "What's the cost?" | **QUESTIONS** | Step 13 |
| "Not right now" / "Maybe later" / "Busy this quarter" | **NOT NOW** | Step 11 |
| "Not interested" / "Please remove me" / "No thanks" | **NOT INTERESTED** | Step 14 |
| "We already have a solution" / "We're working with someone" | **COMPETITOR** | Step 14b |
| Referral: "Talk to my COO" / "You should reach [Name]" | **REFERRAL** | Step 15 |

---

### STEP 12: Interested — Book the Call

**Trigger:** They said yes or showed clear interest
**Goal:** Get the call on the calendar immediately — don't let momentum die

#### If Responding on LinkedIn

```
Great — looking forward to it.

Here's my calendar: [Calendly Link]

Grab whatever time works. If nothing lines up, throw out a couple options and I'll make it happen.

Talk soon,
[Your Name]
```

**Note:** This is the FIRST time you send a link in LinkedIn DM. Earlier messages had no links intentionally.

#### If Responding on Email

```
Subject: RE: [Thread]

Great — looking forward to it.

Here's my calendar to grab a time: [Calendly Link]

If none of those work, just throw out a couple times and I'll make it happen.

Talk soon,
[Your Name]
```

#### CRM Updates

```
→ Set status: "CALL SCHEDULING"
→ Log: Response date, response sentiment
→ Set reminder: Check in 48 hours if they haven't booked
```

#### If They Don't Book Within 48 Hours

```
Hey [First Name],

Just checking — did you get a chance to pick a time?

Here's the link again in case it got buried: [Calendly Link]

Happy to work around your schedule if those slots don't work.

[Your Name]
```

#### Once Call Is Booked

```
→ Set CRM status: "DISCOVERY SCHEDULED"
→ Hand off to DISCOVERY SEQUENCE
→ Outreach sequence COMPLETE for this prospect
```

---

### STEP 13: Questions — Answer Then Rebook

**Trigger:** They have questions before committing to a call
**Goal:** Answer directly, then redirect to the call

**The principle:** Answer their question in 2-3 sentences MAX, then redirect to a call where you can give them a real answer. Don't over-explain in text.

#### "What exactly do you do?"

```
Good question.

The best way to see if there's a fit is a quick 15-min call where I learn about [Company]'s specific situation. No pitch — just questions and insights.

Worth it? [Calendly Link]

[Your Name]
```

#### "How does this work?"

```
The short version:

1. We start with a paid AI Readiness Audit ($5-7.5K, 2 weeks) — we map your operations and build a prioritized roadmap
2. If the roadmap shows clear ROI, we build the systems (typically $15-35K)
3. Ongoing: we act as your AI team on retainer

But it starts with a 15-min discovery call to see if we're even a fit. No commitment.

Grab a time: [Calendly Link]

```

#### "What does it cost?"

```
Depends entirely on scope, but to give you ranges:

- AI Readiness Audit (entry point): $5,000-$7,500
- Implementation projects: $15,000-$35,000
- Ongoing partnership: $7,500-$20,000/month

But it only makes sense if the ROI is there. That's what the 15-min discovery call figures out — I ask about your operations and give you an honest assessment.

Worth exploring? [Calendly Link]

```

#### "Can you send more info?"

```
Sure — here's a quick overview:

[1-2 sentences about your services relevant to their situation]

That said, the most valuable thing I can send you is a specific assessment of where AI would deliver ROI for [Company]. That comes from a quick 15-min call.

Happy to do it this week: [Calendly Link]

No pitch — just questions and insights tailored to your operations.

```

#### CRM Updates

```
→ Set status: "ENGAGED - ANSWERING QUESTIONS"
→ Log: Their questions + your responses
→ Set reminder: If they don't book within 48 hours, follow up once
→ After 5 days of no response: Move to STEP 11 (Nurture)
     Tag: "engaged-but-stalled"
```

---

### STEP 14: Not Interested — Graceful Exit

**Trigger:** They said no
**Goal:** Leave the door open, protect your reputation, move to nurture

#### "Not interested" / "No thanks"

```
Totally respect that. Appreciate you letting me know.

If things change down the road, feel free to reach out. I'll keep you on my radar for any insights relevant to [their industry].

Best,
[Your Name]
```

#### "Please remove me" / "Stop emailing me"

```
Done — removed. Apologies for the interruption. Wishing you well.

[Your Name]
```

**Note:** Actually remove them. Do NOT put them in nurture. Mark as "DO NOT CONTACT" in CRM.

#### STEP 14b: Competitor — "We already work with someone"

```
Makes sense — glad you're already investing in this.

If you ever want a second opinion or things change, door's always open.

Best,
[Your Name]
```

#### CRM Updates

```
→ "Not interested": Set status "CLOSED - NOT INTERESTED" → Nurture (tag: outreach-declined)
→ "Remove me": Set status "DO NOT CONTACT" → No nurture, no future outreach
→ "Competitor": Set status "CLOSED - COMPETITOR" → Nurture (tag: has-competitor)
```

---

### STEP 15: Referral Handling

**Trigger:** They referred you to someone else at their company or in their network
**Goal:** Leverage the referral with a warm intro

#### If Internal Referral ("Talk to my COO")

```
Great — appreciate you pointing me in the right direction.

Would you be open to making a quick intro? Even a one-line message would go a long way. Something like:

"Hey [Referral Name], [Your Name] from AriseGroup reached out about AI automation — I think it's worth a conversation. Here's their calendar: [Calendly Link]"

If you'd prefer, I can reach out directly and mention you.

Thanks,
[Your Name]
```

#### If External Referral ("You should talk to [Name] at [Company]")

```
Really appreciate that — I'll reach out to them.

Mind if I mention your name? A warm intro always helps.

And if anything changes on your end, I'm here.

Thanks,
[Your Name]
```

Then: Start the OUTREACH SEQUENCE from Step 1 for the referral, with the referrer's name as your hook.

#### CRM Updates

```
→ Original contact: Set status "REFERRAL GIVEN"
→ Move original to Nurture (tag: referral-source)
→ Create new contact for referral
→ New contact status: "RESEARCHED" (skip Step 1, start at Step 2)
→ Log: Referral source name
```

---

## STEP 11: Move to Nurture

**Trigger:** No response after full sequence, OR "not now" response, OR any non-booking exit
**Time:** 2 minutes
**Goal:** Tag, categorize, and enter the long-term nurture sequence

### Tagging System

Apply the correct tag based on where they dropped off:

| Exit Point | CRM Tag | Temperature |
|------------|---------|-------------|
| No response to any outreach | `outreach-no-response` | Cold |
| Responded "not now" | `outreach-timing` | Warm |
| Responded "not interested" | `outreach-declined` | Cold |
| Had competitor | `outreach-competitor` | Cold |
| Gave referral | `outreach-referral-source` | Warm |
| Engaged with questions but didn't book | `outreach-engaged-stalled` | Warm |
| Booked but then went silent | `outreach-booking-ghosted` | Warm |

### CRM Updates

```
→ Set status: "NURTURE"
→ Apply tag from table above
→ Set nurture start date: Today + 21 days (3 weeks)
→ Add to nurture automation (if running n8n) OR set manual reminder
→ Log: Full outreach history (messages sent, responses received)
```

### What Happens Next

This prospect enters the **Nurture Sequence** (documented in PRESALE-EXECUTION-PLAYBOOK.md):

```
Week 3:   Value email — insight, no ask
Week 7:   Quick check-in — soft ask
Week 11:  Case study — social proof
Week 15:  Industry insight — thought leadership
Week 19:  Direct re-engagement — explicit ask
Week 23:  Breakup / reset — stay or go
```

**This is NOT the end.** 60%+ of B2B deals close after the initial "no" or silence. The nurture sequence exists because timing is everything — and when their timing changes, you need to be the first person they think of.

# VOLUME TARGETS

## Per Founder, Per Week

| Activity | Target | Notes |
|----------|--------|-------|
| New prospects researched | 15-20 | Step 1-2 |
| New outreach sent | 15-20 | Step 3 |
| Follow-ups sent | 10-15 | Steps 5 + 7 |
| Responses handled | 3-5 | Step 10 (15-20% response rate) |
| Calls booked | 2-4 | Step 12 |
| Leads moved to nurture | 10-15 | Step 11 |

## Expected Conversion Math

```
100 outreach messages sent (5 weeks of consistent effort)
 └─ 15-20 responses (15-20% response rate)
      └─ 8-12 interested or questions (50-60% of responses)
           └─ 5-8 calls booked (60-70% of interested)
                └─ 3-5 audits sold (60-70% of calls)
                     └─ 2-3 implementation deals (60-70% of audits)

Revenue from 100 outreach messages:
- Audits: 3-5 x $5,000-$7,500 = $15,000-$37,500
- Implementations: 2-3 x $15,000-$35,000 = $30,000-$105,000
- Total pipeline: $45,000-$142,500

This compounds. Month 2 you have nurture leads re-engaging.
Month 3 you have referrals. Month 4+ the pipeline is self-feeding.

# RULES

1. **Never skip a follow-up.** Day 3 and Day 7 are non-negotiable. Set CRM reminders.
2. **Respond within 2 hours.** Speed = trust. If they replied, they're thinking about you RIGHT NOW.
3. **LinkedIn first, email second.** LinkedIn gets seen. Email gets read. Use both.
4. **No links in LinkedIn DMs** until they express interest. Links kill reach.
5. **Follow-ups are bumps, not re-pitches.** Shorter than the original. New angle, same CTA.
6. **Breakup emails get the highest reply rate.** Don't skip Day 7.
7. **Log everything.** Your CRM is your memory. If it's not logged, it didn't happen.
8. **Personalize the hook. Template the rest.** Spend your research time on the first line. The rest is framework.
9. **Morning outreach, afternoon responses.** Block your calendar. Protect the routine.
10. **Every "no" enters nurture.** The only lead that's dead is one tagged "DO NOT CONTACT."
