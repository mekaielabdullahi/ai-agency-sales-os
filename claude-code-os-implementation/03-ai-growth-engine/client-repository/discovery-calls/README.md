> - Do NOT make up any details
> - Only derive information that is EXPLICITLY stated in facts
> - Do NOT hallucinate or infer unstated information
> - Do NOT make up anything that appears factual unless derived from explicit source data
> - All metrics, numbers, and specifics must come from documented sources
> - If information is unknown, state "Unknown" or "TBD" - never guess
