# Discovery Call - David (Equipment Share)

**Date:** December 12, 2025
**Participants:** David, Chris, Development Team
**Industry:** Construction equipment rental & sales
**Call Type:** Initial discovery / requirements gathering

---

> **CRITICAL: All information below is EXPLICITLY stated by David during the call.**
> No inferences, assumptions, or hallucinated data.

---

## Q1: Biggest Problem

**David's Words:**
> "I need help on my sales side of being able to organize like customers and keeping up with follow ups"

> "I don't really have a good process other than David remembering"

**The Problem:** No sales CRM system. Follow-ups rely entirely on David's memory.

**Who's Affected:** David (sales function)

**Frequency:** Ongoing - every customer interaction

---

## Q2: Monthly Cost

**UNKNOWN** - David did not provide quantitative data.

Missing metrics:
- Number of contacts/customers
- Deal volume per month
- Average deal size
- Current close rate
- Time spent on sales activities
- Revenue figures

**Action Required:** Follow-up discovery to capture these numbers before any ROI projections.

---

## Q3: Duration

**UNKNOWN** - Not explicitly stated how long this has been a problem.

**What's Been Tried:**
- Equipment Share is building something but David said: "I think what they're building is trash"
- No other CRM attempts mentioned

**Tipping Point:** Taking this call indicates readiness to solve it now.

---

## Q4: Cost of Inaction

**UNKNOWN** - Cannot project without baseline metrics.

**Cannot Assess:**
- Financial impact of current state
- Time/efficiency losses
- Scale of missed opportunities
- ROI projections

---

## Q5: Magic Wand (Desired Solution)

**David's Words:**
> "I want my phone to get uploaded into here"

> "Remind me in one week about the quote. Done."

> "reminders and notes and follow throughs"

> "I wonder if I could build myself almost like a AI assistant to where it's like, handling all the stuff on the backside"

> "I just want to be able to just do it... just go and execute"

**Vision Summary:**
1. Phone contact sync to CRM
2. Simple reminder system ("remind me in one week")
3. Follow-up tracking
4. AI assistant handling backend admin
5. Execution-focused (minimal friction)

## Current State

### What's Working

**T3 System** (Equipment Share's file sharing)
> "It's been the most streamlined thing I think I've ever used in my life"
> "I have access to every file and document I need"

### What's Broken

**Sales Organization:**
> "They don't have the sales side integrated where like there's follow ups or reminders put in"

**Follow-up Process:**
> "I don't really have a good process other than David remembering"

---

## David's AI Knowledge

**Self-rated: Zero**
> "I don't know crap about it"

**Implication:** Solution must be extremely simple. Zero learning curve. Just works.
