## 💡 PRO TIPS

### 1. **Listen More Than You Talk**
- 80% listening, 20% talking
- Questions are about THEM, not YOU

### 2. **Follow the Energy**
- When they get animated, dig deeper
- "Tell me more about that..."
- "Why is that important to you?"

### 3. **Silence is Powerful**
- Ask question
- Shut up
- Let them fill the silence
- Best insights come after pauses

### 4. **Take Notes Visibly**
- "Let me write that down - this is important"
- Shows you value what they're saying
- Captures exact language they use

### 5. **Use Their Words Back**
- Client says: "Our onboarding is painfully slow"
- You say: "Tell me more about the onboarding being painfully slow..."
- Don't translate - use their exact phrasing

### 6. **The "Why" Chain**
- Ask "why" 3-5 times to get to root cause
- Problem: "We're not closing enough deals"
- Why? "We're slow to respond to leads"
- Why? "Our CRM doesn't notify us fast enough"
- Why? "It's not integrated with our forms"
- → REAL PROBLEM: Integration gap, not sales skills
