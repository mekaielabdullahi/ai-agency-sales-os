# End-User Interview Questions Template
## The On-the-Ground Reality

**Interview Type**: End-User / Frontline Staff
**Target Roles**: Individual contributors, specialists, coordinators, analysts, frontline workers
**Duration**: 30-45 minutes
**Format**: Remote video call or in-person (screen sharing recommended)
**Tools**: Zoom/Meet + Fireflies.ai for recording

---

## Interview Objectives

This interview uncovers the **operational reality** of:
- Daily tasks and workflows
- Manual processes and workarounds
- Time-consuming repetitive work
- System frustrations and data flow
- Real bottlenecks and errors

**Key difference from stakeholder interviews**: End-users show you "how work actually gets done" vs. "how leadership thinks it gets done"

---

## Pre-Interview Checklist

- [ ] Reviewed sales handoff packet
- [ ] Reviewed stakeholder interview notes
- [ ] Researched interviewee role on company website
- [ ] Prepared to see their screen (ask for screen share)
- [ ] Recording tool tested and ready
- [ ] Backup note-taking method prepared
- [ ] Got explicit permission to record

---

## Opening (2-3 minutes)

**Purpose**: Build rapport and set comfortable expectations

"Thank you for making time today. I want to learn about your day-to-day work - the tasks you do, the tools you use, and what makes your job easier or harder. There are no right or wrong answers. I'm not evaluating you or your performance - I'm trying to understand the reality of the work so we can identify ways to make your job easier and more efficient.

This conversation should take about 30-45 minutes. If you're comfortable, I'd love to see your screen while you walk me through how you do certain tasks - that helps me understand much better than just talking about it.

Is it okay if I record this so I can focus on our conversation instead of taking notes? The recording is just for my reference."

1. You spend most of your time on [tasks], especially [specific task]
2. The biggest pain points are [pain 1] and [pain 2]
3. The most frustrating part is [specific frustration]
4. You're spending about [X] hours per week on [repetitive task]

Did I capture that correctly? Anything important I missed?"

**Validate specific numbers:**
- "You mentioned spending [X] hours on [task] - is that per day or per week?"
- "You said [pain point] happens [frequency] - is that about right?"

**Ask for the wishlist:**
"If you could change ONE thing about how you work, what would have the biggest impact on your day-to-day?"

## Pro Tips for End-User Interviews

### Do's ✅

1. **Ask to see their screen** - Watching them work reveals hidden steps
2. **Document EVERY step** - Even "obvious" ones that seem automatic
3. **Quantify everything** - "About how many times?" "About how long?"
4. **Let awkward silences sit** - They're thinking, give them space
5. **Stay curious, not judgmental** - "That's interesting, tell me more"
6. **Capture their exact words** - Their quotes sell the solution
7. **Follow the energy** - When they get animated, dig deeper there
8. **Watch for frustration** - Sighs, eye rolls, "ugh" moments = pain points
9. **Ask for examples** - "Show me the last time you did this"
10. **Validate your understanding** - Repeat back what you heard

### Don'ts ❌

1. **Don't suggest solutions** - "What if we automated..." → save for later
2. **Don't accept "it depends"** - Push for specifics, ranges, examples
3. **Don't skip the boring parts** - Boring = repetitive = automatable
4. **Don't make them feel dumb** - Their workarounds are creative, not wrong
5. **Don't rush** - Let them show you their actual workflow
6. **Don't assume their manager knows** - They often don't
7. **Don't multitask** - Be fully present, this is where you find gold

## Patterns to Watch For

### The Gap Between Stakeholder and End-User

| Stakeholder Said | End-User Reality | Opportunity |
|------------------|------------------|-------------|
| "We use a CRM" | "I also maintain a spreadsheet because the CRM is missing fields" | CRM customization or better tool |
| "Response time is good" | "I manually check email every hour because we don't have notifications" | Automated notifications |
| "The process is documented" | "I had to figure it out myself, the docs are outdated" | Process documentation update + automation |
| "The team is productive" | "I spend 15 hours a week on manual tasks" | Automation opportunities |

**When you see gaps, you've found opportunities.**

### When you sense pain:
- "That sounds frustrating - tell me more"
- "What's the impact when that happens?"
- "How do you deal with that?"
- "What would make that easier?"

### When you need to understand workflow:
- "What happens before that step?"
- "What happens after that step?"
- "Where does that data come from?"
- "What do you do with that data next?"

- "What happens if that step fails?"
- "How do you fix it when that happens?"

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### ❌ Mistake 1: Only Interviewing Managers
**Why it's bad**: Managers often don't know the day-to-day reality
**Fix**: Always interview the people doing the actual work

### ❌ Mistake 2: Not Watching Them Work
**Why it's bad**: People forget steps when just talking about it
**Fix**: Ask to see their screen, watch them do the task

### ❌ Mistake 3: Accepting Round Numbers
**Why it's bad**: "A couple hours" could mean 2 or 10
**Fix**: Push for specific estimates, show them the math

### ❌ Mistake 4: Skipping "Obvious" Questions
**Why it's bad**: Obvious to them ≠ obvious to you
**Fix**: Ask everything, even if it seems basic

### ❌ Mistake 5: Not Quantifying Time
**Why it's bad**: Can't build ROI case without numbers
**Fix**: For every task, ask "How long?" and "How often?"

### ❌ Mistake 6: Talking Too Much
**Why it's bad**: You learn nothing while talking
**Fix**: 80/20 rule - let them talk 80% of the time

### ❌ Mistake 7: Pitching Solutions Mid-Interview
**Why it's bad**: Stops them from sharing more problems
**Fix**: Just listen and document. Solutions come later.
