## Opening (2-3 minutes)

**Purpose**: Build rapport and set expectations

"Thank you for taking the time today. The goal of this conversation is to understand your team's current workflows, challenges, and goals so we can identify the highest-impact opportunities for AI and automation.

I'll ask questions about your role, your team's processes, and where you see bottlenecks. There are no wrong answers - I'm here to listen and learn. This should take about 30-45 minutes.

Is it okay if I record this conversation so I can focus on our discussion rather than taking notes? The recording is just for my reference and won't be shared."

3. [Priority 3]

And the biggest pain points are:
1. [Pain point 1 - with metric if you got one]
2. [Pain point 2 - with metric if you got one]

Did I capture that correctly? Anything I missed?"

**Next steps:**

"Thank you so much for your time. Next steps:
1. I'll be interviewing [X] more people on your team to understand the day-to-day workflows
2. We'll analyze all the insights and identify the highest-impact opportunities
3. We'll present our findings and recommendations by [date]

Can I follow up with you if I have any clarifying questions?"

**Get referrals:**

"Who else on your team should I definitely talk to? Who would give me the best perspective on [specific process mentioned]?"

## Pro Tips for Stakeholder Interviews

### Do's ✅

1. **Listen 80%, talk 20%** - Resist the urge to solve problems in the interview
2. **Ask "Why?" 3-5 times** - Get to root cause, not just symptoms
3. **Quantify everything** - "About how many hours?" "How much revenue?"
4. **Capture exact quotes** - Their words sell better than yours
5. **Stay curious** - Even if you think you know the answer, let them tell you
6. **Take note of emotion** - Where do they get frustrated? Excited? Resigned?
7. **Validate your understanding** - "So what I'm hearing is..." and confirm

### Don'ts ❌

1. **Don't pitch solutions** - Not yet. You're still learning.
2. **Don't accept vague answers** - "It's slow" → "How slow? Minutes? Hours? Days?"
3. **Don't skip the "Why?"** - Surface-level problems hide deeper issues
4. **Don't talk over them** - Silence is okay. Let them think.
5. **Don't assume** - Even if you've seen this 100 times, their context is unique
6. **Don't lead the witness** - "Don't you think AI could..." → just listen
7. **Don't skip follow-ups** - "That's interesting, tell me more about that"

## Common Stakeholder Interview Patterns

### Pattern 1: The Gap
**Stakeholder says**: "We need to reduce lead response time"
**End-user reality**: Manual data entry delays everything
**Opportunity**: Automation of lead capture and routing

### Pattern 2: The Blind Spot
**Stakeholder says**: "The team is productive"
**End-user reality**: 15 hours/week on redundant manual tasks
**Opportunity**: Time reclamation through automation

### Pattern 3: The Symptom vs. Root Cause
**Stakeholder says**: "We need better reporting"
**Root cause**: Data lives in 5 different systems
**Opportunity**: Integration and data centralization

### Pattern 4: The "We Tried That"
**Stakeholder says**: "We tried a CRM, it didn't work"
**Real issue**: No training, poor adoption, wrong tool
**Opportunity**: Change management + right-fit solution

## Sample Follow-Up Questions

Use these when you need to dig deeper:

**When they give a vague answer:**
- "Can you give me a specific example of when that happened?"
- "What does that look like in practice?"
- "Walk me through the last time you experienced that"

**When you need quantification:**
- "Roughly how often does that happen?"
- "About how long does that take?"
- "How many people are affected by that?"
- "What's the cost of that happening?"

**When you sense there's more:**
- "Tell me more about that"
- "What else?"
- "Anything else contributing to that problem?"

**When you need to understand causation:**
- "Why is it done that way?"
- "What's causing that to happen?"
- "What would need to change for that to improve?"

**When you need to understand impact:**
- "What happens when that doesn't work?"
- "How does that affect your customers?"
- "What's the cost of that continuing?"

**Next**: After stakeholder interviews, conduct **End-User Interviews** to validate and get ground-level details.
