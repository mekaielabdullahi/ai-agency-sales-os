Hey [First Name],

Here's what happens next:

**1. Book your onboarding call**
This is a quick 15-20 minute call where we'll get all the technical stuff sorted - logins, platform access, any two-factor codes. It's the #1 thing that speeds up projects.

Book here: [CALENDAR LINK]

**2. Before the call (optional but helpful)**
If you want to get a head start, here are the platforms we'll need access to:
- [Platform 1]
- [Platform 2]
- [Platform 3]

Don't worry about setting these up yourself - we'll walk through everything together on the call.

**3. What we're doing on our end**
- Setting up your project workspace
- Creating your dedicated Slack channel
- Prepping the technical architecture

**Timeline reminder:**
- Onboarding call: This week
- Project Kickoff: [Week X]
- Target completion: [Date]

Questions? Just reply to this email.

Talk soon,
[Your First Name]

## Key Principles

1. **Clear action item** - The calendar link should be obvious
2. **Set expectations** - They know what's happening and when
3. **Remove anxiety** - "Don't worry, we'll do it together"
4. **Show momentum** - "Here's what we're doing on our end"
5. **Easy to respond** - "Just reply to this email"

---

## What NOT to Do

- Don't overwhelm with too many links or attachments
- Don't ask them to do lots of prep work
- Don't be vague about timeline
- Don't use passive voice ("An onboarding call will be scheduled...")
- Don't forget the calendar link (most important element!)

You'll have a working system, training videos, and documentation.
