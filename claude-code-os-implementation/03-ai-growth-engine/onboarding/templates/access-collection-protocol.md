# Access Collection Protocol

## Overview

This protocol ensures all necessary client credentials for system integrations are gathered safely, securely, and efficiently. Proper access collection is critical for project success and client data security.

---

## Security Standards

### Non-Negotiable Rules

1. **NEVER request credentials via regular email**
2. **ALWAYS use encrypted channels for credential transmission**
3. **NEVER store credentials in plaintext documents**
4. **ALWAYS use password manager encrypted vault**
5. **NEVER share credentials beyond essential team members**
6. **ALWAYS remove credentials immediately upon project completion**

---

## Tools & Technologies

### Approved Credential Collection Methods

**Primary Method:**
- Encrypted Password Manager (1Password, LastPass, Bitwarden for Business)
- Client gets secure share link
- Auto-expiring access

**Secondary Method:**
- Secure Form (Typeform with encryption)
- Google Forms (with immediate transfer to vault)
- Direct entry into encrypted vault during screenshare

**NEVER:**
- Regular email
- Slack/WhatsApp messages
- Shared Google Docs

## SECTION 2: Access Request Email Template

### Template: Initial Access Request

**Subject:** [Arise Group AI] Secure Access Collection for Your Automation Project

---

Hi [Client Name],

We're excited to begin building your automation system! To get started, we'll need secure access to the platforms we'll be integrating.

**Why we need access:**
To build your automation system, we need to connect your existing tools (CRM, website, booking system, etc.) so they can communicate with each other automatically.

**Security promise:**
- All credentials are stored in our encrypted password vault
- Only essential team members will have access
- We use industry-standard security practices
- Credentials will be removed when the project concludes

**What we need access to:**
Based on your tech stack, we'll need credentials for:

[CUSTOMIZE THIS LIST BASED ON CLIENT]
✅ [CRM Name] - Admin login
✅ [Website Platform] - Admin access
✅ [Email Marketing Tool] - API key
✅ [Booking System] - Admin access
✅ [Social Media Accounts] - Admin access
✅ [Other Tool] - [Type of access needed]

**How to provide access securely:**

**Option 1: Encrypted Password Share (Recommended)**
We'll send you a secure, encrypted link where you can submit all credentials. The link expires after 48 hours.
[SECURE LINK HERE]

**Option 2: Screenshare Session**
We can schedule a 15-minute screenshare where you'll enter credentials directly into our encrypted vault while we guide you.
[CALENDLY LINK HERE]

**Option 3: Add Us as Users**
For some platforms, you can simply add our team email as an admin user:
Team Email: [team@company.com]

**What happens next:**
Once we receive access, we'll:
1. Verify all credentials work (within 24 hours)
2. Begin the technical audit
3. Notify you when the audit is complete

**Timeline:**
Please provide access within 48 hours so we can stay on schedule for your [Week X] go-live date.

## SECTION 5.1: 1Password Integration Protocol

### Vault Structure

```
AriseGroup Vault
├── Active Clients
│   ├── Client - Acme Corp
│   │   ├── CRM (GoHighLevel Admin)

### 1Password CLI Commands

**Create client vault:**
```bash
op vault create "Client - {{client_name}}"
```

**Grant team member access:**
```bash
op vault user grant \
  --vault "Client - {{client_name}}" \
  --user "{{email}}" \
  --permissions "view_items"
```

**Revoke access:**
```bash

```

### Credential Expiry Monitoring

The Security Agent monitors for:
- **OAuth tokens** expiring within 30 days

Alert format:
```
:key: CREDENTIAL EXPIRY WARNING

## SECTION 5.2: Live 2FA Handling Protocol

### Why This Matters

2FA is the #1 logistics blocker for automation projects. Handle it ALL during the Logistics Onboarding Call.

### Call Script Block (Add to Logistics Call)

**Say:**
> "Now we're going to handle any two-factor authentication. This is the #1 thing that slows down projects - needing to interrupt you at random times for codes. Let's knock it all out now."

### 2FA Handling Process

1. **Open first platform requiring 2FA**
2. **Initiate login/connection**
3. **Say:** "You should receive a text or email now - what's the code?"
4. **Enter code immediately** (codes expire in 30-60 seconds)
5. **Confirm connection successful**
6. **Repeat for all platforms**

### Platforms Commonly Requiring 2FA

| Platform | 2FA Type | Notes |
|----------|----------|-------|
| Make.com | Email | Verification on new connection |
| Google Workspace | OAuth | May prompt on API connection |
| Slack | OAuth | First connection only |
| Stripe | SMS/App | Dashboard login |
| HubSpot | SMS/Email | API key generation |
| Meta Business | SMS/App | Page connections |

### If 2FA Fails

1. Try alternate method (app authenticator vs SMS)
2. If still blocked, document and schedule 15-min follow-up
3. Never let 2FA become a multi-day blocker
4. Worst case: Client shares screen and completes connection themselves

### Success Criteria

By end of Logistics Call:
- [ ] All platforms connected
- [ ] All 2FA completed
- [ ] Zero outstanding credential requests
- [ ] Client says "What else do you need?" Answer: "Nothing!"

---

### Credential Lifecycle

**Phase 1: Collection**
- Collected via secure channel
- Immediately stored in vault
- Never stored in email/chat

**Phase 2: Active Use**
- Restricted to project team
- Used only for authorized work
- Never shared outside vault

**Phase 3: Archival**
- 30 days post-project, mark as "Archive"
- Client notified of credential removal
- Credentials deleted from vault

---

## SECTION 6: Client Communication Script

### Handling Security Concerns

**Client says: "I'm not comfortable giving you my passwords"**

**Response:**
"I completely understand your concern - security is critical. We have a few options:

1. **Add us as admin users** instead of sharing your password. You maintain control and can revoke access anytime.

2. **Screenshare session** where you enter credentials directly into our encrypted vault while we guide you. You'll see exactly where they're stored.

3. **Temporary API keys** for platforms that support it. These can be revoked immediately after the project.

4. **Create project-specific accounts** with only the permissions we need.

Which option feels most comfortable for you?"

---

**Client says: "How do I know my data is secure?"**

**Response:**
"Great question. Here's our security protocol:

✅ Enterprise-grade encrypted password vault (bank-level encryption)
✅ Access restricted to only 2-3 team members working on your project
✅ Credentials automatically removed 30 days after project completion
✅ We never store credentials in email, docs, or chat
✅ All team members are under NDA
✅ We're happy to sign any additional security agreements you require

We take security as seriously as you do. Many of our clients are in healthcare, legal, and finance - we're experienced with strict security requirements."

---

**Client says: "I don't have admin access myself"**

**Response:**
"No problem. Who in your organization has admin access? We can coordinate directly with them, or we can hop on a quick call with both of you to explain what we need and why.

Alternatively, we can provide a technical specification document they can review before granting access."
