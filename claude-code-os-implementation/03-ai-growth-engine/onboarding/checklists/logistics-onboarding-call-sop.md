# Logistics Onboarding Call SOP

**Purpose:** Front-load ALL logistics (credentials, 2FA, platform access) in a single call immediately after payment to prevent project delays.

**Duration:** 15-30 minutes
**Format:** Video call (Zoom/Google Meet) with client screen-sharing
**When:** Within 24-48 hours of payment confirmation

---

## Why This Call Exists

> "Logistics (2FA, passwords, platforms) are the #1 cause of delays and frustration in automation projects."

This is NOT the full project kickoff. This is a focused logistics session to:
- Collect all platform access live
- Handle 2FA codes in real-time (they expire quickly)
- Set basic expectations
- Get you unblocked to start building

The full 60-minute Project Kickoff (audit presentation, detailed roadmap) happens AFTER this call.

## Section 1: Gratitude & Purpose (2 min)

### Opening Script

> "Hey [Name], thanks so much for hopping on! Really appreciate you making time.
>
> The purpose of this call is simple: we're going to get all the technical stuff out of the way right now - platform access, logins, any two-factor codes - so that when we start building, there's zero friction.
>
> In my experience, the #1 thing that drags projects out is chasing credentials for weeks. We're going to knock that out in the next 15-20 minutes. Sound good?"

[Wait for confirmation]

## Section 2: Quick Expectations (3 min)

### Communication

> "Quick rundown on how we'll stay in touch:"

- **Channel:** "We'll communicate primarily via Slack in your dedicated channel: #[clientname]"
- **Availability:** "I check Slack [X time window] and typically respond within [X hours] during business hours"
- **Updates:** "You'll get progress updates on Tuesdays and Fridays - even if it's just 'still on track'"

### Timeline Overview

> "Here's the high-level timeline:"

- Phase 1: [Description] - [Date range]
- Phase 2: [Description] - [Date range]
- Phase 3: [Description] - [Date range]
- **Target completion:** [Date]

> "I've built in buffer so we should actually finish ahead of that. I'll show you the detailed roadmap in our Project Kickoff call."

---

## Section 3: Platform Walkthrough (15-20 min)

### Setup

> "Okay, this is the main event. I'm going to paste some instructions in the chat. Can you share your screen?"

[Paste platform sign-up instructions in chat]

> "We're going to go through these one by one. For any platforms you already have, we'll just get me added. For new ones, we'll create accounts together."

### For Each Platform

**If client already has account:**
> "Great, you already have [Platform]. Can you log in and add me as a team member / generate an API key?"

[Handle 2FA live if needed]
> "Perfect, you should get a code on your phone right now. Just read it to me."

**If client needs new account:**
> "For [Platform], go to [URL]. Click Sign Up. Use your work email..."

[Walk through step by step]

### Common Issues & Responses

**Forgotten password:**
> "No problem, click 'Forgot Password' and we'll reset it right now."

**2FA code not arriving:**
> "Sometimes there's a delay. Let's wait 30 seconds... If not, we can try the backup option."

**Client doesn't know which account:**
> "Let's check - what email do you usually use for business tools? Try logging in with that."

**Security concerns:**
> "Totally understand. You're not giving me your password - I'm just watching you log in. The credentials go directly into our encrypted vault and only the project team sees them."

### Platforms Checklist

| Platform | Status | Notes |
|----------|--------|-------|
| Make.com / n8n | [ ] | |
| CRM ([Name]) | [ ] | |
| Email tool ([Name]) | [ ] | |

---

## Troubleshooting Guide

### Client Can't Make the Call

**Response:**
> "No problem. I can send you a secure link to submit credentials asynchronously. For 2FA, we'll need to coordinate via Slack when you're available - the codes expire in 30 seconds so we'll need to be online together briefly."

### Critical Access Missing After Call

**Response:**
> "Looks like we still need access to [Platform]. Can you [specific action]? Once I have that, I can start building."

Follow up daily until resolved. This is the #1 project blocker.

### Client Wants to Skip This Call

**Response:**
> "I get it - you're busy. Here's the thing: in my experience, skipping this call adds 2-3 weeks to the project because we end up chasing logins over email. 15 minutes now saves us both a lot of headache. How's [propose time]?"

## Appendix: Quick Reference

### Key Phrases

- "You should get a code on your phone right now - just read it to me"
- "Can you share your screen? We'll walk through this together"
- "This is the #1 thing that drags projects out - let's knock it out now"
- "I've built in buffer so we should actually finish ahead of schedule"

### What Makes This Call Work

1. **Speed** - 15-30 min max, not a project deep-dive
2. **Live 2FA** - Codes expire, do it together
3. **Screen share** - You guide, they execute
4. **Clear scope** - Logistics only, save details for Kickoff
5. **Immediate value** - They feel progress, not bureaucracy
