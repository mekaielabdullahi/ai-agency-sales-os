## Overview: Two-Part ROI Model

### Why Two Parts?

**Part 1: Direct Cost Savings** answers: "How much money do we save?"
- Quantifies eliminated labor costs
- Easy to understand
- Conservative estimate
- Accounting loves this

**Part 2: Revenue Uplift** answers: "How much more money can we make?"
- Quantifies revenue opportunity from reallocated time
- Dramatically increases ROI
- Strategic impact
- Executives love this

**Together, they create an undeniable business case.**

---

### The Formula at a Glance

```
Total Annual Value = Direct Cost Savings + Revenue Uplift

ROI % = ((Total Annual Value - Implementation Cost) / Implementation Cost) × 100

Break-Even = Implementation Cost / Monthly Value
```

---

## Part 1: Direct Cost Savings

**Concept**: Calculate the labor cost of time saved by automation.

### Step-by-Step Process

#### Step 1: Calculate Hours Saved

**Inputs needed from interviews:**
- Time spent on task per person (hours per week)
- Number of employees doing the task
- Percentage of time saved by automation

**Formula:**

```
Total Current Hours Per Week =
    Hours per person per week × Number of employees

Hours Saved Per Week =
    Total Current Hours Per Week × % Time Saved by Automation
```

**Example:**

```
Manual data entry from emails to CRM:
- Each person spends: 10 hours/week
- Number of people: 3 employees
- Automation impact: 90% time saved

Total Current Hours = 10 × 3 = 30 hours/week
Hours Saved = 30 × 0.90 = 27 hours/week
```

---

#### Step 2: Convert Hours to Annual Cost Savings

**Inputs needed:**
- Average annual salary of affected employees
- Hours saved per week (from Step 1)

**Formula:**

```
Hourly Rate = Average Annual Salary ÷ 2,080
    (2,080 = standard working hours per year: 52 weeks × 40 hours)

Weekly Cost Savings = Hours Saved Per Week × Hourly Rate

Annual Cost Savings = Weekly Cost Savings × 52
```

**Example:**

```
Average salary: $50,000/year
Hourly rate: $50,000 ÷ 2,080 = $24.04/hour

Hours saved per week: 27 hours
Weekly savings: 27 × $24.04 = $649/week

Annual Cost Savings: $649 × 52 = $33,748/year
```

---

#### Step 3: Calculate Simple ROI (Cost Savings Only)

**Formula:**

```
ROI % = ((Annual Cost Savings - Implementation Cost) / Implementation Cost) × 100

Break-Even = Implementation Cost ÷ Monthly Cost Savings
```

**Example:**

```
Annual cost savings: $33,748
Implementation cost: $10,000

ROI = (($33,748 - $10,000) / $10,000) × 100 = 237% first-year ROI

Monthly savings: $33,748 ÷ 12 = $2,812
Break-even: $10,000 ÷ $2,812 = 3.6 months
```

**This is good. But wait until you add Part 2...**

---

## Part 2: Revenue Uplift (The Game Changer)

**Concept**: Time saved isn't just about reducing costs. It's about reallocating that time to revenue-generating activities.

**This is what separates good consultants from great consultants.**

### When to Use Revenue Uplift

Use revenue uplift calculation when:
- ✅ Saved time can be reallocated to sales, customer success, or growth activities
- ✅ The team is capacity-constrained (can't handle more customers/leads)
- ✅ There's demonstrated correlation between time and revenue (sales, consulting, services)

Don't use revenue uplift when:
- ❌ Saved time would just reduce headcount (layoffs)
- ❌ No clear revenue-generating activity to reallocate to
- ❌ Market demand is the limiting factor, not capacity

---

### Step-by-Step Process

#### Step 1: Estimate Reallocated Hours

**Not all saved time goes to revenue generation.** Be conservative.

**Conservative estimate: 50%**
**Moderate estimate: 60-70%**
**Aggressive estimate: 80%+**

Use conservative unless client explicitly commits to reallocation strategy.

**Formula:**

```
Revenue-Generating Hours Per Week =
    Hours Saved Per Week × % Reallocated to Revenue Activities
```

**Example:**

```
Hours saved per week: 27 hours
Conservative reallocation: 50%

Revenue-generating hours: 27 × 0.50 = 13.5 hours/week
```

---

#### Step 2: Calculate Value Per Hour

**This is where you need to work with the client. Several methods:**

**Method A: Sales Rep Time-to-Revenue**

For sales teams, ask:
- "How many hours does it take to close an average deal?"
- "What's the average deal value?"

```
Value Per Hour = Average Deal Value ÷ Hours to Close

Example:
Average deal: $5,000
Time to close: 2 hours of actual sales activity

Value per hour = $5,000 ÷ 2 = $2,500/hour
```

**Method B: Billable Hours (Services/Consulting)**

For professional services:
- "What's your billable rate?"
- "What's your utilization rate?"

```
Value Per Hour = Billable Rate × Utilization %

Example:
Billable rate: $200/hour
Typical utilization: 70%

Value per hour = $200 × 0.70 = $140/hour
```

**Method C: Customer Success / Account Management**

For customer-facing roles:
- "How many hours per week do you spend on upsells/renewals?"
- "What's your monthly upsell/renewal revenue?"

```
Value Per Hour = Monthly Upsell Revenue ÷ Hours Spent on Upsells ÷ 4.33

Example:
Monthly upsell revenue: $50,000
Hours per month on upsells: 40 hours

Value per hour = $50,000 ÷ 40 = $1,250/hour
```

**Method D: Revenue Per Employee (Blended)**

When direct attribution is hard:
- Company annual revenue ÷ number of employees ÷ 2,080 = revenue per employee hour
- Use 20-30% of this number (conservative)

```
Company revenue: $5M
Employees: 50
Revenue per employee per hour: $5M ÷ 50 ÷ 2,080 = $48/hour
Conservative value: $48 × 0.25 = $12/hour
```

---

#### Step 3: Calculate Annual Revenue Potential

**Formula:**

```
Weekly Revenue Potential =
    Revenue-Generating Hours Per Week × Value Per Hour

Annual Revenue Potential =
    Weekly Revenue Potential × 52
```

**Example (Sales Rep Scenario):**

```
Revenue-generating hours per week: 13.5 hours
Value per hour: $2,500

Weekly revenue potential: 13.5 × $2,500 = $33,750/week
Annual revenue potential: $33,750 × 52 = $1,755,000/year
```

**Wait, $1.7M seems high. Let's be more conservative...**

---

### Making Revenue Uplift Realistic

**Problem**: The math above assumes 100% conversion of new selling time to revenue. That's unrealistic.

**Solution**: Apply a **conversion efficiency factor**.

**Conservative factors:**
- New leads (cold): 10-20% conversion efficiency
- Existing leads (warm): 30-50% conversion efficiency
- Existing customers (upsell): 50-70% conversion efficiency
- Billable hours: 60-80% conversion efficiency

**Revised Formula:**

```
Realistic Annual Revenue Potential =
    Revenue-Generating Hours × Value Per Hour × Conversion Efficiency × 52
```

**Revised Example:**

```
Revenue-generating hours per week: 13.5
Value per hour (deal value / time): $2,500
Conversion efficiency: 40% (existing warm leads)

Weekly revenue: 13.5 × $2,500 × 0.40 = $13,500
Annual revenue potential: $13,500 × 52 = $702,000
```

**Still massive. This is why revenue uplift is the game changer.**

---

## Combined ROI Calculation

### Putting It All Together

**From our example:**

**Part 1: Direct Cost Savings**
- Annual cost savings: $33,748

**Part 2: Revenue Uplift**
- Annual revenue potential: $702,000

**Total Annual Value**
```
Total = $33,748 + $702,000 = $735,748/year
```

**Implementation Cost**: $10,000

**ROI Calculation:**

```
ROI % = (($735,748 - $10,000) / $10,000) × 100
ROI % = 7,257%

Monthly value: $735,748 ÷ 12 = $61,312
Break-even: $10,000 ÷ $61,312 = 0.16 months (~ 5 days!)
```

**See the difference?**
- Cost savings only: 237% ROI, 3.6 month break-even
- Cost savings + revenue uplift: 7,257% ROI, 5 day break-even

**This is how you get clients excited.**

## ROI Presentation Format

### The "Money Slide" Table

Present ROI in a clear table format:

| Solution | Investment | Direct Savings | Revenue Uplift | Total Value | ROI % | Payback |
|----------|-----------|----------------|----------------|-------------|-------|---------|
| Automated Lead Capture & CRM Sync | $10,000 | $33,748 | $702,000 | $735,748 | 7,257% | 5 days |
| AI-Powered Lead Scoring | $15,000 | $18,200 | $250,000 | $268,200 | 1,688% | 20 days |
| Automated Customer Onboarding | $8,000 | $28,600 | $0 | $28,600 | 258% | 3.4 months |
| **TOTAL** | **$33,000** | **$80,548** | **$952,000** | **$1,032,548** | **3,029%** | **12 days** |

**This is your most powerful slide.**

---

### Narrative Format

Also tell the story in narrative form:

**Example:**

"By implementing automated lead capture and CRM synchronization, we'll save your team approximately 27 hours per week currently spent on manual data entry. At your average salary of $50,000, that's $33,748 per year in direct labor cost savings.

But here's where it gets really interesting: those 27 hours aren't going away - they're going back to your team. If we conservatively assume that 50% of that time (13.5 hours per week) gets reallocated to actual selling, and based on your average deal value of $5,000 taking 2 hours to close, that's $2,500 of value per hour.

With a conservative 40% conversion rate on warm leads, that 13.5 hours per week could generate approximately $13,500 in additional weekly revenue, or $702,000 per year.

Combined, we're looking at $735,748 in annual value from a $10,000 investment - a 7,257% ROI with a payback period of just 5 days."

## Real-World Examples

### Example 1: Sales Team - Automated Lead Management

**Current State:**
- 3 sales reps
- Each spends 10 hours/week on manual lead data entry
- Average salary: $60,000/year ($28.85/hour)
- Average deal: $8,000
- Time to close: 3 hours
- Close rate on warm leads: 35%

**Solution:** Automated lead capture, CRM sync, AI scoring

**Cost:** $12,000 implementation

**Calculation:**

```
PART 1: DIRECT COST SAVINGS
Current hours: 3 people × 10 hours = 30 hours/week
Automation saves: 90% of manual work = 27 hours/week saved
Labor cost: 27 hours × $28.85 = $779/week
Annual savings: $779 × 52 = $40,508/year

PART 2: REVENUE UPLIFT
Reallocated hours: 27 × 50% = 13.5 hours/week to selling
Value per hour: $8,000 ÷ 3 hours = $2,667/hour
Conversion factor: 35%
Weekly revenue: 13.5 × $2,667 × 0.35 = $12,600
Annual revenue: $12,600 × 52 = $655,200/year

TOTAL ANNUAL VALUE: $40,508 + $655,200 = $695,708

ROI: (($695,708 - $12,000) / $12,000) × 100 = 5,697%
Payback: $12,000 ÷ ($695,708 ÷ 12) = 0.2 months (6 days)
```

---

### Example 2: Customer Success - Automated Onboarding

**Current State:**
- 2 CS managers
- Each spends 15 hours/week on manual onboarding tasks
- Average salary: $55,000/year ($26.44/hour)
- CS team handles upsells worth ~$30,000/month
- Spend ~20 hours/month on upsell conversations

**Solution:** Automated onboarding workflows, self-service portal

**Cost:** $8,000 implementation

**Calculation:**

```
PART 1: DIRECT COST SAVINGS
Current hours: 2 people × 15 hours = 30 hours/week
Automation saves: 80% = 24 hours/week saved
Labor cost: 24 hours × $26.44 = $635/week
Annual savings: $635 × 52 = $33,000/year

PART 2: REVENUE UPLIFT
Reallocated hours: 24 × 60% = 14.4 hours/week to upsells
(higher % because it's strategic work they want to do)
Current upsell value per hour: $30,000/month ÷ 20 hours = $1,500/hour
Weekly revenue: 14.4 hours × $1,500 = $21,600/week
Annual revenue: $21,600 × 52 = $1,123,200/year

TOTAL ANNUAL VALUE: $33,000 + $1,123,200 = $1,156,200

ROI: (($1,156,200 - $8,000) / $8,000) × 100 = 14,352%
Payback: $8,000 ÷ ($1,156,200 ÷ 12) = 0.08 months (2.5 days)
```

---

### Example 3: Operations - Automated Reporting

**Current State:**
- 1 operations manager
- Spends 8 hours/week creating manual reports
- Salary: $70,000/year ($33.65/hour)
- No direct revenue impact (pure efficiency gain)

**Solution:** Automated dashboard and reporting system

**Cost:** $5,000 implementation

**Calculation:**

```
PART 1: DIRECT COST SAVINGS
Hours saved: 8 hours/week
Labor cost: 8 × $33.65 = $269/week
Annual savings: $269 × 52 = $13,988/year

PART 2: REVENUE UPLIFT
N/A - No revenue-generating reallocation
(Manager will use time for strategic planning, but hard to quantify)

TOTAL ANNUAL VALUE: $13,988

ROI: (($13,988 - $5,000) / $5,000) × 100 = 180%
Payback: $5,000 ÷ ($13,988 ÷ 12) = 4.3 months
```

**Note:** Still a good ROI, but notice the difference when revenue uplift isn't applicable.

## Common Mistakes & How to Avoid Them

### Mistake 1: Only Calculating Cost Savings

**Why it's bad:** You leave the most compelling part of the story on the table.

**Fix:** Always ask: "What could this team do with the time we're saving them?"

---

### Mistake 2: Unrealistic Revenue Conversion Assumptions

**Why it's bad:** CFO will immediately discount your numbers if they seem inflated.

**Example of unrealistic:**
- Assuming 100% of saved time goes to revenue work
- Assuming 100% conversion of new selling time to deals
- Not accounting for market constraints

**Fix:**
- Use 50% reallocation as default (conservative)
- Apply conversion efficiency factors (30-50%)
- Validate assumptions with client

---

### Mistake 3: Not Validating Time Estimates

**Why it's bad:** "I think it takes about 10 hours" could actually be 3 or 30.

**Fix:**
- Ask for specific time tracking data if available
- Have them estimate together with you on the call
- Cross-reference with multiple people
- Use ranges (8-12 hours) if uncertain

---

### Mistake 4: Using Fully-Loaded Cost vs. Salary

**Why it's bad:** Inconsistent methodology leads to confusion.

**Guideline:**
- For **labor cost savings**: Use salary ÷ 2,080 (clean, simple)
- For **total company cost**: Use fully-loaded cost (salary + benefits + overhead, usually 1.3-1.5x salary)

**Be consistent** and note which method you're using.

---

### Mistake 5: Forgetting About Implementation Time

**Why it's bad:** ROI calculation should account for when value actually starts.

**Fix:**
- Note implementation timeline in ROI summary
- Adjust break-even calculation if implementation takes >1 month
- For long implementations (3+ months), consider phased ROI

**Example:**

```
Implementation timeline: 8 weeks
Value starts: Month 3
First-year value: $735,748 × (10 months / 12) = $613,123
Adjusted ROI: (($613,123 - $10,000) / $10,000) × 100 = 6,031%
```

Still compelling, just more accurate.

---

### Mistake 6: Not Documenting Assumptions

**Why it's bad:** Client finance team will question your numbers. If you can't show your work, you lose credibility.

**Fix:** Document all assumptions in your ROI calculation:

**Example Documentation:**

```
ROI CALCULATION ASSUMPTIONS

Time Savings:
- Current manual time: 10 hours per person per week (validated in interview with Jane Smith, 1/15/25)
- Number of people affected: 3 (confirmed by VP Sales)
- Automation impact: 90% time saved (conservative, could be 95%)
- Total hours saved: 27 hours/week

Cost Basis:
- Average salary: $50,000/year (provided by HR)
- Hourly rate: $24.04 ($50,000 ÷ 2,080)
- Labor cost calculation: 27 hours × $24.04 × 52 weeks

Revenue Uplift:
- Reallocation to revenue work: 50% (conservative assumption)
- Average deal value: $5,000 (from CRM data)
- Time to close: 2 hours (estimate from Sales VP)
- Conversion rate: 40% (warm leads, historical data)
- Calculation method: Hours × (Deal Value / Time to Close) × Conversion % × 52

Implementation:
- Implementation cost: $10,000 (quoted)
- Timeline: 3 weeks to go-live
- Ongoing costs: $500/month for AI API calls (included in ROI)
```

---

### Mistake 7: Not Stress-Testing with Sensitivity Analysis

**Why it's bad:** What if your assumptions are off by 50%?

**Fix:** Show best case, realistic case, and conservative case.

**Example:**

| Scenario | Assumptions | Annual Value | ROI % | Payback |
|----------|-------------|--------------|-------|---------|
| **Best Case** | 70% time reallocation, 50% conversion | $1,100,000 | 10,900% | 3 days |
| **Realistic** | 50% time reallocation, 40% conversion | $735,748 | 7,257% | 5 days |
| **Conservative** | 30% time reallocation, 30% conversion | $360,000 | 3,500% | 10 days |

**Even in the conservative case, it's a no-brainer investment.**
