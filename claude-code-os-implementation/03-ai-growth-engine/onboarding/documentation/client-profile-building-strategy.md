# Client Profile Building Strategy
## Systematic Approach to Building Rich, Actionable Client Profiles

**Created**: November 28, 2025
**Department**: AI Growth Engine
**Purpose**: Create a repeatable system for building comprehensive client profiles that drive effective sales outreach

---

## 🎯 STRATEGY OVERVIEW

### The Goal:
Build client profiles that are **rich enough** to enable high-conversion outreach without being **so detailed** they take forever to create.

### The Balance:
- **Minimum Viable Profile (MVP)**: 5-10 minutes to create, enough to start outreach
- **Enhanced Profile**: 20-30 minutes, deep personalization
- **Living Profile**: Continuously updated as you learn more

### Core Principle:
**"Progressive Enhancement"** - Start minimal, add depth over time as the relationship progresses.

**Do this**:
- Monday: Research 10 profiles
- Tuesday: AI analysis on all 10
- Wednesday: Draft 5Q openings
- Thursday: Execute outreach

---

### 2. **Use Templates Religiously**
Copy-paste templates, fill in blanks, don't start from scratch each time.

---

### 3. **Set Time Limits**
Quick Capture = 10 min MAX
Sales-Ready = 30 min MAX

Perfect is the enemy of done.

---

### 4. **Tag Everything**

- Industry (construction, SaaS, services)
- Priority (Tier 1/2/3/4)
- Status (prospect, contacted, qualified, etc.)

Tagging enables filtering and prioritization.

---

### 5. **Review > Create**
Spend more time reviewing/updating existing profiles than creating new ones.

Weekly: Review top 10 active prospects
Monthly: Audit all profiles for freshness
