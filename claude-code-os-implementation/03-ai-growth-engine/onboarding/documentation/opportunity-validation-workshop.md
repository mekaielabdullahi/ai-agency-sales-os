# Opportunity Validation Workshop Guide
## Co-Creating the Audit Roadmap with Your Client

**Purpose**: Run a collaborative workshop to validate AI opportunities with stakeholders before final roadmap creation.

**Critical Insight from Liam Ottley**: By the end of this workshop, you're no longer "pitching" them solutions - you've co-created a plan they already own and believe in.

**When to Use**: After identifying AI opportunities, before creating final roadmap and presentation.

## Why Validation Workshops Matter

### The Problem Without Validation

**Traditional audit approach:**
1. Consultant does interviews
2. Consultant identifies opportunities in isolation
3. Consultant presents final recommendations
4. Client has concerns/objections
5. Consultant defends recommendations
6. Trust erodes, deal stalls

**Validation Workshop Approach:**
1. Consultant does interviews
2. Consultant identifies DRAFT opportunities
3. **Consultant and client workshop together to validate/refine**
4. Client co-creates final priorities
5. Client owns the roadmap
6. Trust deepens, deal accelerates

---

### The Benefits

**For the Client:**
- ✅ Feel heard and involved
- ✅ Surface concerns early when they can be addressed
- ✅ Bring organizational context you don't have
- ✅ Take ownership of the solution
- ✅ Build internal buy-in during the process

**For You:**
- ✅ Validate assumptions before final presentation
- ✅ Uncover hidden complexities or political issues
- ✅ Build stronger relationship and trust
- ✅ Reduce risk of surprise objections later
- ✅ Turn client into co-creator and advocate

**Key Outcome**: By the end, they're not buying YOUR plan - they're implementing THEIR plan that you helped them create.

## Workshop Preparation

### 1. Pre-Workshop Materials to Prepare

**Opportunity Matrix (Draft)**

Create visual 2×2 matrix with ALL opportunities identified:
- X-axis: Business Impact (Low → High)
- Y-axis: Implementation Effort (Low → High)
- Plot each opportunity as a labeled dot/card

**4 Quadrants:**
- Quick Wins: High impact, low effort
- Big Swings: High impact, high effort
- Nice-to-Haves: Low impact, low effort
- Deprioritize: Low impact, high effort

**Opportunity Cards**

For each opportunity, prepare a 1-slide summary:
- **Name**: Clear, business-focused name
- **Problem it solves**: Reference pain points from interviews
- **How it works**: 2-3 sentence explanation
- **Impact**: Time saved, revenue potential, customer experience
- **Effort**: Complexity, timeline, integration points
- **Risks**: What could go wrong
- **Dependencies**: What needs to happen first

**Interview Insights Summary**

1-page summary of key findings:
- Number of interviews conducted
- Roles interviewed
- Top 5 pain points mentioned (with frequency)
- Current cost of inefficiency
- Stakeholder quotes that stood out

**Current State Maps**

Visual process maps for critical workflows:
- Show steps, systems, handoffs
- Highlight bottlenecks and manual steps
- Annotate with time costs

---

### 2. Who to Invite

**Required Attendees:**
- Primary stakeholder/decision maker
- Department heads affected by opportunities
- 1-2 end-users who were interviewed
- Technical lead (if applicable)

**Optional:**
- Finance/CFO (if budget approval needed)
- IT/Security (if integrations complex)
- Change management/HR (if organizational impact)

**Size:** 4-8 people (max 10)
- Too few: Missing perspectives
- Too many: Can't make decisions

---

### 3. Logistics

**Format:**
- Virtual: Use Miro or FigJam for collaborative canvas
- In-person: Use whiteboard or printed matrix with sticky notes

**Duration:**
- 60-90 minutes (ideal)
- Max 2 hours

**Tools Needed:**
- Collaborative whiteboard (Miro, FigJam, Mural)
- OR Physical whiteboard + markers
- Opportunity cards (digital or printed)
- Interview summary doc
- Note-taker (you or a colleague)

**Pre-Work (Send 2 Days Before):**
- Workshop agenda

## Workshop Structure

### Phase 1: Welcome & Frame (5 minutes)

**Your Opening:**

"Thank you all for making time for this. Over the past [X] weeks, I've had the privilege of interviewing [Y] people across your team - from [roles]. I heard about your workflows, your pain points, and your goals.

Today's purpose is NOT for me to pitch you solutions. It's for us to collaborate and make sure I understood correctly, validate that the opportunities I identified actually make sense, and prioritize them together.

By the end of this session, we should have a clear, agreed-upon roadmap that feels right for your organization.

There are no wrong answers. If something I suggest doesn't make sense, speak up. If I missed something important, tell me. This is a working session."

**Set Ground Rules:**
- All perspectives welcome
- Challenge assumptions
- Focus on problems first, solutions second
- We're building this together

---

### Phase 2: Interview Insights Recap (10 minutes)

**Share What You Heard:**

"Before we dive into opportunities, let me share what I learned from the interviews..."

**Present:**
1. **Who you talked to**: [X stakeholders, Y end-users, roles]
2. **Top pain points** mentioned (ranked by frequency):
   - Pain point #1: [description] - mentioned by X people
   - Pain point #2: [description] - mentioned by Y people
   - Pain point #3: [description] - mentioned by Z people

3. **Quantified impact**:
   - [X] hours per week spent on manual tasks
   - $[Y] estimated monthly cost of inefficiency
   - [Z] opportunities lost due to [bottleneck]

4. **Powerful quotes** from your team:
   > "[Exact quote from interview]"
   > "[Another quote]"

**Ask for Validation:**

"Does this align with how you see things? What did I miss? What should I emphasize more?"

**Listen and adjust.** If they disagree with something, explore why.

---

### Phase 3: Opportunity Review (30 minutes)

**Go through each opportunity systematically.**

For each one, present:

**1. The Opportunity**: [Name]

**2. What problem it solves**:
"In the interviews, [X people] mentioned [pain point]. For example, [specific quote or story]. This opportunity addresses that by [solution]."

**3. How it works** (keep it simple):
"Here's how this would work: [2-3 sentence explanation, avoid jargon]"

**4. Expected impact**:
- Time saved: [X hours per week]
- Cost savings: $[Y per year]
- Revenue potential: $[Z per year] (if applicable)
- Customer experience improvement: [description]

**5. Implementation effort**:
- Technical complexity: [Low/Medium/High]
- Timeline: [X weeks]
- Integration points: [List systems]
- Dependencies: [What needs to happen first]

**6. Risks & concerns**:
- What could go wrong: [List]
- Mitigation plan: [How to address]

**7. Where it sits on the matrix**:
"Based on [high impact] and [medium effort], I plotted this as a [Quick Win / Big Swing]."

**Then ask:**

- "Does this opportunity resonate with you?"
- "Did I understand the problem correctly?"
- "What am I missing about implementation complexity?"
- "What concerns do you have?"
- "Would your team embrace this or resist it? Why?"

**Let them react. Take notes on everything.**

---

### Phase 4: Interactive Prioritization (20 minutes)

**Now that they've seen all opportunities, it's time to prioritize together.**

**Technique 1: Dot Voting (Simple)**

Give each person 3 "votes" (literal dots, or emojis in Miro):
- "Put your dots on the opportunities you think are most important"
- Tally the votes
- Discuss: "Why did [Opportunity X] get so many votes?"

**Technique 2: Forced Ranking**

"If you could only do 3 of these in the next 6 months, which 3 and in what order?"

Have each person share their top 3. Look for consensus.

**Technique 3: Matrix Adjustment (Collaborative)**

"Do you agree with where I placed this on the matrix? Or would you move it?"

Let them drag opportunities around on the Miro board or whiteboard.
- "Should this be higher or lower impact?"
- "Is this more or less effort than I estimated?"

**Listen for emerging consensus:**
- Which opportunities do multiple people champion?
- Which ones have concerns?
- Where do priorities cluster?

**Goal**: Get alignment on top 3-5 opportunities to prioritize.

---

### Phase 5: Reality Check (15 minutes)

**Now pressure-test the top priorities.**

**For each top priority, ask:**

**Question Set 1: Organizational Readiness**
- "Who would lead this initiative internally?"
- "Do we have the right people to implement this?"
- "What concerns would [other stakeholders not in room] have?"
- "How has your team responded to change in the past?"

**Question Set 2: Hidden Complexity**
- "What am I not seeing about [specific integration/system]?"
- "Are there political or organizational dynamics I should understand?"
- "What failed projects should we learn from?"
- "What dependencies am I underestimating?"

**Question Set 3: Resource Constraints**
- "What's your realistic timeline for this?"
- "Do you have budget approved or need to get approval?"
- "Who else needs to be involved in decisions?"
- "What's your team's bandwidth right now?"

**Listen carefully.** This is where you learn:
- What opportunities might be harder than you thought
- What to de-prioritize
- What to phase differently
- How to position the roadmap for success

**Adjust priorities based on what you hear.**

---

### Phase 6: Finalize Top Priorities (10 minutes)

**Synthesize and confirm.**

"Based on our discussion, here's what I'm hearing for top priorities:

**Phase 1 (Quick Wins - First 30 days):**
1. [Opportunity A] - High impact, low complexity, team is excited
2. [Opportunity B] - Solves biggest pain point, quick implementation

**Phase 2 (Scale-Up - Months 2-3):**
1. [Opportunity C] - Builds on Phase 1, medium complexity
2. [Opportunity D] - Higher revenue impact, needs Phase 1 complete

**Phase 3 (Strategic - Months 4-6):**
1. [Opportunity E] - Transformational, requires Phases 1-2 foundation

**Deprioritized (for now):**
- [Opportunity F] - Good idea but team capacity concerns
- [Opportunity G] - Lower impact, defer to Phase 4

Does this feel right? What would you change?"

**Get explicit agreement.** This is critical.

**Ask:**
- "Does this roadmap align with your strategic goals?"
- "Can you see yourself championing this internally?"
- "What would make you more confident in this plan?"

---

### Phase 7: Next Steps (5 minutes)

**Confirm what happens next:**

"Here's what I'll do:
1. Update the opportunity matrix based on today's feedback
2. Build out detailed plans for the Phase 1 Quick Wins
3. Create ROI projections with conservative/realistic/optimistic scenarios
4. Prepare the final presentation for [date]
5. Send you a summary of today's session by [date]

And from your side:
- [Stakeholder] will review with [other team] and share any concerns
- You'll provide [data we need] by [date]
- We'll schedule final presentation for [date] with [decision makers]

Sound good?"

**Thank them:**

"Thank you for being so collaborative and transparent. This is exactly the kind of partnership that ensures we build the right solution for you, not just what looks good on paper."

---

## Facilitation Techniques

### 1. The "Yes, And" Technique

When they raise concerns, don't defend - build on them.

❌ **Don't:** "No, actually that won't be a problem because..."

✅ **Do:** "That's a great point. What if we addressed that by [modification]? Would that work?"

**Example:**

Them: "I'm worried our team won't adopt a new CRM after the last one failed."

You: "That's absolutely valid. What if instead of replacing the CRM, we build automation around your existing one? We keep the tool they know, just eliminate the manual work. Would that feel safer?"

---

### 2. The "Make Me Smart" Technique

When you don't understand their concern, ask them to teach you.

"Help me understand. What am I missing about [topic]?"

"Walk me through why that would be problematic."

"Educate me on [their domain knowledge]."

This does two things:
1. You actually learn the context you're missing
2. They feel valued and expert

---

### 3. The "Third-Person" Technique

When there's disagreement, externalize it.

❌ **Don't:** "I disagree..."

✅ **Do:** "What would [CFO / end-users / customers] say about this?"

Shifts from you-vs-them to us-figuring-it-out-together.

---

### 4. The "Silence" Technique

After asking a hard question, wait. Don't fill the silence.

Often the real answer comes AFTER the first answer.

**Example:**

You: "What concerns do you have about this?"
Them: "Oh, none really, looks good."
You: [Wait 5 seconds]
Them: "Actually... I'm a little worried about how IT will react. They're already stretched thin."
← **The real concern**

---

### 5. The "Devil's Advocate" Technique

Help them surface concerns by playing devil's advocate.

"Let me push back on this for a second. Someone might say [concern]. How would you respond?"

This invites them to defend the opportunity, which builds ownership.

---

## Handling Objections & Concerns

### Objection 1: "This seems too complex"

**What they're really saying:** "I don't understand how it works" or "I'm worried about change"

**Response:**

"Let's break it down. What part feels complex? [Listen]

What if we simplified the first version to just [core feature]? Get that working, prove value, then expand?"

**Technique:** Reduce scope, phase implementation

---

### Objection 2: "We tried something like this before and it failed"

**What they're really saying:** "I'm scared of repeating past mistakes"

**Response:**

"That's really important context. What went wrong last time? [Listen carefully]

How is this different? [Highlight differences]

What would need to be true for you to feel confident this time?"

**Technique:** Learn from failure, address root causes

---

### Objection 3: "Our team won't use this"

**What they're really saying:** "Change management concerns" or "Past adoption issues"

**Response:**

"You know your team better than I do. What would make them embrace this vs. resist it?

[Listen]

What if we involved [key team member] in the design? Made them champions?"

**Technique:** Co-design with end-users, identify champions

---

### Objection 4: "This is too expensive"

**What they're really saying:** "I don't see the ROI" or "Budget constraints"

**Response:**

"Let's look at the numbers. You're currently spending [X hours per week] on [task], which costs [Y] per year.

This investment pays back in [Z months].

What ROI threshold would make this a no-brainer for you?"

**Technique:** Re-anchor on cost of doing nothing, show break-even

---

### Objection 5: "We don't have time to implement this right now"

**What they're really saying:** "Priorities conflict" or "Capacity constraints"

**Response:**

"I hear you. What's taking priority right now? [Listen]

Could we start with just [smallest Quick Win]? It's [X weeks] to implement and frees up [Y hours per week].

Or should we plan this for [next quarter] when things calm down?"

**Technique:** Reduce scope or adjust timing, don't force

---

### Objection 6: "I need to think about it"

**What they're really saying:** "I'm not convinced yet" or "I need to socialize internally"

**Response:**

"Absolutely. What specifically do you want to think through?

[Listen]

What information would help you decide? Who else needs to weigh in?"

**Technique:** Surface the real blocker, offer to help address it

---

## Documenting Outcomes

### During Workshop

**Assign a dedicated note-taker** (not you - you're facilitating).

**Capture:**
- Which opportunities resonated most (and with whom)
- Which opportunities had concerns (and what concerns)
- Organizational context shared (past failures, politics, constraints)
- Modified priorities or phasing
- New opportunities suggested
- Explicit agreements on roadmap

---

## Workshop Success Metrics

A successful validation workshop results in:

- [ ] All opportunities reviewed and feedback captured
- [ ] Clear consensus on top 3-5 priorities
- [ ] Concerns surfaced and addressed (or acknowledged for roadmap)
- [ ] Roadmap phases agreed upon
- [ ] Key stakeholders bought in and championing
- [ ] Organizational context understood (politics, capacity, history)
- [ ] Client feels ownership of plan ("our roadmap" not "your proposal")
- [ ] Technical/organizational risks identified early
- [ ] Next steps and responsibilities clear
- [ ] Trust and partnership deepened

---

## Summary: The Workshop Power Framework

**Before:**
- Prepare draft matrix and opportunity cards
- Invite right mix of stakeholders and end-users
- Send pre-read materials 2 days before

**During:**
- Frame as collaboration, not pitch
- Present opportunities transparently (including risks)
- Facilitate prioritization interactively
- Surface and address concerns in real-time
- Get explicit agreement on priorities

**After:**
- Document everything in audit.json
- Send summary email within 24 hours
- Update roadmap based on feedback
- Prepare final presentation with co-created plan

**The Outcome:**
By the end of the workshop, the client has co-created the roadmap with you. They own it. They championed it. You're no longer selling - you're implementing together.

This is the difference between an audit that stalls and one that closes.
