**Subject:** Your AriseGroup Onboarding - Next Steps Inside

Hi {{firstName}},

Great to have you on board! Here's everything you need to get started with your {{projectType}} project.

## Your Next Steps

### 1. Schedule Your Logistics Onboarding Call (15-30 min)

This is where we'll collect all the platform access we need to start building. We'll handle any two-factor authentication live on the call so you don't have to worry about codes later.

**[Schedule Your Call →]({{calendarLink}})**

### 2. Review the Attached Platform Guide

I've attached a PDF with the platforms we'll need access to. Don't worry about setting anything up beforehand - we'll walk through everything together on the call.

### 3. Join Our Slack Workspace

You'll receive a Slack invite shortly. This is where all project communication will happen. We're available for quick questions during our daily window (12-2pm PT).

## What to Expect

- **Logistics Call:** We collect platform access and handle 2FA
- **Kickoff Call (60 min):** We present your audit findings and walk through the solutions
- **Build Phase:** We build your systems with 2x weekly progress updates
- **Delivery:** You receive a complete delivery report with all documentation

## Communication Protocol

- **Progress Updates:** Tuesdays and Fridays
- **Slack Availability:** 12-2pm PT daily
- **Urgent Issues:** Flag with "URGENT" in Slack for priority response

If you have any questions before our call, reply to this email or reach out on Slack.

Looking forward to building with you!

Best,
The AriseGroup Team
