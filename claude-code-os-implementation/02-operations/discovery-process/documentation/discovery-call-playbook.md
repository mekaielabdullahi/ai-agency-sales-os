## The 5-Question Framework

Use these questions **in sequence**—they build on each other to create a complete picture.

---

### **Question 1: What is the biggest problem in your business right now?**

**Purpose:** Identify the primary pain point in their own words

**How to ask:**
- "What's the biggest problem in your business right now?"
- "If you could fix one thing in your operations, what would it be?"
- "What keeps you up at night about [their department/business]?"

**What to listen for:**
- Specific, concrete problems (not vague complaints)
- Whether it's operational, revenue-related, or strategic
- Passion/emotion—urgency in their voice

**Follow-up questions if needed:**
- "Can you give me an example of when this problem showed up recently?"
- "How does this impact your team's day-to-day work?"
- "Is this affecting just one department or multiple areas?"

**Note-taking focus:**
- Exact words they use (quote them)
- Specific examples or stories
- Emotional indicators (frustration, urgency, resignation)

---

### **Question 2: How much is this problem costing the business per month?**

**Purpose:** Quantify the financial impact and establish ROI baseline

**How to ask:**
- "How much is this problem costing the business per month?"
- "If you had to estimate, what's the monthly impact of this issue—either in lost revenue or wasted time/resources?"
- "What's this costing you in terms of [revenue/efficiency/opportunities]?"

**What to listen for:**
- Dollar amounts (even rough estimates)
- If they can't quantify: time lost, deals missed, customer churn
- Whether the cost is growing or stable

**Alternative approaches when they can't quantify dollars:**
- "How many hours per week does your team spend on this?"
- "How many [customers/deals/patients] are you losing because of this?"
- "What's the impact on staff morale or turnover?"
- Calculate for them: "If your team is spending 10 hours/week on this at $X/hour, that's roughly $Y per month in lost productivity."

**Note-taking focus:**
- Dollar amounts (or time converted to dollars)
- Sources of cost (lost revenue, wasted labor, missed opportunities)
- Their confidence level in the estimate

---

### **Question 3: How long have you had this problem for?**

**Purpose:** Reveal urgency and measure accumulated cost/pain

**How to ask:**
- "How long have you had this problem for?"
- "When did this start becoming a consistent issue?"
- "How long have you noticed this cropping up?"

**What to listen for:**
- Duration (months? years?)
- Whether it's getting worse over time
- Previous attempts to solve it

**Follow-up questions:**
- "Have you tried anything to fix it before? What happened?"
- "Is it getting worse, staying the same, or improving?"
- "What triggered you to look for a solution now?"

**Note-taking focus:**
- Timeline (start date, duration)
- Accumulated cost calculation (monthly cost × duration)
- Urgency indicators

**Insight to share (optional):**
"So if this has been costing you $X/month for Y months, that's $Z in accumulated cost. Imagine recapturing that going forward."

---

### **Question 4: If you do nothing, what does the next 6 to 12 months look like?**

**Purpose:** Explore consequences of inaction and drive urgency

**How to ask:**
- "If you do nothing about this problem, what does the next 6 to 12 months look like?"
- "Walk me through what happens if this continues unchecked."
- "If this issue persists, how will it affect your [goals/team/growth]?"

**What to listen for:**
- Worsening conditions (scaling pain)
- Risk of competitive disadvantage
- Impact on strategic goals or growth plans
- Personal consequences (stress, reputation, job security)

**Follow-up questions:**
- "How would that affect your ability to [hit targets/serve customers/retain staff]?"
- "What's at stake if this isn't resolved?"
- "Are there any upcoming deadlines or events where this could become critical?"

**Note-taking focus:**
- Future consequences (short-term and long-term)
- Strategic risks or missed opportunities
- Emotional weight of inaction

---

### **Question 5: If I had a magic wand and could build the perfect solution to fix this problem, what would that look like?**

**Purpose:** Uncover ideal outcomes and solution requirements

**How to ask:**
- "If I had a magic wand and could build the perfect solution to fix this problem, what would that look like?"
- "Describe your ideal state—what changes, what stays the same?"
- "If we solve this perfectly, what does success look like 6 months from now?"

**What to listen for:**
- Specific outcomes they want to achieve
- Features or capabilities they value most
- Constraints or non-negotiables
- Unrealistic expectations (so you can manage them)

**Follow-up questions:**
- "What would be different about your day-to-day operations?"
- "How would your team's workflow change?"
- "What metrics would you use to measure success?"
- "Are there any existing tools or processes you want to keep?"

**Note-taking focus:**
- Must-have outcomes vs. nice-to-haves
- Success metrics they care about
- Integration requirements or constraints
- Unrealistic expectations to address later

## Objection Handling

### Common Objections & Responses

---

#### **"We don't have budget right now."**

**Response:**
"I understand. Based on what you shared, this is costing you about $X/month. Even a partial solution that saves you half of that would pay for itself quickly. Would it make sense to explore options that fit within your current budget?"

**Alternative:**
"When does your next budget cycle open up? Let's stay in touch so we're top of mind when funding becomes available."

---

#### **"We need to think about it."**

**Response:**
"Absolutely—this is an important decision. To help you think it through, what specific concerns or questions do you still have?"

**Follow-up:**
"What would need to be true for this to be a clear 'yes' for you?"

---

#### **"We're already working with another vendor."**

**Response:**
"That's great—what's working well with them? And what gaps or frustrations are you still experiencing?"

**Positioning:**
"We often work alongside existing tools to fill specific gaps. Based on what you've shared, it sounds like [specific pain] isn't being addressed—is that accurate?"

---

#### **"This sounds expensive."**

**Response:**
"I hear you. Let me frame it differently: You mentioned this is costing you $X/month. Our solution typically pays for itself within [timeframe] by eliminating that cost. Does that change how you're thinking about the investment?"

**Alternative:**
"What ROI would you need to see to make this a no-brainer?"

---

#### **"We've tried automation before and it didn't work."**

**Response:**
"I appreciate you sharing that—it's important context. What went wrong last time? What would need to be different for this to succeed?"

**Positioning:**
"One thing we do differently is [unique approach]. That tends to address the issues you experienced before."

---

#### **"We don't have time to implement this right now."**

**Response:**
"I totally understand bandwidth is tight. Here's the thing: based on what you shared, this problem is costing you [X hours/week or $Y/month]. The longer you wait, the more it costs. What if we phased the implementation so it's less disruptive?"

**Alternative:**
"What would need to change for this to become a priority?"
