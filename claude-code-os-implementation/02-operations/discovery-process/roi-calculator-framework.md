# ROI Calculator Framework

**Created:** December 29, 2025
**Origin:** Strategy session with Chris
**Purpose:** Standardize how we calculate and communicate ROI to clients

---

## The Core Insight

Without knowing the client's actual numbers, we're **shooting in the dark** with what to build:
- How many hours are people spending on tasks?
- How much money is going where?
- What's the daily operating cost?

The ROI Calculator solves this by:
1. Forcing us to gather real baseline metrics
2. Qualifying clients on their data maturity
3. Building trust through the discovery process itself
4. Making the business case undeniable with their own numbers

---

## Qualification Path: The First Question

**"Do you know your daily operating cost?"**

### Path A: They Don't Know (Most Clients)

**What this means:**
- They're flying blind operationally
- Our discovery process is MORE valuable (we help them see their business)
- Longer sales cycle but deeper engagement
- They often discover problems they didn't know they had

**Sales Script Direction:**
- "That's totally normal - most businesses don't track this"
- "Part of what we do is help you understand these numbers first"
- "Before we build anything, we need to know what to optimize"
- "The discovery process itself is valuable - you'll learn things about your business"

**Process:**
1. Help them gather the data (time tracking, cost analysis)
2. Build the baseline together
3. Identify opportunities WITH them (collaborative)
4. ROI becomes obvious because we discovered it together

### Path B: They Know Their Numbers (Rare Breed)

**What this means:**
- Sophisticated operator
- Faster sales cycle
- Clear ROI conversation
- They already know their problems - just need solutions

**Sales Script Direction:**
- "That's rare - you actually know your numbers"
- "Great, that means we can move faster"
- "Let's plug your numbers into our ROI model and see the opportunity"
- "You probably already know where the waste is"

**Process:**
1. Collect their existing metrics
2. Validate accuracy quickly
3. Run through ROI calculator
4. Present clear business case

## The ROI Calculator (Spreadsheet Model)

### Daily Operating Cost Breakdown

The foundation of the ROI calculator. Client fills this out in a shared spreadsheet:

| Category | Line Items | Notes |
|----------|------------|-------|
| **Rent/Facilities** | Building rent, storage, utilities | Monthly ÷ 30 |
| **Utilities** | Electric, gas, water, internet, phone | Monthly ÷ 30 |
| **Payroll** | All employee salaries + benefits | Annual ÷ 365 |
| **Insurance** | Liability, building, vehicle, workers comp | Annual ÷ 365 |
| **Vehicles** | Truck payments, fuel, maintenance | Monthly ÷ 30 |
| **Software** | All subscriptions (check for duplicates!) | Monthly ÷ 30 |
| **Inventory/Materials** | Average daily material cost | From purchasing records |

**Key insight from Chris:** "At the end of the day, they need to know their numbers too. And if they don't know their numbers, then we're doing them a disservice."

### Required Inputs

| Category | Metric | How to Get It |
|----------|--------|---------------|
| **Labor** | Hourly cost per role | Salary ÷ 2,080 hrs |
| **Labor** | Hours/week per task | Time tracking or estimation |
| **Revenue** | Average deal size | Sales records |
| **Revenue** | Deals per month | CRM or manual count |
| **Cost** | Daily operating cost | Bills + payroll + overhead ÷ 30 |
| **Waste** | Lost revenue (delays, errors) | Customer churn, refunds |
| **Waste** | Inventory losses | Untracked parts, damaged goods |
| **Efficiency** | Time on low-value tasks | Process observation |
| **Time** | How fast do they want it? | Client priority |
| **Time** | Cost of waiting | Revenue lost per week of delay |

### ROI Formula

```
Current State Cost (Annual)
= (Labor hours × Hourly rate) + Waste + Lost Revenue + Overhead

Target State Cost (Annual)
= Reduced labor + Reduced waste + Captured revenue + Solution cost

Annual Savings = Current State - Target State

ROI % = (Annual Savings - Investment) ÷ Investment × 100

Payback Period = Investment ÷ Monthly Savings
```

### Example Output

| Metric | Current | After Automation | Savings |
|--------|---------|------------------|---------|
| Admin hours/week | 20 hrs | 5 hrs | 15 hrs ($750/week) |
| Status calls/week | 50 | 10 | 40 calls (10 hrs saved) |
| Lost revenue/month | $5,000 | $1,000 | $4,000/month |
| **Annual Savings** | - | - | **$88,400** |
| **Investment** | - | - | **$15,000** |
| **ROI** | - | - | **489%** |
| **Payback** | - | - | **2 months** |

## Integration with Audit Process

### Phase 2 (Intake & Context)
- [ ] Ask the qualification question: "Do you know your daily operating cost?"
- [ ] Route to appropriate discovery depth
- [ ] Set expectations based on their data maturity

### Phase 4 (Opportunity Discovery)
- [ ] Collect baseline metrics (from stakeholder interviews)
- [ ] Populate ROI calculator inputs
- [ ] Identify highest-impact opportunities

### Phase 7 (Investment & ROI)
- [ ] Present ROI calculator with THEIR numbers
- [ ] Show multiple scenarios (conservative, moderate, aggressive)
- [ ] Let the numbers make the case

---

## Why This Works

1. **Removes Guesswork:** We're not making up ROI numbers - we're using theirs
2. **Builds Trust:** We're helping them understand their business first
3. **Aligns Incentives:** We only recommend what the numbers support
4. **Shortens Close Cycle:** The ROI becomes undeniable
5. **Protects Margin:** We can justify premium pricing with clear value

---

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

- **Don't guess baseline metrics** - Always get real numbers or mark as unknown
- **Don't promise ROI without data** - "We need to see your numbers first"
- **Don't skip the qualification question** - It sets the whole discovery path
- **Don't build before baselining** - Without metrics, how do we measure success?

---

## Client Transparency Model

The ROI calculator is shared with the client, not hidden:

1. **Give them the spreadsheet** - They fill in their own numbers
2. **Let them adjust** - If they think a number is off, they change it
3. **Watch the ROI update** - They see the impact of each factor
4. **They own the accuracy** - We're not guessing, they're telling us

**Why this works:**
- Removes "where are you getting your numbers from?" objection
- They manipulate the inputs, we provide the framework
- As they refine numbers, accuracy goes from 60% → 90% → 100%
- They justify the investment to themselves

**Chris's insight:** "We're transparent. We're not guessing here. If we go off, we want to know."

## Sales Script Integration

### The Qualifying Question

Early in discovery call:
> "Quick question - do you know what your daily operating cost is?"

**If YES:**
> "That's rare - you actually know your numbers. Great, that means we can move faster. What is it roughly?"

**If NO:**
> "That's totally normal - most businesses don't track this. Part of what we do is help you understand these numbers first. It's actually one of the most valuable parts of our process."

This question:
- Qualifies the client's data maturity
- Sets the discovery path (Path A vs Path B)
- Positions our discovery as valuable (not just overhead)
- Differentiates us from competitors who skip this

---

## Next Steps

1. Create Google Sheet template for ROI calculator
2. Document standard baseline metrics needed per industry
3. Build qualification question into discovery call script
4. Train team on Path A vs Path B conversations
5. Share draft spreadsheet with Nikki & Alyssa for Plotter Mechanix
6. Collect baseline metrics in stakeholder interviews this week
