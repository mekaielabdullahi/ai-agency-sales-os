## How This Works

You're walking into an industry you've never touched. That's fine. These 10 questions are designed to make the prospect **teach you their world** while simultaneously exposing their pain, inefficiencies, and buying triggers — before you ever ask the 5 Questions.

**The psychology:** People trust advisors who ask smart questions more than advisors who claim to already know the answers. Curiosity is disarming. When a prospect explains their business to you, they re-experience every frustration in real time. By question 10, they've already sold themselves on needing help.

**Rules:**
- Listen 80%, talk 20%
- Write down their exact words — you'll mirror them back later
- Never pretend you know their industry. Say "I'm not an expert in [industry] — that's why I want to understand how YOUR business actually runs"
- Every question has a **persuasion intent** listed — that's for your eyes only

---

## Phase 1: Industry & Operations Deep-Dive (Questions 1-10)

These questions assume zero industry knowledge. They get the prospect talking, teaching, and — without realizing it — cataloging their own problems.

---

### Q1: "Walk me through what your company actually does — like you're explaining it to someone completely outside your industry."

**Persuasion intent:** Forces them to simplify. Simple explanations expose what they think matters most. You'll hear where they light up (passion) and where they gloss over (pain they've normalized).

**Listen for:**
- What they lead with (their identity)
- What they skip over (often where the mess is)
- Who they mention (key roles and dependencies)

**Follow-up if needed:** "Who's the typical customer for that, and what are they coming to you for?"

---

### Q2: "What does a typical day look like for you personally — from when you start to when you stop?"

**Persuasion intent:** Gets them to narrate their workload out loud. Most business owners haven't done this in years. Hearing themselves describe 12-hour days full of firefighting creates an emotional reaction you don't have to manufacture.

**Listen for:**
- Tasks that are clearly below their pay grade
- Repeated phrases like "then I have to..." or "I end up..."
- Where energy drops in their voice (resentment = pain)

**Follow-up:** "Is that how you want to be spending your time, or did it just end up that way?"

---

### Q3: "How does money come in the door — what's the journey from someone not knowing you exist to paying you?"

**Persuasion intent:** Maps their revenue engine without using jargon like "sales funnel." You'll hear every leak, bottleneck, and manual handoff in their acquisition process. Most prospects have never articulated this end-to-end.

**Listen for:**
- Manual steps between stages (lead → quote → close → deliver)
- Where deals stall or fall off
- How many touches/people are involved
- Whether they even track this

**Follow-up:** "Where in that process do you lose the most people or deals?"

---

### Q4: "If I followed one of your team members around for a day, what would surprise me about how things actually get done?"

**Persuasion intent:** This is a permission slip to be honest. "What would surprise me" bypasses defensiveness — they're not admitting failure, they're just being real about reality. This is where you hear about the spreadsheets, the workarounds, the "we know it's bad but..."

**Listen for:**
- Workarounds and duct-tape solutions
- Tribal knowledge ("only Sarah knows how to...")
- Manual processes everyone hates but no one's fixed
- "We've been meaning to fix that"

**Follow-up:** "How long has it been that way?"

---

### Q5: "What's the most important number you track in your business — and how do you actually track it?"

**Persuasion intent:** Reveals their operational maturity instantly. If they rattle off a KPI with a dashboard, they're data-mature. If they hesitate or say "gut feel" — there's a massive visibility gap. Either way, you learn what they value most.

**Listen for:**
- Whether they have a clear answer (maturity signal)
- How they track it (spreadsheet? CRM? gut feel? nothing?)
- Gap between what they WANT to track and what they CAN track
- Whether anyone else sees the same number

**Follow-up:** "Do you trust that number? When's the last time it surprised you?"

---

### Q6: "What's the one thing in your business that, if it broke tomorrow, everything else would stop?"

**Persuasion intent:** Identifies their single point of failure. This is a risk question disguised as a hypothetical. It surfaces key-person dependencies, fragile systems, and infrastructure debt. The answer often scares them — which is the point.

**Listen for:**
- A person's name (key-person risk)
- A specific system or tool (infrastructure risk)
- A process ("if we couldn't do X...") — fragility risk
- Hesitation or nervous laughter (they already know this is a problem)

**Follow-up:** "What's your backup plan if that actually happens?"

---

### Q7: "When you've hired or invested in tools to fix things before, what worked and what didn't — and why?"

**Persuasion intent:** Surfaces failed solutions, wasted budgets, and trust wounds. This is critical intel: you learn what NOT to propose, what they're skeptical about, and what prerequisites were missing. It also positions you differently from everyone who burned them before.

**Listen for:**
- How much they've already spent (budget precedent)
- Why previous solutions failed (missing prerequisites = your opportunity)
- Emotional language ("waste of money", "never used it", "too complicated")
- Whether they blame the tool, the vendor, or themselves

**Follow-up:** "What would have needed to be true for that to actually work?"

---

### Q8: "If you could clone yourself or one of your team members, who would it be and what would the clone do?"

**Persuasion intent:** This question makes them laugh — then think hard. The answer reveals their most constrained resource and the work that's bottlenecked on a single human. This directly maps to automation and AI opportunities without ever saying "AI" or "automation."

**Listen for:**
- Which role they pick (that's the bottleneck)
- What the clone would do (that's the automatable work)
- How they describe the workload ("she's drowning", "he can't keep up")
- Whether the problem is volume, complexity, or both

**Follow-up:** "What would happen to the business if that person could focus on just the highest-value work?"

---

### Q9: "What does your industry look like in 3 years — and are you set up for that, or are you going to have to scramble?"

**Persuasion intent:** Forces future-state thinking. Most operators are heads-down in daily firefighting and haven't looked up. This question creates a gap between where they ARE and where they NEED TO BE — and that gap is your engagement.

**Listen for:**
- Whether they have a clear vision (strategic maturity)
- Competitive threats they're worried about
- "We need to..." statements (unstarted initiatives = opportunity)
- Industry trends they mention (context for your proposal)

**Follow-up:** "What's the biggest thing standing between you and being ready for that?"

---

### Q10: "What made you take this call today — what's different now versus six months ago?"

**Persuasion intent:** This is the buying trigger question. Something changed. Something got worse. A competitor pulled ahead, a key person quit, revenue dipped, or they finally hit a wall. This answer tells you their urgency level and what emotional state they're buying from.

**Listen for:**
- The specific trigger event (what broke or changed)
- Urgency language ("we can't keep...", "I'm tired of...", "we need to...")
- Whether this is exploratory or desperate (calibrates your approach)
- Timeline pressure ("before Q3", "this year", "yesterday")

**Follow-up:** "So if we could solve that, what does winning look like for you in the next 6 months?"

## Transition to the 5 Questions Framework

By now, you know their industry, their operations, their revenue model, their failures, and their trigger. You've spent 15-20 minutes and they've done 80% of the talking.

**Transition line:**

> "I appreciate you walking me through all of that — I've got a really clear picture of your world now. I want to go deeper on a few things. I'm going to ask you 5 specific questions that will help me figure out whether we can actually help you. Sound good?"

---

## Phase 2: The 5 Questions Framework (Questions 11-15)

> Full script and drill-downs: `5-questions-discovery-call-script.md`

---

### Q11 (Framework Q1): "Based on everything you just told me — what's the single biggest problem that's costing you the most right now?"

**Persuasion intent:** They've already described 5-10 problems in Phase 1. Now you're asking them to RANK. Ranking forces commitment. The one they pick is the one they'll pay to fix.

**Key difference from asking cold:** Because of Phase 1, they've already warmed up every pain point. This isn't "tell me your problems" — it's "which of the problems you just described is the worst?" Much easier to answer, much more specific.

**If they give multiple:** "All of those are real. But if you had to pick the one that, if fixed, would have the biggest impact — which is it?"

---

### Q12 (Framework Q2): "You mentioned [restate their problem in their exact words]. What does that actually cost you every month — in dollars, hours, or lost deals?"

**Persuasion intent:** Converts pain into a number. A number becomes a budget. Use their own words from Phase 1 to frame the question — this shows you were listening and makes the question feel like a natural continuation, not an interrogation.

**If they can't quantify, help them:**
- "How many people work on this? How many hours per week? What do you pay them roughly?"
- "How many deals or customers do you lose because of this?"
- "What's each one worth?"

**Write down the number. This is your pricing anchor.**

---

### Q13 (Framework Q3): "How long has this been going on?"

**Persuasion intent:** Duration multiplied by monthly cost equals accumulated damage. If they've been bleeding $15K/month for 18 months, that's $270K gone. You don't even have to say the math — they'll do it in their head. Duration also reveals urgency: long-duration pain with a recent trigger means they're finally ready to act.

**Follow-up based on their answer:**
- Under 3 months: "What changed recently?"
- 6-12 months: "What have you already tried?"
- Over a year: "What's kept this from getting solved until now?"

**The key question:** "What made you decide to finally look at this NOW?"

---

### Q14 (Framework Q4): "If you don't fix this — if we don't talk again and nothing changes — what does the next 6 to 12 months look like?"

**Persuasion intent:** This is the most powerful question in the framework. You're asking them to describe their own future pain. They'll talk about lost revenue, burned-out staff, missed opportunities, and falling behind. They're not hearing it from you — they're saying it to themselves. That's 10x more persuasive than any pitch.

**Let the silence work.** Don't rush to fill it. If they give a short answer, prompt:
- "What happens to your team?"
- "What does that mean for revenue?"
- "What opportunities do you miss?"

**After they answer, summarize:** "So doing nothing costs you [total], plus [consequence], plus [growth impact]. That's the cost of waiting."

---

### Q15 (Framework Q5): "Last question. If I could wave a magic wand and build the perfect solution for this — no constraints — what would it look like?"

**Persuasion intent:** After 14 questions of reality and pain, this is a release valve. They get to dream. Their answer tells you what they actually want to buy, how they define success, and where their expectations may be unrealistic (which gives you the CPO positioning to prescribe what they actually need).

**Let them finish completely, then:**

> "I love that vision. Here's what I'm seeing — based on everything you've told me, there are a couple of foundational things we'd need to get right first so this actually works and doesn't end up like [their failed past attempt from Q7]. Phase one would be [prerequisites]. Phase two is when you get [their vision]. That's how we make sure this sticks."

**This is the CPO pivot** — you're not an order-taker building their wish list. You're a strategic partner who heard their full story and is prescribing the right path.

## Why This Sequence Works

1. **Q1-Q4** make them your teacher. People who teach you trust you.
2. **Q5-Q6** surface risks and blind spots they've been ignoring.
3. **Q7** reveals failed solutions — you now know what NOT to repeat.
4. **Q8** maps their bottleneck to your solution without saying "AI."
5. **Q9-Q10** create urgency through future-gap and buying triggers.
6. **Q11-Q15** take everything they just said and turn it into a diagnosed problem with a quantified cost, proven urgency, and a clear vision — all in their own words.

By the end, you haven't pitched anything. They've diagnosed themselves. Your job is just to say: "Here's how we fix that."
