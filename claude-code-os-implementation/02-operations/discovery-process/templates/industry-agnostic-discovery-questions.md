## How This Works

You're walking into an industry you've never touched. That's fine. These 15 questions are **persuasion-engineered** — each one uses specific psychological techniques to make the prospect open up, get specific, and keep saying "yes" to answering.

**The psychology:** People trust advisors who ask smart questions more than advisors who claim to already know the answers. Curiosity is disarming. When a prospect explains their business to you, they re-experience every frustration in real time. By question 10, they've already sold themselves on needing help. By question 15, they've diagnosed themselves.

**The persuasion layer:** Every question uses at least one technique from the cheat sheet below. You're not just gathering information — you're engineering compliance. The prospect should feel like every question is easy, safe, and even enjoyable to answer. That's how you get honest, specific, actionable answers instead of vague corporate deflection.

**Rules:**
- Listen 80%, talk 20%
- Write down their exact words — you'll mirror them back later
- Never pretend you know their industry. Say "I'm not an expert in [industry] — that's why I want to understand how YOUR business actually runs"
- Every question has a **persuasion technique** label and a **"Why they'll answer"** note — those are for your eyes only

## Persuasion Technique Cheat Sheet

Memorize these. You'll use them in every call.

| Technique | What It Does | Quick Example |
|-----------|-------------|---------------|
| **Presupposition** | Embeds the answer as assumed fact — skips "do you have a problem?" | "When you think about what's slowing you down most..." |
| **Social Proof** | Normalizes answering by referencing what others do | "Most owners I talk to say..." |
| **Permission-Based** | Asks micro-permission first; once they say yes, they commit to answer | "Would you be open to walking me through..." |
| **Ego Appeal** | Flatters their expertise so they want to demonstrate knowledge | "You clearly know this space better than anyone..." |
| **Takeaway / Negative Frame** | "This might not apply to you..." triggers them to prove it does | "I don't know if this is relevant, but..." |
| **Contrast / Binary Choice** | Gives two options — both lead to an answer, neither is "nothing" | "Is it more the people side or the process side?" |
| **Embedded Command** | Subtly directs them to share by burying an instruction in the sentence | "I'd love to hear how you actually..." |
| **Story-Based / Third-Party** | Uses another client's situation to make it safe to relate | "One of our clients was dealing with X..." |
| **Reciprocity** | Give an insight first; they feel compelled to reciprocate with honesty | "I noticed [observation]... how does that play out?" |
| **Specificity Prompt** | Asks for a concrete example, forcing them past vague answers | "Walk me through the last time that happened" |
| **Emotional Labeling** | Names the emotion they're likely feeling — makes them feel seen | "That sounds exhausting..." |

## Phase 1: Industry & Operations Deep-Dive (Questions 1-10)

These questions assume zero industry knowledge. They get the prospect talking, teaching, and — without realizing it — cataloging their own problems. Each question is engineered so the prospect feels safe, respected, and compelled to give you the real answer.

---

### Q1: "I want to make sure I really understand your world before I ask anything else. You know this business better than anyone — walk me through what [Company] actually does, like I'm brand new to your industry."

**Persuasion techniques:** Permission-Based + Ego Appeal + Embedded Command

**Why they'll answer:** You asked permission ("I want to make sure"), complimented their expertise ("you know this better than anyone"), and admitted ignorance — triple disarm. Nobody refuses to explain something when you've told them they're the expert.

**Alternate phrasings:**
- *Ego-forward:* "I've done some homework, but honestly — nobody can explain this like the person who built it. Tell me what [Company] actually does and who you do it for."
- *Permission-forward:* "Before I ask you anything else, would you be open to walking me through your business like I'm completely new to your space? I want to hear it in your words, not from your website."
- *Reciprocity-forward:* "I looked at your site and I can see the surface — but I want to understand how it really works under the hood. Help me see what a stranger wouldn't see."

**Listen for:**
- What they lead with (their identity)
- What they skip over (often where the mess is)
- Who they mention (key roles and dependencies)

**Follow-up if needed:** "Who's the typical customer for that, and what are they coming to you for?"

---

### Q2: "Most business owners I talk to tell me their day looks nothing like what they planned when they started the company. I'd love to hear what a real day looks like for you — from when you open your laptop to when you finally shut it down."

**Persuasion techniques:** Social Proof + Embedded Command + Presupposition

**Why they'll answer:** Social proof ("most owners I talk to") normalizes the answer before they give it. "I'd love to hear" is an embedded command. "Finally shut it down" presupposes overwork — they'll identify with it and start talking.

**Alternate phrasings:**
- *Emotional label:* "I can already tell you're carrying a lot. Walk me through a typical day — I want to see where your time actually goes versus where you wish it went."
- *Story-based:* "One founder I worked with told me he spent 60% of his day on stuff he'd never put in a job description. I'd love to hear what your version of that looks like."
- *Contrast:* "When you started this company, you probably imagined spending your days on [high-value activity]. What does the reality actually look like now?"

**Listen for:**
- Tasks that are clearly below their pay grade
- Repeated phrases like "then I have to..." or "I end up..."
- Where energy drops in their voice (resentment = pain)

**Follow-up:** "Is that how you want to be spending your time, or did it just end up that way?"

---

### Q3: "You've clearly built something that works — people are paying you. Help me understand that journey: from someone who's never heard of you, all the way through to them handing you money. What does that path actually look like, step by step?"

**Persuasion techniques:** Ego Appeal + Embedded Command + Specificity Prompt

**Why they'll answer:** "You've clearly built something that works" strokes ego — they want to show you HOW it works. "Step by step" forces specificity over vague answers. "Help me understand" is a soft embedded command that positions them as the teacher.

**Alternate phrasings:**
- *Presupposition:* "Every business has leaks in how they get customers — places where people fall off or deals stall out. Walk me through your version: how does someone go from stranger to paying customer?"
- *Contrast:* "Some businesses get customers through one main channel, others are piecing it together from five different places. Which is closer to your reality, and what does that journey look like?"
- *Permission-based:* "Would you mind mapping out for me how revenue actually happens? Not the theory — I mean the real, messy version of how a deal goes from first touch to closed."

**Listen for:**
- Manual steps between stages (lead → quote → close → deliver)
- Where deals stall or fall off
- How many touches/people are involved
- Whether they even track this

**Follow-up:** "Where in that process do you lose the most people or deals?"

---

### Q4: "Every company I've ever worked with has at least one thing happening behind the scenes that they'd never put on their website. The workarounds, the duct tape, the 'we know it's bad but...' stuff. I'm not here to judge — what's yours?"

**Persuasion techniques:** Social Proof + Normalization + Takeaway (removes judgment)

**Why they'll answer:** Normalizing the mess ("every company") removes shame. "I'm not here to judge" explicitly removes the threat. Framing it as something they'd "never put on their website" makes it feel like a fun inside confession, not a failure admission. They'll almost enjoy telling you.

**Alternate phrasings:**
- *Story-based:* "One of my clients had their entire billing process running through a single Google Sheet that only one person understood. We all laughed about it — but it was keeping them up at night. What's your version of that?"
- *Permission-based:* "This is the question where I need you to be brutally honest — and I promise, I've heard worse. If I followed one of your team members around for a day, what would make me go 'wait, seriously?'"
- *Ego appeal + takeaway:* "You've clearly built a solid operation. But every business has at least one thing held together with duct tape. Would you be open to telling me what that is? It's usually the most important thing I learn."

**Listen for:**
- Workarounds and duct-tape solutions
- Tribal knowledge ("only Sarah knows how to...")
- Manual processes everyone hates but no one's fixed
- "We've been meaning to fix that"

**Follow-up:** "How long has it been that way?"

---

### Q5: "When you wake up in the morning and check on the business — is there one number you look at first, or are you more flying by gut feel right now? Either way is totally fine, I just want to understand how you keep your finger on the pulse."

**Persuasion techniques:** Contrast / Binary Choice + Presupposition + Normalization

**Why they'll answer:** The binary choice ("one number vs. gut feel") removes the pressure of a "right" answer — both options are presented as valid. "Either way is totally fine" makes both safe. They HAVE to pick one, and either answer gives you exactly what you need about their operational maturity.

**Alternate phrasings:**
- *Social proof:* "Some of the most successful operators I know track one number obsessively. Others are running on instinct and doing just fine. Where do you fall — and what does that look like?"
- *Presupposition:* "There's always that one metric that tells you whether the business is healthy or not — even if it's just a feeling in your gut. What's yours?"
- *Ego appeal:* "You've kept this business alive and growing, so you're clearly reading something right. What's the signal you trust most to tell you how things are going?"

**Listen for:**
- Whether they have a clear answer (maturity signal)
- How they track it (spreadsheet? CRM? gut feel? nothing?)
- Gap between what they WANT to track and what they CAN track
- Whether anyone else sees the same number

**Follow-up:** "Do you trust that number? When's the last time it surprised you?"

---

### Q6: "I had a client last year who told me, 'If our ops manager gets hit by a bus, we're done.' Scared the hell out of them when they said it out loud. What's that thing for you — the one thing that, if it disappeared tomorrow, would bring everything to a halt?"

**Persuasion techniques:** Story-Based / Third-Party + Emotional Labeling + Specificity Prompt

**Why they'll answer:** The third-party story makes it safe to relate — someone else already admitted this fear, so it's okay for them to. "Scared the hell out of them" gives emotional permission to feel scared too. The specificity of the story ("ops manager", "hit by a bus") makes it feel real and forces them to think about THEIR version.

**Alternate phrasings:**
- *Presupposition + takeaway:* "Every business has a single point of failure — that one thing that would bring everything crashing down if it disappeared. Most people know what theirs is, they just don't like saying it out loud. What's yours?"
- *Binary choice:* "When you think about what could take your business down — is it a person, a system, or a process? And what happens if that disappears?"
- *Permission-based:* "This one's a little uncomfortable, but it's the most important thing I can understand about your business. Would you be open to telling me: what's the one thing that, if it broke tomorrow, stops everything?"

**Listen for:**
- A person's name (key-person risk)
- A specific system or tool (infrastructure risk)
- A process ("if we couldn't do X...") — fragility risk
- Hesitation or nervous laughter (they already know this is a problem)

**Follow-up:** "What's your backup plan if that actually happens?"

---

### Q7: "Before we go any further, I want to understand something — because I don't want to repeat anyone else's mistakes. Most companies your size have invested in tools or people to fix problems like this before, and at least one of those didn't work out. Would you be open to telling me what you've tried and what happened?"

**Persuasion techniques:** Reciprocity + Permission-Based + Social Proof

**Why they'll answer:** You gave a clear reason for asking (reciprocity — "I don't want to repeat mistakes"), which makes the question feel like it's in THEIR interest. Social proof normalizes failure ("most companies, at least one didn't work"). Asking permission ("would you be open to...") is a micro-commitment — once they say yes, they're locked into answering fully.

**Alternate phrasings:**
- *Takeaway:* "I'm not going to pretend I'm the first person who's ever tried to help you fix this. You've probably been burned before. I'd rather hear about that now than find out later — what's been tried, and why didn't it stick?"
- *Story-based:* "A lot of the clients I work with come in with scars from vendors or tools that promised the world and didn't deliver. I need to know what I'm walking into. What's been your experience?"
- *Ego appeal:* "You're clearly smart about how you invest in your business. So when something didn't work, there's a reason. Help me understand what you've tried before and what went wrong — I want to make sure I don't propose something you've already burned money on."

**Listen for:**
- How much they've already spent (budget precedent)
- Why previous solutions failed (missing prerequisites = your opportunity)
- Emotional language ("waste of money", "never used it", "too complicated")
- Whether they blame the tool, the vendor, or themselves

**Follow-up:** "What would have needed to be true for that to actually work?"

---

### Q8: "This might sound like a weird question, but it's honestly the one that tells me the most. If you could snap your fingers and clone one person on your team — or yourself — who would it be, and what would you have the clone do all day?"

**Persuasion techniques:** Takeaway / Pattern Interrupt + Embedded Command + Presupposition

**Why they'll answer:** "Might sound weird" pre-frames it as fun and different — they lean in instead of bracing. "Tells me the most" signals this question matters, so they take it seriously. The hypothetical is playful enough that defenses drop completely, but specific enough ("what would the clone DO all day") that you get actionable intel.

**Alternate phrasings:**
- *Social proof:* "I ask this to every business owner I work with, and the answer always surprises me. If you could clone one person in your company, who would it be — and what would the clone spend their time on?"
- *Ego appeal:* "You've clearly got a team that's stretched. If you could magically double one person's capacity — yourself included — who would it be and what would change?"
- *Contrast:* "Is the bottleneck in your business more about not having enough people, or about the wrong people doing the wrong tasks? If you could clone someone to fix it, who and why?"

**Listen for:**
- Which role they pick (that's the bottleneck)
- What the clone would do (that's the automatable work)
- How they describe the workload ("she's drowning", "he can't keep up")
- Whether the problem is volume, complexity, or both

**Follow-up:** "What would happen to the business if that person could focus on just the highest-value work?"

---

### Q9: "You've been in this industry long enough to see where it's heading. In 3 years, some companies in your space are going to be in great shape and some are going to be scrambling to survive. Where do you honestly think you sit right now — closer to ready, or closer to scrambling?"

**Persuasion techniques:** Ego Appeal + Contrast / Binary Choice + Presupposition

**Why they'll answer:** "You've been in this long enough" validates their experience — they want to prove they have the vision. The binary choice ("ready vs. scrambling") forces an honest self-assessment — there's no hiding behind "we're fine." Saying "honestly" signals you want the real answer, not the pitch deck version. Most will admit they're closer to scrambling, which creates the future-gap urgency you need.

**Alternate phrasings:**
- *Social proof + presupposition:* "Every industry is shifting right now. The operators I talk to either have a plan for the next 3 years or they're hoping it'll work itself out. Which camp are you in — and what does your version of 'ready' look like?"
- *Story-based:* "I worked with a company last year that told me they had 18 months before their competitors made them irrelevant. They weren't being dramatic — they were right. When you look at your industry 3 years out, what's the honest picture?"
- *Takeaway:* "This might not keep you up at night, but I have to ask — when you think about where your industry is heading in the next few years, do you feel ahead of the curve or behind it?"

**Listen for:**
- Whether they have a clear vision (strategic maturity)
- Competitive threats they're worried about
- "We need to..." statements (unstarted initiatives = opportunity)
- Industry trends they mention (context for your proposal)

**Follow-up:** "What's the biggest thing standing between you and being ready for that?"

---

### Q10: "People don't take calls like this unless something changed. Something got worse, something broke, or someone finally got fed up. I respect your time too much to dance around it — what was the moment that made you say 'okay, I need to talk to someone about this'?"

**Persuasion techniques:** Presupposition + Emotional Labeling + Specificity Prompt + Reciprocity

**Why they'll answer:** The presupposition ("something changed") validates their decision to take the call — it assumes they're here for a real reason, not just browsing. "I respect your time" is reciprocity — you gave respect, they'll give honesty. Asking for "the moment" forces a specific answer instead of a vague "we've been thinking about it."

**Alternate phrasings:**
- *Social proof:* "In my experience, there's always a trigger — a bad quarter, a key person leaving, a competitor doing something that scared you. What was yours?"
- *Permission-based:* "Can I ask you something direct? What actually happened — recently — that made this a priority? Because six months ago, you weren't on this call."
- *Contrast:* "Six months ago, this wasn't urgent enough to take a call about. Something shifted. Was it a specific event, or just a slow build that finally hit a breaking point?"

**Listen for:**
- The specific trigger event (what broke or changed)
- Urgency language ("we can't keep...", "I'm tired of...", "we need to...")
- Whether this is exploratory or desperate (calibrates your approach)
- Timeline pressure ("before Q3", "this year", "yesterday")

**Follow-up:** "So if we could solve that, what does winning look like for you in the next 6 months?"

## Transition to the 5 Questions Framework

By now, you know their industry, their operations, their revenue model, their failures, and their trigger. You've spent 15-20 minutes and they've done 80% of the talking. They've said "yes" to answering every question so far. That momentum carries into Phase 2.

**Transition line:**

> "I appreciate you being so open with me — I've got a really clear picture of your world now, and honestly, I can already see a few things. I want to go deeper on the specifics. I'm going to ask you 5 more questions — these are the ones that'll help me figure out exactly whether and how we can help you. Sound good?"

*Note: "Sound good?" is a micro-commitment. They'll say yes. That's another "yes" in the chain before you ask them to commit to next steps.*

---

## Phase 2: The 5 Questions Framework (Questions 11-15)

> Full script and drill-downs: `5-questions-discovery-call-script.md`

These are the close-the-diagnostic questions. By this point, the prospect has been teaching you for 20 minutes, they trust you, and they've surfaced their own pain. Now you focus it, quantify it, and make inaction feel more expensive than action.

---

### Q11 (Framework Q1): "You've just walked me through a lot, and I heard several things pulling at you. I want to get really specific now. If you had to point at the ONE thing that's costing you the most — money, time, sanity, whatever the currency is — which one would you point at?"

**Persuasion techniques:** Presupposition + Contrast (multiple categories) + Micro-Commitment

**Why they'll answer:** "You've just walked me through a lot" acknowledges their investment (sunk cost — they've given you 20 minutes, they're not stopping now). Offering multiple categories ("money, time, sanity, whatever") means there's no "I don't know" escape route. They HAVE to pick one. And picking one is a commitment — that's the problem they'll pay to fix.

**Alternate phrasings:**
- *Social proof:* "Most people I ask this to have 3-4 things competing for the top spot. But I need you to pick one — the one that, if you could only fix one thing this quarter, would make the biggest difference. What is it?"
- *Ego appeal:* "You clearly see the full picture of what's going on. But I want your gut — the one problem that, if it vanished tomorrow, would change everything. What is it?"
- *Embedded command:* "I want you to think about everything you just told me and tell me: which one of those problems is the most expensive? Not in theory — in real dollars and real hours."

**Key difference from asking cold:** Because of Phase 1, they've already warmed up every pain point. This isn't "tell me your problems" — it's "which of the problems you just described is the worst?" Much easier to answer, much more specific.

**If they give multiple:** "All of those are real. But if you had to pick the one that, if fixed, would have the biggest impact — which is it?"

---

### Q12 (Framework Q2): "I want to put a real number on this — not to be nosy, but because it helps both of us figure out if solving this is actually worth the investment. When you think about [restate their problem in their exact words] — between the hours burned, the revenue left on the table, and the stuff that just falls through the cracks — what does that add up to per month, roughly?"

**Persuasion techniques:** Reciprocity + Scaffolding + Permission + Presupposition

**Why they'll answer:** You explained WHY you're asking (reciprocity — "helps both of us"), which makes the question feel like it's in their interest, not just yours. Using their own words proves you listened. Giving three categories to add up (scaffolding) makes quantification easy — they're not staring at a blank page, they're filling in blanks. "Roughly" removes the pressure of needing an exact number.

**Alternate phrasings:**
- *Social proof:* "Most people underestimate this number at first. Let's add it up together — how many hours per week does this eat? What does that cost in payroll? What about lost deals or missed revenue?"
- *Story-based:* "One of my clients thought this was costing them maybe $5K a month. When we actually added it up — labor, lost deals, rework — it was closer to $25K. Let's do the same math. What's the real number for you?"
- *Specificity prompt:* "Help me get concrete. How many people touch this problem? How many hours a week? What do you pay them? And how many deals or customers slip through because of it?"

**If they can't quantify, help them:**
- "How many people work on this? How many hours per week? What do you pay them roughly?"
- "How many deals or customers do you lose because of this?"
- "What's each one worth?"

**Write down the number. This is your pricing anchor.**

---

### Q13 (Framework Q3): "Here's the part that usually stings a little. How long have you been living with this? Because if it's been [their monthly cost] per month for even six months, we're already talking about [calculated figure] that's gone and isn't coming back."

**Persuasion techniques:** Emotional Labeling + Presupposition + Accumulated-Cost Framing

**Why they'll answer:** "Usually stings" pre-frames the emotional impact — they brace for it, which actually makes the realization hit harder when they do the math. You're not asking an abstract question about duration — you're connecting duration directly to accumulated damage in real dollars. The money they've already lost becomes visceral. They answer because they NEED to know the real number, even if it hurts.

**Alternate phrasings:**
- *Social proof + presupposition:* "Every client I've worked with wishes they'd had this conversation sooner. How long has this been going on? And when you multiply that by [monthly cost], what's the total damage?"
- *Takeaway:* "I almost don't want to ask this, because the answer is usually painful. How long has this been the situation? Months? Years?"
- *Specificity:* "Take me back to when this started. Was there a specific moment, or did it creep up on you? And how long ago was that?"

**Follow-up based on their answer:**
- Under 3 months: "What changed recently?"
- 6-12 months: "What have you already tried?"
- Over a year: "What's kept this from getting solved until now?"

**The key question:** "What made you decide to finally look at this NOW?"

---

### Q14 (Framework Q4): "Let's say you and I never talk again after this. This call doesn't lead anywhere. You go back to Monday morning and everything stays exactly the same. Walk me through what the next 6 to 12 months looks like."

**Persuasion techniques:** Presupposition + Takeaway + Vivid Future Pacing + Silence

**Why they'll answer:** This is the most powerful question in the framework. "You and I never talk again" is a takeaway — it makes them NOT want that outcome. "Monday morning" makes it vivid and immediate — not abstract, real. Then you go silent. They have to fill the silence with their own future pain. They'll talk about lost revenue, burned-out staff, missed opportunities, and falling behind. They're not hearing it from you — they're saying it to themselves. That's 10x more persuasive than any pitch.

**Alternate phrasings:**
- *Emotional label:* "This is the hard question. If nothing changes — if this conversation is just another conversation that doesn't go anywhere — what does your business look like in 12 months? And how does that feel?"
- *Contrast:* "You've got two paths in front of you. One where this gets solved, and one where it doesn't. Let's talk about the second path for a minute. What happens?"
- *Specificity:* "Be honest with me. If you're sitting here a year from now and nothing's different — what happened to the business? What happened to your team? What opportunities did you miss?"

**Let the silence work.** Don't rush to fill it. If they give a short answer, prompt:
- "What happens to your team?"
- "What does that mean for revenue?"
- "What opportunities do you miss?"

**After they answer, summarize:** "So doing nothing costs you [total], plus [consequence], plus [growth impact]. That's the real cost of waiting."

---

### Q15 (Framework Q5): "Okay, last one — and this is the fun one after all of that. Forget budgets, forget limitations, forget what's 'realistic' for a second. If I could build you the perfect system that makes [their Q11 problem] disappear completely — what does your business look like on the other side? Paint me the picture."

**Persuasion techniques:** Emotional Release + Permission to Dream + Embedded Command + Ego Appeal

**Why they'll answer:** After 14 questions of hard reality and accumulated pain, this is a release valve — and they'll feel it. "The fun one" signals relief. "Forget budgets, limitations, realistic" removes every filter that would make them censor their answer. "Paint me the picture" is an embedded command that invites storytelling, which people naturally enjoy and engage with deeply. They won't just answer — they'll light up.

**Alternate phrasings:**
- *Ego appeal:* "You've obviously thought about what this should look like. If there were no constraints — no budget limits, no tech limitations, no politics — what's the version of your business you'd build? Describe it to me."
- *Social proof:* "This is where my clients always surprise me — because their vision is usually bigger and better than what I would have proposed. So dream big: if I could wave a magic wand, what does the perfect solution look like?"
- *Reciprocity:* "You've given me a really honest picture of where things are. Now give me the other side — the picture of where you WANT things to be. No limits. What does that look like?"

**Let them finish completely, then:**

> "I love that vision. Here's what I'm seeing — based on everything you've told me, there are a couple of foundational things we'd need to get right first so this actually works and doesn't end up like [their failed past attempt from Q7]. Phase one would be [prerequisites]. Phase two is when you get [their vision]. That's how we make sure this sticks."

**This is the CPO pivot** — you're not an order-taker building their wish list. You're a strategic partner who heard their full story and is prescribing the right path.

## The "Yes Chain" — Why This Sequence Works

1. **Q1-Q4** make them your teacher. People who teach you trust you. Every question is permission-based or ego-driven — they WANT to answer.
2. **Q5-Q6** surface risks and blind spots they've been ignoring — using binary choices and stories that make honesty feel safe.
3. **Q7** reveals failed solutions with reciprocity ("I don't want to repeat mistakes") — they tell you what NOT to do, which builds trust that you're different.
4. **Q8** maps their bottleneck to your solution without saying "AI" — using a playful hypothetical that drops all defenses.
5. **Q9-Q10** create urgency through future-gap and buying triggers — with presuppositions that make "nothing's wrong" impossible to say.
6. **Q11-Q15** take everything they just said and turn it into a diagnosed problem with a quantified cost, proven urgency, and a clear vision — all in their own words. By Q15, they've said "yes" to answering 15 straight questions. The next "yes" is saying yes to working with you.

By the end, you haven't pitched anything. They've diagnosed themselves. Your job is just to say: "Here's how we fix that."
