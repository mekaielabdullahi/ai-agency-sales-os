## 🎯 Final Score Calculation

### Formula
```
FINAL SCORE = Task Completion Subtotal (4.0)
            + Strategic Alignment Subtotal (3.0)
            + Time Efficiency Subtotal (2.0)
            + Focus Quality Subtotal (1.0)
            = X/10.0
```

### Example Calculation
```
Task Completion:
- Tier 1: 9/10 × 0.25 = 2.25
- Tier 2: 6/10 × 0.10 = 0.60
- ONE THING: 10/10 × 0.05 = 0.50
Subtotal: 3.35/4.0

Strategic Alignment:
- OBG: 8/10 × 0.20 = 1.60
- Priority: 7/10 × 0.10 = 0.70
Subtotal: 2.30/3.0

Time Efficiency:
- Estimation: 7/10 × 0.10 = 0.70
- Deep Work: 8/10 × 0.10 = 0.80
Subtotal: 1.50/2.0

Focus Quality:
- Distraction: 7/10 × 0.10 = 0.70
Subtotal: 0.70/1.0

FINAL SCORE: 3.35 + 2.30 + 1.50 + 0.70 = 7.85/10
```
