### Work Completed

**Email Sequence Corrections (Cold Email Campaign - Printing Vertical)**

Implemented two critical fixes across all 8 Hormozi-framework email sequences:

**1. Pronoun Corrections (Kelsey = male, he/him/his)**
- Fixed 4 files with incorrect pronouns referencing Kelsey
- `sequence-a-burnout-cycle.md` - Lines 24, 65, 67, 71, 113
- `sequence-b-confusion-hours.md` - Lines 20, 65, 69, 71
- `sequence-g-rate-transformation.md` - Lines 64, 66, 68, 70, 72, 74, 76
- `sequence-h-rma-graveyard.md` - Line 22
- Note: `sequence-c-email-sinkhole.md` correctly refers to Alyssa (female office manager)

**2. Email Cadence Speed-Up (12-day → 7-day sequence)**

| Email | Old Schedule | New Schedule |
|-------|--------------|--------------|
| Email 1 | Day 0, Tuesday | Day 0, Tuesday |
| Email 2 | Day 4, Saturday | Day 2, Thursday |
| Email 3 | Day 8, Wednesday | Day 4, Saturday |
| Email 4 | Day 12, Sunday | Day 7, Tuesday |

**Files Updated (9 total):**
- `sequence-a-burnout-cycle.md`
- `sequence-b-confusion-hours.md`
- `sequence-c-email-sinkhole.md`
- `sequence-d-disappearing-info.md`

- `sequence-f-family-sacrifice.md`
- `sequence-g-rate-transformation.md`
