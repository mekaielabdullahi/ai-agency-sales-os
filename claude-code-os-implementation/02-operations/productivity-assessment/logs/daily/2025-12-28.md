## Productivity Assessment: 2025-12-28

### PRODUCTIVITY SCORE: 8/10

### What You Did Today

**Session 1: 3:30 PM - 5:30 PM (2 hrs) - Plotter Mechanix Tech Setup**
- Downloaded and set up Quo (business phone system with 7-day free trial)
- Downloaded and set up Jobber (field service management)
- Connected Quo and Jobber (required same email on both accounts)
- Set up Sona for call recording and AI transcription
- Tested the integration: Sona records calls, puts transcript into Jobber request notes, and provides summary in Jobber requests
- Got free business phone number through Quo trial

**Session 2: 5:30 PM - 7:45 PM (2.25 hrs) - S&S Wolf Sheds Discovery Part 2**
- Met with team to review Workbook 1 ("Keys to the Castle" ~300 pages)
- Went through S&S Wolf Sheds discovery part 2
- Updated the S&S business process map and opportunity matrix
- Aligned on MVP scope and approach

**Session 3: 6:45 PM onwards - Team Communications**
- Christian from Ant Savvy got back - their meeting in 5 hours (~11:45 AM your time tomorrow)
- Outlined January role separation for the team
- Sent role separation document to team around 7:30 PM for review

### What You Did Well
- **Revenue-generating work:** Both Plotter Mechanix and S&S Wolf Sheds are active client projects
- **Hands-on delivery:** Actually set up and tested the Quo+Jobber+Sona integration
- **Discovery depth:** Thorough Workbook 1 review with team
- **Team alignment:** Proactively addressed January role separation
- **Multiple deals in motion:** S&S ($5K potential this week), Plotter active, Ant Savvy update incoming

### What Held You Back
- Late start (3:30 PM) - lost morning hours
- No Goldfinch hours logged today

### OBG Alignment
- Demo video progress: **No** - No demo videos created
- Pillar focus: **Delivery** - Active client work on two projects
- Revenue impact: **$5K+ potential** - S&S close expected this week

### Key Takeaways

**Plotter Mechanix - Quo/Jobber/Sona Stack:**
- Integration works bare-bones
- 7-day trial to test AI call tagging feature
- Should initiate A2P registration (SMS capability) - no downside, just a waiting game
- Potential to use AI call tagging for deeper analytics

**S&S Wolf Sheds:**
- MVP scope clearer after Workbook 1 review
- $5K agency close expected this week
- Process map and opportunity matrix updated

**Ant Savvy:**
- Christian's meeting in ~5 hours from 6:45 PM = ~11:45 AM Dec 29 your time
- Update expected in morning

**Team Alignment:**
- January role separation outlined and sent to team for review

### Patterns Spotted
- Saturday afternoon/evening session was productive
- Multi-project juggling working well
- Tech setup + discovery in single day = good mix

### Tomorrow's Focus
- THE ONE THING: Hear Ant Savvy meeting outcome and respond appropriately
- Secondary: 6 AM Dec 29 sync for S&S - finalize MVP budget and intake form questions
- Tertiary: Continue Plotter Mechanix testing with Quo/Jobber/Sona

### Brutal Truth
Solid day of real client work after a weak Friday. Late start cost you hours, but the work you did was high-leverage and revenue-aligned.
