## Executive Summary

A high-activity week anchored by two critical Plotter Mechanix interviews (Kelsey ROI validation + Alyssa Part 2 deep-dive) that produced the strongest ROI data yet — $60K+/year in recoverable time waste quantified. Steve Tobey/Hawkwood LLC advanced through discovery with a Feb 11 requirements call. Meanwhile, S&S Wolf Sheds proposal is finalized awaiting client approval (expires Feb 27), and Xigent ($30-40K audit) has gone quiet since mid-January — follow-up needed urgently.

## Project Reports

### Plotter Mechanix (P0)
**Client:** Kelsey (Owner), Chris Andrade (Strategic Partner) | **Status:** Phase 2 Proposal | **Investment:** $5K delivered (Phase 1), $10-14K proposed (Phase 2)

#### Recent Meetings (2)

| Date | Summary |
|------|---------|
| Feb 9 | **Kelsey ROI Interview** — Validated service call metrics: $75/hr rate, 2.5 hrs/day lost to interruptions = $60,450/yr. Joe growing into solo jobs. Mighty Picks LLC generating $2K in 3 weeks (new venture). Kelsey "starting to trust" Phase 1 system. |
| Feb 6 | **Alyssa Part 2 Deep-Dive** — 50% of Alyssa's time (20-25 hrs/week) consumed by email across 10 inboxes. Duplicate client creation in Jobber a top pain point ("We have seven Daves"). Parts ordering 45 min/order. Total recoverable: $67K-$83K/year. |

#### Action Items

**Open:**
- [ ] Fix duplicate client creation in Jobber | Owner: Team | Priority: P0
- [ ] Auto-populate Kelsey's field notes from Quo transcripts | Priority: P1
- [ ] Design email consolidation strategy (10 inboxes to 2) | Priority: P1
- [ ] Present Phase 2 proposal with validated ROI data | Owner: Mekaiel | Priority: P0
- [ ] Get Chris's video content from shop visit | Owner: Chris

**Completed:**

#### Notes
Mighty Picks LLC (Joe's printing venture) emerging as Phase 3 opportunity. Kelsey's deeper "why" is freeing himself for Bread on the Water ministry.

### Remus Development (P0)
**Client:** Michael Kocourek (Owner), David Navarez (VP Ops) | **Status:** Discovery Complete | **Investment:** TBD

- [ ] Schedule proposal review meeting | Owner: Mekaiel | Priority: P1

#### Notes
7+ weeks since discovery call. Michael committed to Outlook Tasks follow-up system but no confirmation of progress. Roles analysis shows Chris should be doing BD (relationship-driven market) while Michael handles internal ops. David needs explicit Loom-style training for any tech adoption.

---

- [ ] Document audit scope, budget, timeline, stakeholders | Priority: P1
- [ ] Schedule follow-up if no client response | Priority: P0

#### Notes
**High-value opportunity going cold.** 4+ weeks since proposal sent with no documented response. Project folder sparse — missing discovery docs, meeting notes, and deliverables. Requires immediate follow-up with Trent to determine status.

---

### AAA DIY Pod (P2)
**Client:** Peer Mastermind Group (12 AAA members) | **Status:** Active | **Investment:** N/A (collaboration)

#### Recent Meetings (0)
No meetings this period. Last documented: January 27 chat summary.

Peer learning network. Recent wins in group: Emma's $19.5K insurance extraction project, Sway's paid AI audit close. Value is deal flow + methodology sharing.

---

**Client:** Internal | **Status:** Ongoing | **Investment:** N/A

#### Recent Meetings (0)
No meetings this period. Education pillar last active Dec 15, 2025.

Active PRDs: Content Opportunity Engine, Enhanced Onboarding System. Education partnership with Katrina stalled since December — follow-up needed.

---

### Maples Apothecary (P3)
**Client:** Toby & Susie | **Status:** Discovery Complete, Ready for Proposal | **Investment:** $1K-$11K (phased)

#### Recent Meetings (0)
No meetings this period.

#### Notes
Strong discovery findings: "Every single day I hear 'I didn't know this building existed.'" Phase 1 quick wins ($1-1.5K): Marketing Playbook, Google Reviews Automation, SOPs. Instagram ads already showing ROI ($250 spend = 400 new followers). Proposal should be next step.

---

### AZ Events Planning (P3)
**Client:** Amy (AZ Inflatable Events) | **Status:** Pre-Discovery | **Investment:** $10K target

#### Recent Meetings (0)
No meetings this period.

#### Notes
~$3M party rental company. Owner Amy in recovery with limited bandwidth. 20+ hours of content already captured. Project stalled at initial contact stage — needs re-engagement for discovery call.

---

## Incubated Lead: Steve Tobey / Hawkwood LLC

**Client:** Steve Tobey (Green Beret, retired) | **Status:** Discovery Part 2 Complete | **Expected Value:** $7-10K initial, $20-45K+ total

#### Recent Activity (2)

| Date | Summary |
|------|---------|
| Feb 11 | **Requirements & Budget Discussion** (Discovery Part 2) — Scoping session for comms infrastructure + marketing acceleration |
| Feb 6 | **Discovery Call** — Core pain: no comms infrastructure (military-to-civilian gap), marketing taking "countless hours" with low ROI. Team of ~10 ex-military operators (ex-MI6, CIA, NSA, FBI). Current mission: rescue 300-600 kidnapped women in Nigeria. |

#### Action Items

**Open:**
- [ ] Synthesize Feb 11 call into requirements doc | Owner: Team | Priority: P0
- [ ] Scope $7-10K initial engagement proposal | Owner: Mekaiel | Priority: P0
- [ ] Document comms platform requirements (security, offline, role-based) | Priority: P1

#### Notes
Strong fit with Mekaiel's defense background. Steve offered Outdoor Channel advertising for Arise. Close probability: 40-50%. No documented blockers.
