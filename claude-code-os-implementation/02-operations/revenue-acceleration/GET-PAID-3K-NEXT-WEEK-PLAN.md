## KEY SUCCESS FACTORS

### 1. Speed & Urgency
- Follow up same day on all leads
- Schedule calls within 24 hours
- Close deals with aggressive upfront asks
- Don't wait for "perfect" - ship and iterate

### 2. Focus on Warm Leads First
- Trevor (existing client, relationship strong)
- Linh (work complete, just need to push)
- Eric (family connection via Mekaiel)
- Community (trust already established)

### 3. Film Demos TODAY
- Eric needs them for sales presentations
- Credibility assets attract "I want this" leads
- Reusable for all platforms (Fiverr, Upwork, LinkedIn)

### 4. Aggressive Upfront Payment Requests
- $1,000 upfront for Phase 3 (Trevor)
- $500-1,500 upfront for Linh completion
- $1,000-2,000 upfront for Upwork/Eric projects
- $200-500 upfront for paid discovery calls

### 5. Community Engagement Reciprocity

- Warm DMs convert faster than cold outreach

### 6. Multi-Channel Promotion
- Share demos on LinkedIn + Community + Portfolio
- Promote Fiverr/Upwork in community (soft sell)
- Cross-promote all platforms

## RISK MITIGATION

### Risk: Trevor not ready for Phase 3
**Mitigation:**
- Follow up Sunday with low-pressure check-in
- Offer smaller Phase 3 ($500 instead of $1,000)
- Defer to January if needed (don't force)

### Risk: Linh contact info lost / relationship cold
**Mitigation:**
- Search email/messages for Linh contact
- Ask Mikael/Linh for intro if needed
- Offer free final testing to re-engage

### Risk: AntSavvy documentation not collected
**Mitigation:**
- Check with Christian ASAP (Sunday)
- Offer to help with documentation collection
- Defer to next week if needed (don't rush bad pitch)

### Risk: Upwork applications ignored (no reputation)
**Mitigation:**
- Apply to 20+ jobs (volume strategy)
- Write highly customized proposals
- Offer paid discovery calls first (lower commitment)

### Risk: Eric clients not ready in 7 days
**Mitigation:**
- Still film demos (long-term asset)
- Use demos for other platforms
- Stay in touch with Eric for January opportunities

### Risk: Burn out from aggressive schedule
**Mitigation:**
- Focus on Tier 1 priorities only if energy low
- Defer Tier 3-4 to next week
- Celebrate small wins daily

---

## DECISION FRAMEWORK

### When to Say YES
- Client wants to pay upfront ($500+)
- Work can be scoped in <2 hours
- Delivery timeline is flexible (7-14 days)
- Relationship is warm (existing or referral)

### When to Say NO
- Client wants full build before payment
- Scope is unclear and requires 4+ hours research
- Delivery timeline is <3 days (too tight)
- Red flags in communication (pushy, unclear, unrealistic)

### When to DEFER
- Opportunity is good but timeline is >7 days
- Client needs to gather information first
- Budget discussion not yet had
- Relationship needs more warming

---

## DAILY CHECK-IN QUESTIONS

**Every evening, ask:**
1. Did I follow up on all warm leads today?
2. Did I schedule any discovery calls?
3. Did I ask for upfront payment on any opportunity?
4. Did I film/share any demos?
5. Did I apply to 5+ Upwork jobs (Mon-Tue)?
6. Did I engage with community/LinkedIn?
7. What's blocking revenue right now?
8. What's the ONE action that could close a deal tomorrow?

---

## COMMITMENT

**Goal:** $3,000 in upfront payments by Dec 13, 2025

**Realistic Target:** $1,500-2,500 (based on conservative/moderate projections)

**Minimum Acceptable:** $1,000 (Trevor Phase 3 + Linh)

**Strategy:** Focus on Tier 1 priorities (Trevor, Linh, Demos) + aggressive Upwork applications + community engagement

**Daily Time Commitment:** 4-8 hours (Dec 7-13)

**Key Insight:** You don't need NEW clients. You need to CLOSE existing warm leads and COMPLETE unfinished work. Trevor, Linh, Eric, and AntSavvy are all partially started. FINISH and COLLECT.
