## Bottleneck Analysis

**Current constraint:** Review/testing/delivery capacity (me)

**Time per project (estimates):**
- Review/test: 2-4 hours
- Gap closure: Variable (depends on gaps)
- Delivery prep: 1-2 hours
- **Total per project:** 4-8 hours average

**Capacity:**
- 2-3 hour daily sessions = 1 project every 2-3 days
- 10-15 hours/week = 2-3 projects per week

**Strategy:**
- Focus on P0 first (revenue critical)
- Batch similar review tasks
- Use AutoClaude to fix gaps where possible
- Ship incrementally (don't wait for perfect)
