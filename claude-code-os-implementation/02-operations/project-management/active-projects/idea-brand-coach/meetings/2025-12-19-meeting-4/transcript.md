0:03 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Okay, so I got it to a place now where it's producing outputs, so you can see brand values, or you can see this one that I made actually, so this brand vision I created with Generate with AI, so to empower individuals and communities to embrace sustainability, fostering a world where conscious choices lead to a healthier planet and more equitable society.
SCREEN SHARING: Matthew started screen sharing - WATCH: https://fathom.video/share/a4ejzh9sTE1r8cCbKHxn8jmST36zvxsy?timestamp=7.50672 Together, we envision a future where innovation and responsibility drive positive change, creating a thriving ecosystem for generations to come. So I want to try that for the brand purpose now. Let's see what it comes up with. Thank

1:03 - Trevor Bradford
So what brand is this format, or is this just a generic statement?

1:08 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
I've just put a little bit about my brand in here, so it doesn't have a whole lot of context. But at least it's producing an output that's the same format. But it doesn't seem to be great yet. I wonder, I'm trying to think how can we get to good outputs most quickly. But I think I just need to push my updates to lovable. Maybe I just do that right now, and then you can test it and see how it goes on yours. Okay. you.

2:11 - Trevor Bradford
So is this Apple's code editor, Matt, this app you're using here?

2:18 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
So this is VS Code. It's Microsoft's code editor, IDE.

2:25 - Trevor Bradford
Okay.

2:26 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
And then this is called Cloud Code.

2:29 - Trevor Bradford
Yeah. I've of Cloud Code.

2:32 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Yeah. Yeah. The one by Anthropic. It's my favorite one. I've tried other ones. But this one, I really like how it'll generate to-dos and then it'll check off the to-dos. And I just, I find that amazing for whatever reason. Wait a minute. that. See

3:06 - Trevor Bradford
So you captured some of Fathom's notes from the previous section, did you, where I was talking about the book? Is that where that came from? In the top right, up here on the top right hand corner? Each section it says, that one there.

3:27 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Oh, this one?

3:28 - Trevor Bradford
Yeah, where did all that come from?

3:30 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
So, yeah, this was me trying to get to the output. So I think the last thing I said was... Wait, let me just scroll up. So this came from, I was prompting, I was working with it while we were chatting. So the last thing I asked it was, I think I just said, this is the current output and I copy and pasted the output with the instructions. And I said, this is not what I want. I want the output to have applied our understanding of the framework to the inputs and conversations. So that was a bit earlier on, and it modified a bunch of the files here. And then it still wasn't quite what we wanted, but it said each one now categorized by type, weaves it into flowing paragraphs, explains what the data means. It's a lot of times it like over promises. It sounds really good, but I have to go in and verify and, you know, make sure that it actually did the thing. Um... Um... So let's see, now, Lovable, I think Lovable should have the updates, but I'm going to check on my end. So it has the updated, actually, yeah, maybe, I think it does now. Let me, actually, let me verify, brand. I've worked with it so much that I'm just like, I want to believe, but it just always seems to, there always seems to be something, so. Okay, well, works on my end. Maybe, do you want to share a screen and test it out on your, on maybe the H4H1?

5:41 - Trevor Bradford
Yep. Oh, it's, where are we? So many windows on that.

5:59 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I always have that.

6:18 - Trevor Bradford
The cop. Finally, there it is. No, that's a... That's a... document. That's a book. We'll close that down. It's always my lovable thing on there. I think I've lost my window. I have to open it up again.

6:53 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Sorry. No worries. best. Since there is a Thank you.

7:41 - Trevor Bradford
I'm not getting anything, Matt, I'm getting a blank screen.

7:47 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
This isn't lovable?

7:48 - Trevor Bradford
Yeah.
SCREEN SHARING: Trevor started screen sharing - WATCH: https://fathom.video/share/a4ejzh9sTE1r8cCbKHxn8jmST36zvxsy?timestamp=488.837973

7:53 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
That's weird. Could you share screen and I can see if I can figure something out. Yeah. Yeah. I wonder if there's anywhere you can make sure you're logged in, or is it just being slow?

8:31 - Trevor Bradford
Try a different link. This is one that should take me to BrandCoach. Yeah. But we're not seeing anything now.

8:43 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Hmm.

8:45 - Trevor Bradford
That's weird, isn't it?

8:47 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Yep.

8:50 - Trevor Bradford
Preview. Offering me a remix, but I don't want to do that, of course.

8:57 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Is there anywhere that's like like- Log in? Maybe it's just blocked because you're not logged in. No, that looks like you're logged in because it knows that.

9:13 - Trevor Bradford
Yeah. We just pushed your file, haven't we?

9:21 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Yeah. But on my end, I can see the preview.

9:32 - Trevor Bradford
Let me see if I can log out in some way. Just close all those windows. Right. So this was that same link on an old tab.

9:45 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
If I refresh it, let's see what happens.

9:50 - Trevor Bradford
Yeah, it disappears, Matt, if I refresh.

9:55 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Yeah. Well, some more. Okay, these are the latest updates that I just pushed on the bottom there. Yeah. I'm really not sure. Let's see, because the preview is already selected, so it should be showing up. What happens if you click the cloud icon right next to the preview? Okay, and then what if you go back to preview now, the world one? Nothing. What if you hit refresh again?

10:58 - Trevor Bradford
Oh. you. It's promising, doesn't it?

11:03 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Yeah, something seems to be coming in. It's been really slow, though.

11:13 - Trevor Bradford
So this is what we had before. So it's retained the chat that I had with it. Yeah. So I did generate with AI.

11:38 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Let's see.

11:42 - Trevor Bradford
Yeah, it's not giving me the accept or implement button.

11:47 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Oh, yeah. I haven't done that yet. But does this purpose look a little better?

11:57 - Trevor Bradford
Yes. He can And Yeah.

12:03 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Okay.

12:05 - Trevor Bradford
But I can't remember whether that is what I put into it from my strategy document that I shared with you, you know, for H4H.

12:16 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Or not.

12:18 - Trevor Bradford
I mean, I just can't remember. So we've got a vision statement here. Let's explore the vision statement. Yeah, so I'm pretty certain I, no, I didn't put that in, think. So where is it pulling from? It's got to be pulling from this stuff that we implemented earlier across the other tools, hasn't it? Yeah. If I do generate with AI, it's the same statement. and

13:03 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
So this is the same one as the brand purpose one?

13:08 - Trevor Bradford
Yeah, so I've just cut that. Let's do generate with AI and see what it gives me. Let's just give me some generic crap.

13:25 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Yeah, it sounds just like the one that it did for me.

13:28 - Trevor Bradford
Yeah. So that's the one that I had before, this one, which is, I believe, the one from my strategy document, which I've given to you. Okay. So if, just so we've got a point of reference, if I take that away and ask it to generate again. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. It just gives me a nonsense statement.

14:02 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
So when you did the purpose one, was this copy and pasted, or was this from what you just did? Did you click the generate with AI button for the purpose?

14:17 - Trevor Bradford
Do you know what I can't remember? And what I'm going to do, I'm going to save both of those as text so we don't lose them.

14:27 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Okay.

14:28 - Trevor Bradford
So we can put them back in a moment. Right. So let's, if we do a brand purpose, we do generate with AI. Yeah, it's just generic BS, isn't it? Okay. So if I put that back, and then... I'd do a generate with AI and see if it changes anything. Made a small change there, didn't it? But it doesn't give us the option to save it or accept it or reject it.
ACTION ITEM: Implement Save/Accept/Reject for AI suggestions; wire KB context to AI; send updated version to Trevor for AM review - WATCH: https://fathom.video/share/a4ejzh9sTE1r8cCbKHxn8jmST36zvxsy?timestamp=916.9999

15:15 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Okay, so I think I get what, like, sort of what we want. I think I do need to go and iterate on it offline. And then you want the ability to save and accept or reject, right?

15:36 - Trevor Bradford
Yeah. And if we reject it and we prompt the AI to help us again, obviously, we'd like it to give us something that's on brand, not some generic piece of fluff.

15:50 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Yeah, for sure. I think it's just a matter of me tracing through what it's doing. listening. And then, you know, figuring out how to connect it to the right context. And I might just try, I also want to try getting your book into the system knowledge base. Potentially, that will be a bit faster if I can just say, hey, you know, reference this book and put together the brand purpose, using the context from this book.

16:35 - Trevor Bradford
I mean, in order for it to put together a brand purpose, a brand vision and mission, it needs information about the brand that it's going to work on, doesn't it? And to get something like this, where it's just this generic stuff, suggests to me that it doesn't have the context to work with. It hasn't got any brand.

17:03 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Yeah, it's not pulling from the right place right now, but the website itself does have the ability to pull from the relevant context. I'm assuming that all the relevant context for the brand is in the knowledge base for that user. So using that as the assumption, then all I need to do is wire up where it actually pulls from that. So that's what I'm planning to do. And if we can get these generate with AI things improved, then that will populate the brand. Okay. Thank Canvas output. That one's just basically copy and pasting from here, so we shouldn't have any additional logic there. Then I think that can, you know, we'll need to probably iterate a bit more on the outputs, but I should be able to send you something like before I go to bed tonight with an improved version here.

18:30 - Trevor Bradford
Okay, that'd be great. Okay, it's coming up for 9.20 here, so I'll probably be off to bed soon, so I'll look at it in the morning and get some thoughts back to you. But I think if we can plug the booking to the app, that will help. And I don't know whether or not you're able to distill anything from the document on Age for Age, and turn it into something that is. I we'll just started. It's not age-for-age specific, but it helps in some kind of way in terms of steps through the process, if that helps. Yeah, so I think that the way... Or actually, if having thought about it, sorry to interrupt, you want me to do something with it, let me know what would be useful to give you back.
ACTION ITEM: Draft SOP for brand strategy doc in ChatGPT; send to Matt; then Matt implement OpenAI prompt - WATCH: https://fathom.video/share/a4ejzh9sTE1r8cCbKHxn8jmST36zvxsy?timestamp=1153.9999

19:24 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Yeah, that's a good point, because, I mean, if you can basically maybe work with ChatGBT and put together like a list of instructions for how to create that document, then that would help a lot. Because all I basically need is the right instructions to feed to this website to produce that output.

19:57 - Trevor Bradford
Okay, I'll... I'll give it all the strategy steps that we see here. No, it's still going to have to pull from somewhere, pull brand knowledge from somewhere, isn't it?

20:13 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Yeah, so let's assume that the brand knowledge is in the conversations that the people have had with the coach and in the inputs in the rest of the app. And then that it can pull from there. What I was going to say is I think we can get to a minimal version by beta, but more involved stuff might take longer. I don't know, but like I think if you can generate an instruction set for like maybe even like an SOP for how you create. can really Yeah. So of gregerman what the I How do you create that document? Because what I'm thinking is AI is good at maybe even, yeah, AI is good at like copying things. So if I have a copy of a good example document, that can also probably help. But the goal is to create, have the website create a document like that, right?

21:24 - Trevor Bradford
Yep. So we need to sort of walk- Yeah, give me a little time to work on that, Matt. I'll explain to ChatGPT that we're working in Lovable. Would that help it? Tell it I want Lovable prompts or do I just want an SOP?

21:43 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Um, I would say something like, like I'm, I'm creating a- A coaching software that will help, well let's see, what are we trying to do? We're trying to create a document with their full brand strategy.

22:17 - Trevor Bradford
That's the idea behind brand canvas, right? Yep.

22:27 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
So I would say something like, even if it's in that thread, at the end of that thread, don't know if you want to, I don't know if you can copy threads. Because if you could copy that H4H thread, then you still have that existing one. And then use the new copy to be like, you know, let's look, let's analyze this conversation. And let's see, can you help me pull out instructions? What for creating this document? Assuming that we have access to a bunch of knowledge about the customer.

23:11 - Trevor Bradford
What I need is the instructions. Right, so if I copy that link that I gave you to thread into here. No, that's not that. Copy. . . . . . .

23:46 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
. You So the link that you gave me, when I click it, it says this is a copy of the conversation.

24:12 - Trevor Bradford
So maybe I could... Let me share this with you.

24:20 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Stop that.
SCREEN SHARING: Trevor started screen sharing - WATCH: https://fathom.video/share/a4ejzh9sTE1r8cCbKHxn8jmST36zvxsy?timestamp=1473.748317

24:28 - Trevor Bradford
Right, okay. This is my chat GPT. I posted the thread sharing. I asked you to read it and confirm that you don't take any action. It says, I can't see what the thread contains. Mm-hmm. Oh, okay. All right. Well... If you... If you... you...

25:00 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Could you mouse over the threads over there on the side? I wonder if there's a way to just copy that thread, the H4H one.

25:10 - Trevor Bradford
Yeah.

25:17 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
If you click the top right, the share button again. Let's see what options there are. Share link to chat. You've already shared a link. If you'd like to include new messages. What happens if you click your link that you sent in the WhatsApp?

25:55 - Trevor Bradford
It opens the shared conversation window, Matt.

25:58 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Let's see Is it something that's, is it a copy of it? I can't, I don't know if I can see that window.

26:15 - Trevor Bradford
Scroll back to the top, I'll be able to confirm. Yes, it is, yeah. And it gives me an option to open it in a browser.

26:31 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Okay, so maybe work off of that one.

26:35 - Trevor Bradford
If I open it in a browser, oh, it's open chat GPT again. Okay. But if I share this browser link with you, that you might be able to open that. Try that. Oh, it's still chat GPT though. It's a web version. I'll just copy. You can paste it. Don't worry. And I'll explore it. I think I know what's needed anyway. We need an SOP to generate this kind of document. I'll give it the context of the app. I'll show it the page and the strategy steps, so it's got a full understanding. And then I'll get something to you shortly. Okay.

27:24 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Yeah. I guess basically what we need is just the process to generate the document. And then I can incorporate it into the, I think I'll, I'll end up making a prompt that follows the process. Um, because what we, what I need to do on the backend is instruct, like send a prompt to open AI. Um, and then that will run through the process and generate the document.

27:58 - Trevor Bradford
Right. Okay. All right, let me explore this and then you can come back and tell me if there's additional stuff that you need. If you give me 10-15 minutes and then I'll get something over to you.

28:12 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Okay, sounds good.

28:15 - Trevor Bradford
All right, I'll stop the share for the moment and we'll stop the meeting here and then I'll send you the document over.

28:29 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Okay, sounds good. And I'll work on that save and reject thing and then also trying to make sure we get the vision and each section of the AI suggestions working.

28:51 - Trevor Bradford
Okay.

28:52 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Okay.

28:53 - Trevor Bradford
All right, thanks Matt. Good long meeting that one. I'll speak to you soon.

28:58 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Thank you.

28:59 - Trevor Bradford
Okay. you in a little bit.

29:00 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Bye. Bye.
