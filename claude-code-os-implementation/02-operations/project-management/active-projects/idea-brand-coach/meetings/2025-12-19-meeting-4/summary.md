Meeting Purpose

Test and debug the "Generate with AI" feature in Lovable.

Key Takeaways

- AI Output Failure: The "Generate with AI" feature produces generic, unusable text because it lacks context from the user's brand knowledge base.
- Critical Missing UI: The feature lacks "Accept" and "Reject" buttons, preventing users from saving or refining AI-generated content.
- Path Forward: Matthew will fix the context issue and add the missing UI. Trevor will create an SOP for generating brand strategy documents to guide the AI's process.

Topics

AI Feature Failure

- Problem: The "Generate with AI" feature generates generic, unusable text (e.g., "generic BS," "nonsense statement").
- Root Cause: The AI lacks access to the user's brand context, which resides in the app's knowledge base (conversations, inputs).
- Impact: The feature is currently non-functional and cannot produce on-brand content.

Missing UI & UX Issues

- Missing UI: The feature lacks "Accept" and "Reject" buttons, preventing users from saving or refining AI-generated content.
- UX Bug: Trevor experienced a blank screen on the Lovable preview, which was resolved by refreshing the page.

Path Forward: Context & Process

- Goal: Enable the AI to generate a complete brand strategy document (Brand Canvas) by providing it with the correct context and a structured process.
- Context Fix: Matthew will connect the AI to the user's knowledge base.
- Process Definition: Trevor will use ChatGPT to create a Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for generating the document.
  - Input for SOP: The "H4H" brand strategy document and its associated ChatGPT conversation thread.
  - Rationale: The SOP will be translated into a backend prompt, giving the AI a step-by-step guide to follow.

Next Steps

- Matthew:
  - Fix the context issue to connect the AI to the user's knowledge base.
  - Add "Accept" and "Reject" buttons to the AI generation UI.
  - Push an updated version to Lovable for testing by Trevor.
- Trevor: - Create an SOP for generating a brand strategy document using the H4H example. - Send the SOP to Matthew to inform the backend prompt engineering.
