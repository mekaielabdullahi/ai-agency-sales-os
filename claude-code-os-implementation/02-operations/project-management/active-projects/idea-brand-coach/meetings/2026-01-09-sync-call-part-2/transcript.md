# Sync Call Part 2 - January 9, 2026

## Transcript

Matthew Kerns
Yeah, I like the Google suite. There's so many free AI tools and things that are coming out now. It's crazy.

But Google has such an edge from all the data they've been collecting. But yeah, I think I want to try and send out a Google Meet link for us to meet using because I just like to not get interrupted and like continue the flow.

So, okay, let me just try and jump right back into where we were.

Trevor Bradford
So what I was about to say was that for each of those modules that don't have a great deal of functionality, I could use them as teaching modules and include video, an avatar video.

That's one option. Okay, so it means that the structure remains the same to the app. We don't have to build in any new.

Thank you. Thank Functionality at this phase for them. And, and, and I just do a lesson on the, you know, short lesson, three, four minutes, maybe a little bit of video of some sort, uh, I like that.

I like that a lot and you know, a couple of screenshots and things like that built into the video.

You know, I, I could do that relatively easily, I think.

Matthew Kerns
Yeah. Cause what I was thinking is like, I don't know. Like there's necessarily benefit to removing these, like there's information in here.

As long as you think this information is, uh, you know, highly valuable and it's not too raw or just like unrefined.

Trevor Bradford
Um, I would, if you look at, if you scroll back up the page there, um, no, sorry, scroll down the page, I beg your pardon to, on that module that we were.

We talk about the pillars and we scroll down a bit further and it gives some action points, doesn't it?

The page that we were on a minute ago. I think that was this one. Yeah, it says action steps.

List three functional differences your brand has. Identify blah blah blah. It's giving you action steps, but it's not giving you any kind of tool or field to do that.

Immediately adjacent to it. So, you know, there's a bit of real world example stuff there that there's a bit of blurb at the top.

And there could be a video of the talking head, but there's no there's no tool to capture the outputs.

Yeah.

Matthew Kerns
What about if you just in the video, you're just like showing someone like, hey, you can just copy and paste this like for now.

Sorry, like this isn't built out yet. But, you know, part of our beta feed. Before we build further and invest development dollars into building out this feature, we want to understand, like, how users actually interact with the website and the app.

And so, like, we've just left some of these where it's you can't directly fill it in and like a form because we're just not entirely sure about the form filling value.

So, like, what you can say in the video is, like, for now, you know, a workaround since the app isn't fully built out, you can just copy and paste this and bring it over to the chat, you know, start a new conversation and just copy and paste and just let's, like, use this brand coach to help kind of work through these things interactively.

So that's one potential workaround. going to We'll We'll And that the value of the guidance is still there, and they can still make progress towards their ultimate brand strategy document and incorporate all the information that you're giving them.

So I don't know if you want to necessarily recommend to them to just copy and paste it, because it might take more thought, but I think it might be a good workflow.

Like, they upload it to here, and then this thing goes and cranks some information, but we want the person to actually figure it out for their brand.

But, like, with all these AI tools and stuff, like, reviewing the AI... Outputs is something that I think is one of the highest leveraged things that we can do because it can go research, it can go make progress, but we need to make sure that it makes sense.

And it's not just slop. Yeah. No, we don't want slop. Yeah.

Trevor Bradford
Yeah, I'm always trying to look for ways to reduce and simplify rather than build out and add on at this point, because first of all, it means less, hopefully less work for both of us.

And also, it's the Occam's razor principle, isn't it, that simplest solution is usually the best one. Yeah.

Matthew Kerns
So, yeah, like, okay, if you think about in the future. So far, software has been, we fill out things in a form, right?

And then it gets stored in a database. In the future, it's like, and right now even, it's like talking with LLMs, and then they handle the storage, and they handle like, even like, if you look at Google GenLabs, there's a new thing called Disco, where they are literally, I think it's GenTabs, actually.

They're dynamically generating UI. So like, literally, any work that we do on UI might just be completely replaced by this new UI generation.

I'm not sure if you've seen this yet. No, I haven't. So let me know if you can hear.

Trevor Bradford
So what's the implication of that for the app, Matt?

Matthew Kerns
So I think it's about to get to it, let's keep watching the video, it's only a minute 40 seconds long and you'll see.

Thank you. you. Thank you. Thank So, like, it's now it's created this interactive thing that's more, like, meant to help them plan out their trip, right?

So they're going on a ski trip. And it's like, well, there's all this information from all these websites. And, you know, there's different locations, different activities, things to do.

So it's just like, oh, let's just put it on a map with a calendar, because you're trying to plan out dates and places.

So it's generated this UI that, like, they can use for their specific use case. Yeah. So... That's basically the point.

The implication for the app is like, we don't want to get too tied to a particular UI because it's like, if we can refine sort of like the user experience and the inputs and the outputs, we might be able to provide this type of experience where they can create their own custom UI.

Interacting with the app. It's a bit, honestly, it's a bit even over my head at the moment, like how this is all going to play out.

But this is something that there, it's like a Google labs thing that you can play around with, like right now, like this came out, this video came out four weeks ago.

And I don't know how far along it is. I think that one's still in beta. But But But But But But But

That's crazy. think, I mean, in the next 30 seconds, they're probably going to show more. I don't know if you want to see more of that or you want to get back to the app.

Trevor Bradford
Well, I'm not sure of the implication for the app. I've only, this is the first time I've seen it.

I don't know what it means to us other than UI is going to evolve dramatically over the next year in all likelihood.

And getting heavily a build ourselves may be not particularly valuable in a short space of time. So, I don't know.

Yeah, it's crazy.

Matthew Kerns
And one thing that me and one of my business partners are excited about is like, there's going to be UI, there's going to be like frameworks where we can

Like provide this experience within a particular use case. So like if they come to your website, they can sort of make a custom experience in the UI.

So like some people learn more from video, some people learn more from visuals, just images, some people learn more from reading.

So they might be able to customize their own experience within your app. So that's one possibility, but I would say take a look at this stuff, like learn for yourself what's going to be going on because it's crazy.

I think we're all trying to wrap our heads around it. But I think one thing that's pretty, seems fairly constant is that we're typing, or we're .

Interacting with the LLM still. So we're prompting, either if it's through voice or through text, right? I think voice is a little faster.

I talk with my tools as much as possible because I can talk faster than I can type. So boiling down the interaction through voice and text with the tool, I think is something we can ground ourselves in with all the changes that are going to be happening this year.

So, like, I do think that a widget right here is something that, and like this chat interface, you know, it's good for now for the beta stage.

about the omega-1 page, But I think we might evolve it. The chat interaction to provide documents and text and just ideas is going to be something that I think will stay.

So, by the way, this is something else that I updated. So there's like you can upload documents and it has this thing right here that shows you your documents that you've uploaded.

And then there's this delete functionality. So I uploaded the one that you gave me as part of the service that I purchased from you.

And so I was using that to test if the canvas output incorporated that stuff.

Trevor Bradford
And did that work OK?

Matthew Kerns
Yeah, I think it worked great. At first it didn't work, but, you know, I got it working. So cool.

Trevor Bradford
So where does the app store that? I know. Does it put it into a folder where it becomes your personal knowledge base within the app?

Or does it just hold it there in the app while it does its thing? And then you have to delete it to put more in there.

So I don't know, I'm thinking of it sort of like a piece of functional memory, like on a computer, where it will hold something.

But you've not stored it to a hard drive. It's just there for use while the process is happening. And then it's gone.

Or is it then saved, alternatively, for the user to refer back to?

Matthew Kerns
Right.

Trevor Bradford
And if that's the case, where is it? Is it on GitHub or Superbase? Or, you know, I don't really understand how the back end of this app is working with all these bits.

Thanks. How does all this fit together behind the scenes? I can't imagine.

Matthew Kerns
So there's three places where it's stored. So it's stored in a local state. So there's some information that's stored in a local browser state.

So like, there's your cookies that you have that keep track of the local browser state, like when you when you type in things here, or when you, I believe also when you upload a document, like this state here, but it's only briefly stored there.

Like, because if you hit refresh, and it was only stored there, it wouldn't, it wouldn't, it wouldn't stay. Actually, sorry, if you refresh, it would still be there.

But if you this video. Bye. Clear your cookies, it wouldn't be there anymore if it was only stored there.

So there's local storage, then there's Supabase data storage, where it's actually backed up for each user in Supabase. This document, we actually store it in a vector store in OpenAI.

So that's where I have it stored right now per user. So it's sectioned off per user. So only my user vector storage has this.

And then there's also a, so actually, do you have any questions about that? What is it just said so far?

Trevor Bradford
One prompt, one question that just prompted for me is that if we're effectively offering storage for documents to users, this document, So put What's you.

There'll be a cost for that, I imagine, and I expect OpenAI would be billing me rather than the customer.

So if customer uploads huge quantities of documents, the storage space will increase and the cost of usage, either for them or for me, will increase.

And how, in practical terms, how does that get paid for? Is it likely to be expensive or is it just minute bits of cost?

Because obviously, on an ongoing basis, if this becomes a commercial proposition, then the costs of running it, I've got no way of calculating what that might be at the moment.

And what I don't want to do is get into a situation where this is a great tool, but people are expecting everything for free at the moment.

And next thing I know, I've got a couple of hundred users and I get a bill at the end of the month from various suppliers of the service that make up the app, like Lovable or OpenAI or Superbase.

And I've got a 20 grand bill that turns up at the end of the month because it's been so successful.

But what we haven't been able to do is get people to cover the cost for it. Have you got any way of even guessing what that might be?

So yeah, we do.

Matthew Kerns
And that's a great prompt. And I think that you can see it the way the other apps handle it with like, they'll charge for credits.

So, um, with, with each prompt that you send. There's a token count associated. So that's like your text that you put in is part of like one of these is like one token.

And this might be another token. And it's like three to five characters generally one token. These LLMs charge like something like eight cents per million tokens or something.

It's like it's sort of abstract. But there is a formula and a calculation that we can do. And then with documents, if the entire document is packed into the context window, and it's a large document, that can get very expensive because it's like, okay, this is a 50-page PDF, right?

And how many tokens are in this PDF? And if that's being run through each prompt, That can get out of hand.

So there's something called retrieval engineering. That's a new thing that's developing. That's like, how can we optimize our token costs?

What are the techniques that we can use to optimize our token costs? And then, so there's a way that we can optimize it where it doesn't blow up and go crazy, which we need to make sure that we do.

Um, then for, for customer facing applications, there's usually like a credit tier. So there's like a free tier and you only get a certain amount of credits.

And basically like you can interact with, you can usually interact with the tool for some period of time before you run out of credits.

And like, once you dig into, okay, now I want to. And then, oh shoot, I'm out of credits, but I really like this app.

It's time to invest in the next tier up, right? It might be 20 bucks a month and you get a certain amount of credits and then you run out of those and then you're like, okay, well, it's worth the investment if I just buy the $50 a month one.

So that's kind of how to offload the costs of the AI credit usage and storage. So I guess that was more talking about the token usage.

So then I'll need to look at the storage aspect as well and make sure that they're both accounted for in that calculation.

ACTION ITEM
Draft cost/scaling plan for AI tokens + storage; review w/ coaches; send to Trevor
But that's the general idea. Um... Here's what I'll do. I'll put together a plan and some documentation around the expected costs and kind of how that scales as people use it.

I think that this is pretty critical for beta testing because, like, we don't want to run up a huge charge in your account for beta users, and we can install barriers if we just know a base level of, like, this is where the costs start getting too much.

So we can cut people off for, you know, we can define a free tier and just cut people off for the beta testing.

And that will, I mean, that will be good for sales as well, but I will also go over this with my...

Some of my coaches, and then I'll get back to you on that. Okay, that's great, Matt.

Trevor Bradford
Thank you. One thing that we had prior on some of the prior iterations of the app was a beta test function, which I think we took off the menu and archived it for the moment.

Regarding the beta test and the feedback, do you think we should reinitiate that so that people have got somewhere to leave their comments and they haven't got to start filling out separate Google Forms or that kind of thing?

Yeah, I think so.

Matthew Kerns
I think probably, yeah, we should make it easy for people to submit their feedback right there in the app.

Yeah. And then if there's We can also tell people, like, if you're comfortable, you know, here's a flow where you can basically record yourself doing it and just call out everything you're thinking.

I think that might be a really good way to capture feedback is just have them do it live so it's not like a separate form and they need to remember stuff.

You know, like if they're comfortable, obviously, because there will be some people who just don't want to be recorded.

Trevor Bradford
But, yeah, a couple of years ago, I was a beta tester on some of the early stages of finance tools.

And it. OK, we weren't anywhere near where we are now in terms of use of A.I. and similar, but there were it was a separate Google sheet where you had to type in your comments.

And it was all all a bit clunky and it got a bit tiresome in the end. even It's Maybe It's But It's

And just like to get your input on what you think is the best way to deal with it. Is it a voice recording that is transcribed or should it just be a little field against each tool that you just type your feedback in?

But there ought to be questions, I guess, well, didn't there, for each tool that prompt a response because otherwise we're relying on people to articulate something that they might not find easy.

Matthew Kerns
Yeah, so I would say we probably won't go the route of having a field next to each feature just because that has a development cost associated.

And testing and validating that the feedback gets uploaded, I just think that there's probably a better approach. bit challenge.

I think it's the big challenge. I like the idea of a natural, just, hey, like right when you start, if you can record yourself, like there's, even if it's just the free version of Loom, right, that we just say, hey, like, can you just record your first five minutes interacting with the app and, you know, let us know how that goes.

You can do multiple, you can do up to 25, five minute videos. So if there's something that they want to record, they don't just have to record the first five minutes, but it'll record their screen and their audio and them on video.

So their, you know, facial, their actual reactions, we can get body language stuff as well. Yeah, I think that would be the ideal.

I think we should also definitely provide a, like alternative. Where, you know, like, here's another workflow where you can pull up your, you can pull up like a Google Doc on the side and just type stuff out or like, you know, we provide a structured questionnaire where it's like, we can do like, there's different levels of detail that you could do for that, right?

It's like, you could do like a five question, just open ended, like, where we hopefully don't get too much friction and people actually answer everything.

And then they can go as detailed or as little as they want versus like a 25 question thing that someone might take a look at and just throw it out and just be like, I'm not doing that.

So there's a, there's a few options that we can consider. I think we want to, we want to provide a way where people can just use it So,

Just provide feedback in multiple ways. then that way, it's just easy for them to do whatever way they want.

How does that sound?

Trevor Bradford
Yeah, the easier, the better for people, as always.

Matthew Kerns
Like for me, if I'm, I'm busy, and I want like, I want all my stuff recorded, I want to like, just as I'm working, it just gets recorded.

There's, it's like, done at the end, like, you know, all my feedback is right there, from me just talking.

So I like that one. But, you know, not everybody's like, the same. So You need to provide multiple routes where it's easy for multiple, um, customer, if you will.

Yeah.

Trevor Bradford
Uh, is it worth having a look at the previous beta test page? and just see what we had there and just see if we've got stuff that might be usable rather than reinvent the wheel.

Yeah, is it this one?

Matthew Kerns
Yeah.

Trevor Bradford
So just tell us who you are. Yeah, the wheel do text needs to be a bit more specific, I think.

Yeah, so it just needs to articulate the fact that we're walking through a process. Treat this as a process.

You start with your avatar, then you do this, then you do that, then you do the other.

Matthew Kerns
Yeah, I think there might be one that does that already. So this is the tester registration, so it's meant to be simple.

Let's see what this one has, the journey. Journey, and then there's Feedback, so Explore Homepage, browse the home page and get familiar with the layout, notice the hero section and main value proposition, check the navigation menu, look for any confusing elements, add notes, cool, yeah, I mean, there's a lot built out already that we can definitely.

ACTION ITEM
Re-enable Beta Test pages; add menu link; open in new tab; then Trevor update copy via Lubbable chat
If we, if we use this, and it should be easy, I guess, if you click on the beta test function, for it to open in a new, in a new tab, so if this sits alongside of the app, when you're going through it, there are your questions, just type in your observations, super easy.

Cool. Yeah, let's do that. And if we can get, if we can reinitiate that onto the menu, so that I can access it, and then I'll go through and just check all the.

The copy and the instructions, just to make sure that it's still relevant to the app as it exists now, as opposed to what this was about then, when Lubbable generated it.

Matthew Kerns
And I would say that you can even, like, it's definitely outdated, like this one has free diagnostic, then there's review diagnostic results.

But there's so much more in the app now that we're gonna need to update this. So I would say, like, when you're reviewing this, you can even review it in Lubbable, like just do what I'm doing right now, just pull up the path, like beta journey, beta feedback, and then just chat with Lubbable and just give it your updates.

And then, um, you can, you can, once you, Have a good idea. I would say you should use this chat feature while you're iterating.

Well, honestly, whatever you want. You don't even have to like.

Trevor Bradford
Well, I haven't been doing anything with it like that, Matt, because I didn't want to be working on it while you were working on it.

And then for there to be confusion over if I broke anything, screwed anything up. Or, you know, was it me?

Was it something that you did? So I have been very hands off since my first build phase with this.

And one of the reasons was because it started to hallucinate and tell me things that weren't true. It had fixed things and done things.

And it looks like it's behaving at the moment. Have you found that? Have you found it performing properly? So.

Matthew Kerns
Yeah. Yes, I have. I don't work too much in Lovable itself. Like, I work outside in Cloud Code because I trust that one more.

But I also, I guess I know more about the underlying how it works behind the scenes. So if it says something, it might tell you something that you just don't know what it's saying.

So whatever works. You can just give me your feedback too. And then I can, I can go in and make the updates.

But if you wanted to play around with it, you could use this chat feature, and then just chat with it and provide me that output.

So that that wouldn't modify anything in the app, if that's something you're more comfortable with. Yes, it is.

Trevor Bradford
Yeah, I'll, I'll explore that. And I I don't really want to stop messing with it and break anything, just make it more work than necessarily.

I'd like to reduce the amount of work, increase the simplicity of the whole thing and just make it as user-friendly as I can.

So me diving in and starting to add stuff in there. It probably isn't the best thing at the moment, but where do I find the beta test journey, Matt?

Matthew Kerns
So that question you just asked me is what I just asked. So if you pull up the chat and you just make sure you toggle this chat, you can ask it that exact question, like where do I find the beta test stuff?

This is all I said. said, do we have beta testing UI in this app? And then it went ahead and gave me this whole report and it tells me.

Like, these are the routes, so like, these are all the routes, so it's like, then you can just come up here and type in the route, and you can see that page.

Yeah.

Trevor Bradford
So what I think I will do is get Lovable's input into this, asking questions and say, look, this is, on this module, what would a beta tester be looking for?

What would you suggest? And I'll do it all in chat, and then I'll share it with you rather than get it to implement it.

And then we'll have something to work with.

Matthew Kerns
Yeah, I would frame it as, as the builder of this website, as we move, like, what is useful for us to collect from beta testers?

Trevor Bradford
Yeah. Keep it open-ended.

Matthew Kerns
Yeah. Yeah, okay.

Trevor Bradford
Yeah, that sounds great.

Matthew Kerns
So I think that will help us get towards the goal of like, you know, beta ready. We definitely need to collect feedback.

Um, so that's awesome. Okay.

Trevor Bradford
Well, I'll make that a task for me. And, uh, and then once, once we've got the beta test output from Lovable, I will then check that output against each module of the tool as I go through it.

So I've got some kind of structured approach to test where we are and make sure that everything works and just see, see how that pans out.

And then I'll share that with you.

Matthew Kerns
Okay. Sounds good. Yeah. I think when you give me your feedback on getting the beta pages ready, I'll probably do something very similar.

And then we can both iterate on it and then get this thing ready to go.

Trevor Bradford
Yeah. I'd like to get it rolling as quickly as possible because AI is moving so fast at the minute that I don't want it to effectively be out of date before we even get it to market.

Yeah.

Matthew Kerns
I think, like, get user feedback is critical because we can do stuff quickly. Like, I sent you an update with one of the new tools I have that's like, we can build stuff quickly.

We just need to know what the heck to build.

Trevor Bradford
So from your point of view as a dev and also a user potentially as well as somebody who is now pretty experienced in the way my frameworks work because you've seen it in the app and you've been a client.

Do you feel that this app as it exists, it's still where it needs Is to be in terms of its viability and its ability to compete with what's happening in this marketplace?

Or have we already been surpassed, do you think?

Matthew Kerns
Well, I would say that some of the interaction is a bit limited. don't know the competitors that well. But I think that the chat interface, I think, can be better.

I think it's, it's decent, it's usable. But like, I really want like a companion that's like a widget that helps me at each at each step.

Because it's kind of like, once I start using the chat feature, I am, I'm on the chat page, but I'm

Disconnected from the lessons and the learnings, so I want it more all together. That might end up being something that comes up.

I think it probably will be something that ends up coming up in the feedback. So that would be the main call out that I have.

But at the end of the day, that's it's like a like a usability like sort of optimization that at the beta testing stage, like I don't know, like as long as it produces good outputs, that's the core value add.

So I think if when you're testing it, if you focus on making sure that the outputs are good and the quality of the outputs is is there.

As long as it's clear how to use it to get to the ultimate brand strategy document and how that's useful in producing content, and if we communicate that well, and we just communicate that we're refining this tool, it's not 100% ready, but we will take all of your feedback into account and refine this thing to make it exactly what you want.

This is just our initial effort, right? Then I think we can get to a good result after the beta testing.

Okay.

Trevor Bradford
Great stuff. I think that covers all the questions I have for the moment until I go through it all.

ACTION ITEM
Send Fathom recording link to Trevor
So, Matt, unless there's anything else for me, probably we should wrap it up there. I think my wife. It's cooking dinner, and she'll be banging on the door at the minute, saying it's ready to stay here.

Matthew Kerns
Yeah, okay, I'll let you go to dinner, and then I'll send you this Fathom link as well, and then I'll follow up on all this stuff, and we'll be in touch.

Great stuff. Thanks, Matt.
