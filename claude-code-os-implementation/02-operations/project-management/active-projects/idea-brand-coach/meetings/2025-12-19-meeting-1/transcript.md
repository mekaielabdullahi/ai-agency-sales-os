0:00 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
This meeting is being recorded.

0:04 - Trevor Bradford
How are things?

0:06 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Doing good. Doing pretty good. Yeah, how are you doing?

0:12 - Trevor Bradford
Yeah, not bad. Getting close to Christmas, isn't it? And the holiday period.

0:17 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Yeah.

0:18 - Trevor Bradford
Yeah. On Christmas Day, I'll be gone for about 10 days, going to Mexico. I think I told you, I?

0:25 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Nice.

0:26 - Trevor Bradford
Yeah. So lots of stuff on my desk that needs to be cleared before then.

0:33 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Yeah, yeah. I've been super busy. And I don't have plans for the holidays this year much, but I'll probably just keep working through this time. But yeah, just been busy. hope you have a great time on your trip.

0:54 - Trevor Bradford
Yeah, I'm really looking forward to it, actually. Be nice to get a break. Been a hard year this year.

0:59 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
go. to Yeah. So I've made progress on things that we followed up that we said we need to follow up on. I think there's some more details that I still want to fix up that, like, we need to, I don't think we necessarily need to go over them again. I think there's some things that, like, we already talked about that I probably need to clean up, but I can show you where it's at right now. The collapsible video thing was pretty straightforward.

1:44 - Trevor Bradford
Well, I mean, before we get into that, Matt, for me, all my notes are in that float that I shared with you and the stuff that I tested that doesn't yet work. And I was playing around with it today as well, but we'll, we'll, we'll talk about. We'll about the way that Brand Coach treats new chats in a minute, because it's a bit detailed. So why don't we cover off the smaller stuff that you want to share, and then we can talk about that.

2:14 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Okay, sounds good. Yeah, I've been a bit delayed on working on this just because I have a couple other client projects that I've needed to prioritize. So I apologize if I haven't got to some of the Freeform stuff, but I just wanted to mention that.

2:41 - Trevor Bradford
Okay, well, it would be great to catch up to a point where I can actually put it into beta, because I'm seeing similar propositions to mine now beginning to pop up elsewhere. And I've been working on this thing for probably too long. And, you know, without necessarily getting it to where it's used. So, you know, I need now to actually say, okay, well, what it does is what it does. And that's enough to launch it, but it needs to do what it's supposed to. And, and we're, we're not, we're not really there yet.

3:18 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Okay. Um, yeah, let's definitely hone in on what those things are.

3:23 - Trevor Bradford
Yeah.

3:23 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Um, I don't understand why am I trying to admit the meeting recorder or the Fathom note to your, oh, it does say recording and taking notes.
ACTION ITEM: Share Fathom notes w/ Matthew - WATCH: https://fathom.video/share/wxNdP5K95z7eyhbzuLk1EcRNxMxNYXcb?timestamp=204.9999

3:34 - Trevor Bradford
Okay. Mine's taking notes as well. So, you know, I can, I can share those with you.

3:41 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Okay. Sounds good. So let me know if you once, if you can see my screen.

3:53 - Trevor Bradford
No, I just, I just see your, your headshot, Matt.
SCREEN SHARING: Matthew started screen sharing - WATCH: https://fathom.video/share/wxNdP5K95z7eyhbzuLk1EcRNxMxNYXcb?timestamp=241.416675

3:58 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Okay. Oh, there we go. I think now that works. Okay, now can you see it?

4:08 - Trevor Bradford
Uh, no. Yeah, let's come on now.

4:15 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Okay, so updated the brand avatar to Avatar 2.0, then removed the diagnostic thing from up here. There's this start here page. So this one, this is what the collapsible video looks like right now. So if you click it and open it, you know, we get this video that you can, I think it works well. Yeah, I think it works as well. I added this. So I think this is the right email that you wanted.

4:56 - Trevor Bradford
Is that right? Yeah, it is. Yeah. Uh, I've got, uh, Lovable open at the moment, but are you working on a separate platform?

5:05 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Yeah, this is my local, so I can, I didn't want to push it yet in case like it was interfering with, like I want to keep the environment separate because sometimes I don't know if you've published or if you're working on something and you want to publish it live. So, I like to do my changes on my computer and then, yeah, I think that was sort of the main thing, it, basically, I think it, we had said, so, this was the homepage, I don't think we necessarily wanted to have a journey one, but, I don't hate the idea, but I wonder what you think about that, and then there's this drop. down here. But this is kind of like the homepage that you wanted to reinstate, right? So did we want to have this page be the start here one? And I guess I'm just wondering how does this stuff all look if we're also wanting to show all this? Like maybe it's better to have two separate pages. I'm not sure.

6:31 - Trevor Bradford
I'm just looking at my flow to see where we were last conversation we had, because it's been a bit of time since we had our last chat. Yeah, we said we're going to reinstate that page. Or did we say we're going to bring it back? I'm a bit confused. Oh, I remember. Yeah, you've done what the flow says. So the original page without the video on it, your strategic brand building journey only has one module that's functional, which is the inside one. All the others are educational. So I think I said that we could probably put video links on each of those pages, didn't I? And that once we've got the app actually functioning, I can then put training on how to use it on the on the app in video form on each one of those pages, because I think I've got to give users something more than it currently gives them on that on that on those links to those modules. For example, the I'll zoom in a bit, the distinctive module and the empathetic and authentic, they don't have a great deal on there on those pages. And so they're, in a way, a little bit redundant. So you're closer to this almost than me now because you've worked on it since we spoke last. So why don't you talk me through the process as you see it, as a developer, and let's see how it sits now.

8:42 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
So I think, at a high level, I think that we are sort of like, well, the way that our plan to launch by the end of the year was to cut out a lot of the features and the And Thank And I think that, and to focus on the key, the core value add, which is the GPT, like getting people to be able to use the GPT, and use it with data from, you know, the avatar builder and the brand canvas. So I think that, since the last time, like since our last meeting, we've started to kind of dive back into the training modules. So I think we need to decide what is, what we want to do for beta. Like, and the thing also is, if we have, like, you've paid me 1000 to get it to a certain state, right? And I want to make sure... That I've delivered what we've agreed upon for that, and then basically I can do some things to make small changes and even several small changes to get us in line with that vision for the beta launch. And like the core functionality, but I think once we start adding more features and adding like discussion about the training modules and like there's so many more things, like if we can keep it simple, then I'm fine to do it.

10:48 - Trevor Bradford
I don't want to add any more features, Matt. I think I've been clear about that all the way through, that less is more for this, but what is there has to actually work. The lovable version that I've been exploring, it doesn't. It has a number of failure points along its process. For example, anything that we do on the avatar, anything that we develop on insights, it's not adding it to the brand canvas. And as we said last time, that's a really poor customer experience. So we should be able to have a simple function, I think, that is about, if you like what has been generated, you can either, you can save it to your canvas, or you can decide, no, no, I want to rerun that through the GPT again, because I don't like, I don't like the output. And when you're satisfied with it, you just add it to canvas. And, and all the way through, we just need to be able to have this document that's building so that at the end of it, the user's got this strategy document, and it's been azię, It's simple as, put your inputs in, get the response, do I like it, yes, save, that's it, and so that there's a document at the end of it, which was the purpose of Brand Canvas, and at the moment, the version on Lovable keeps prompting you to start over with the framework, and it just doesn't flow, and it doesn't follow a logical process, as far as I can see. It's what Lovable built, but it's never worked properly in that way, and so that was what I wanted to get sorted out, without adding more to the app, you know, in fact, I'm happy to take things away from it, if we have to, but I think it's really important that the things that it does do, are captured and remembered, and by the app itself, and you can output them. Now, that said, the problem is that it is Remembering on Brand Coach, and everything that I ask it, it refers back to the project that I started, the H4H skincare project. And even when I was testing it again today with stuff about my brand, it was still referring to the H4H brand.
ACTION ITEM: Remove framework restart prompts; enable Brand Canvas export - WATCH: https://fathom.video/share/wxNdP5K95z7eyhbzuLk1EcRNxMxNYXcb?timestamp=804.9999 So it's not joined up there somehow, or its memory is stuck on the one project. And I don't know, I don't know how to fix that, it's out of my scope of ability, I'm afraid, but it doesn't work.

13:35 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Okay, so I think two things that I can see is, so one, we can, I mean, we can scrap this, like, so, well, the first thing is like, just getting everything into the brand canvas export. I think that, as long as I stay focused on that, I should be able to do that. Um..255 As part of like what we already agreed on. And then for this, I noticed you said that it keeps telling you to go back. Like, what if we just remove this entire thing right now?

14:19 - Trevor Bradford
Yeah.

14:19 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Okay. Okay. So we can do those two things. And then for the brand coach, I think the assumption for the simple app was that we have, like, each person that uses it has one brand, one avatar, or like the way that it's set up right now, right, is that there's one brand, one avatar, but for your use case, like you want to use it for multiple brands and maybe like one of the So target avatars for this website is somebody who has multiple brands. That I'm not sure. But what we could do if so, I would actually want an answer to that to figure out what to do because like there's a workaround that what you could do is you could create a separate sort of dummy email. For each brand that you work with and create a separate account. Because I would imagine actually like, for the avatar stuff, like if you're working with the GPT, and if you're using the avatar 2.0 and filling out all that stuff, which I'm not sure you are, then it would make sense to have a completely separate email and account. But, so... . . . If you're not using Avatar 2.0, then that raises a question of, like, what's the best way that we want this, like, what would be, like, what I think is the best, is the easiest way for you to use this is if we have, like, just a knowledge document upload that would populate the Avatar 2.0. So you can see your answer, you can see all your brand content, like, broken out once you upload the knowledge documents inside this tool, right, and you can make edits and stuff. And then the brand coach, like, for ease of use for you, like, the ideal thing would be to have a dropdown where you can switch between brands, right?

16:57 - Trevor Bradford
Yeah. Yeah. Well, I... The ideal thing for me would be for it to work like ChatGPT works, where you start a new chat and you start over. And although the ChatGPT, if you've worked with it long enough, it remembers who you are and what your conversations have been about. It doesn't automatically default to the previous brand conversation that you had. And that makes perfect sense, doesn't it? It's a new chat. It's a new topic. It's a new conversation. So that's the way that I thought this was going to work because, you know, when you suggested that we had your chats down the side, which we're looking at in your screen at the minute, those in theory should work in the same way as ChatGPT. It's a new conversation. But on the lovable iteration, it's referring back to the avatar and all the preliminary steps. That's that I'd taken for the H4H brand, and not mine. So the functionality there isn't working properly. And it isn't logical either. You know, from the end user's point of view, they're completely familiar now working with GPTs. And if we're delivering something that looks like a GPT to them, they're going to expect it to work. In the same way, naturally.

18:32 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Well, the way that we've built the app so far is that it's like very much one brand. Like the brand canvas has information about your brand. The avatar 2.0 has information about one avatar. So the way that the chat works now is it pulls from all those fields and it pulls from all the And it's the expectation is that it's one brand. So that's the way it's currently built.

19:08 - Trevor Bradford
So that's why it works that way.

19:10 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Okay.

19:10 - Trevor Bradford
So if we were to offer an option somehow for them to start a new brand conversation, then that new brand conversation effectively gives them access to the whole flow again from avatar, even brand diagnostic if they wanted, I guess. All the way through without it referencing the previous brand content that they put in there. Right. That's what we're saying, right? Yeah. Well, that could work as well, so long as it's clear that that's what they have to do.

19:47 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Yeah. I think we could make it pretty clear. Like we could put something in the top bar that kind of is like a brand selector. And then... So they can switch between brands and then the rest of it.

20:04 - Trevor Bradford
Well, you know, that makes sense to me, Matt, because in Titan's tools, if you've got multiple stores, you can switch between stores from a drop-down menu. And then once you've told the app at the top level of the flow which store you want to drill down into, and you've selected it, then it takes you down that flow. And it doesn't access any of your sales data from a different store because it's on a completely different flow. And is that what you're describing to me?

20:36 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
I think it is, isn't it? Yeah, exactly. That's the cleanest way to keep all the information separate between across different brands.

20:45 - Trevor Bradford
Okay.

20:47 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
If you want that for one user. A workaround right now without doing any extra work is just to have separate email. separate logins. So you could create. So for the product itself, I sort of want to come back to that question of who's going to be using this? Who's the end user? Like, is it someone who's exploring multiple brands? Or is it more someone who is using it for one brand?

21:25 - Trevor Bradford
Well, it could well be. I can see a number of use cases. I can see a use case where someone's starting out, they don't have much of a brand knowledge document at all, and they're starting from scratch. And they want to get a strategy doc built properly. That's entry level in a way. Next level is they've got more than one brand. So they probably want to be working on more than one brand. If they are themselves an independent consultant, and they want... To buy access to this tool to use to deliver strategy to their clients, because maybe they're a designer who wants to be able to offer more strategy, for example, then I could see where they would want to work on multiple brands.

22:17 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Yeah.

22:18 - Trevor Bradford
And that would make perfect sense as well. And even for the beginners, if they're just starting out and they're trying to figure out what brand they want to invest in, they could also use the multiple brand feature. Yes, that's right. You know, could see a use case for that, too.

22:38 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Okay. Because it's a framework for developing a brand, so, yeah, I mean, you can, you should be able to iterate on one brand and then also, you know, explore multiple brands, like creative people like to jump around. So.

23:02 - Trevor Bradford
Yeah. So I just think it needs to be logical and clear. I think the closer it mirrors people's working experience of ChatGPT or similar, the easier they're going to find it to use, and the less we're going to need instructional video and training. Although I will do a series of videos on each of these tools that whether or not they're integrated into the app at some point, they will be there available. And I'll provide a link to effectively a training course as well so that there's a course on the IDEA framework. And then this is the tool that you use to deliver what you've been taught in the course. And that's my thinking on that. And I think that's a way for me to deliver. And therefore, be able to charge a decent price for it, as opposed to it looking like a wrapper around a GPT, which I think the market's already moved beyond that, really. And people who are developing apps are doing some quite sophisticated stuff like Danny McMillan, for example. I don't know if you know Danny. He does Seller Sessions. He's developed this really very clever thing. It's a bit complicated, actually, but when you're giving that away for free, I don't know how he's going to make any money out of that, maybe as a recruitment tool or something. And then there's Anthony inside the network. He's doing this design app. And you said that you've seen that, and so you know what he's doing.

24:50 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Yeah. The model of giving software for free is kind of, it's kind of an expectation. I with software, actually. Most softwares do that. They offer a free tier where they give you a lot of cool stuff. And then even like ChatGPT and these websites, they give you a free tier of usage so that you can explore it and try it out for yourself.
ACTION ITEM: Review Danny McMillan's Seller Sessions tool - WATCH: https://fathom.video/share/wxNdP5K95z7eyhbzuLk1EcRNxMxNYXcb?timestamp=1525.9999 And then once people like it and they want to use it, then there's a limit. And then basically, that's when softwares generally start charging. And so that's where I think to refine the product, I definitely want to take a look at Danny McMillan's. But also, like, I think we should think about the offer itself and how much we would want to give for free. at Danny McMillan's. We get users and then at what point we do upsells based on anticipated customer needs. So like once they've filled in, once they've tried it out a little bit and they've got some value, then right when they want to like dive in more and really go deep with it, then it's kind of like, okay, now you need to pay like 20 a month or whatever. It is for the next level up. And then for even more advanced features, like maybe if you want to do multiple brands, then you need to be on the $50 a month tier. I'm not sure what, but that's just sort of the general idea.

26:47 - Trevor Bradford
Yeah, no, I can see that. And the way to avoid having to give stuff too much stuff away for free is to make it part of the training on the framework. Which- ... ... ... you There's the book, of course, you can start with the book, you learn the framework from the book, but people never implement half of what they read, you know, they come to huddles, we come to conversion work parties, we tell them what to do, and they don't implement it. So nine times out of 10, most books aren't even fully finished, not they're not read all the way through. Most training courses go that way, to some degree, so my objective is to say, okay, look, here's the training, and here are all the tools that will deliver the output for you. All you've got to do is do some typing and press some buttons, and you're going to get the strategy output. So what that basically means is that I'm not out there trying to sell software. I'm out there coaching, effectively offering coaching and the first level. The of coaching is the course, with the tool. And if you want one-to-one coaching, then you can hire me. So that's another level. If you want to be part of some kind of community where we meet every month, or twice a month maybe, that's a different proposition as well. So what I like to do is try and avoid the disaggregation of the software from the actual knowledge. Because what this isn't necessarily, you with Antonis, let's take Antonis as an example, or Tannis, they are all about hands-on, nuts and bolts stuff. So it's a purely functional piece of software in a way, at least the way I see it. It's like any other... It's thing that you bought. Say it's Canva, you want to design stuff. It's functional. It doesn't teach you to be a designer necessarily. It's a tool. It's a design tool.

29:15 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
So it gives you outputs.

29:17 - Trevor Bradford
It gives you outputs and that's what this does. It gives you outputs. But what I want to be able to offer people is the understanding of the framework itself and why it will deliver better outputs. Because of the way that you approach the whole strategic brand piece.

29:35 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Yeah, because the outputs of this application should, the way I see it is, that should be used as inputs to, you know, graphic designer if they use a tool. And that, feeding this, the stuff that this outputs, should deliver like a really good customer.

30:17 - Trevor Bradford
So we could say to the brand coach, based on my brand canvas, which I downloaded, I now have a PDF document that I can re-upload if I Or access in some way at brand coach level. So brand coach therefore knows everything that we've agreed about the brand strategy so far. And it's all there. And then I say to it, write me a design brief for my Amazon listing. I've given you the bullet points and the title. Now design, give me a design brief for the primary image stack and the A plus content. Okay, that's great. great. Now give me a script for my video, my talking head video, if that's what I'm doing, or my product demo video. That's great. Now give me however many posts based on that strategy for social media. And because the brand coach is plugged into ChatGPT, it should be able to deliver all of that, but in an informed way, not in the general way that ChatGPT does. If it doesn't know anything about what you're asking, it goes out to the web and tries to find the answers, whereas obviously, we've got a knowledge base, you know, with the brand coach that it draws upon. That's why you get better outputs. That's the whole proposition, really, that you could ask the same questions to ChatGPT generally, and it will just come back with generic stuff it's found out on the web. It will always give you the same . Brand strategy steps, you know, that aren't tailored to your particular brand or your niche or any understanding of the brand to any degree that you have as the brand owner. And that's what I wanted to avoid with this, that we trained the app on the brand because we've actually built the brand by using the app. And then we can ask it questions that it should deliver strategic responses that are absolutely bang on the money because of that.

32:32 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Yeah, and I think an important point that you touched on and that we touched on is the outputs of this. So, like, the difference between, like, the other softwares, it's very clear what the outputs are because it's like, okay, yeah, you get an image, right, for AMZ Design Kit or whatever, Canva. Like, what if we, what I'm thinking is, like, what if, what I'm imagining is, like, on this... Right side of the screen here, if we have just a to do list or a checklist of like, these are the things so, so I'm sort of imagining two checklists, the bottom checklist is like, maybe they upload like, okay, I need to produce a plus content this week, I need to produce secondary images and posts, right. And then they sort of upload what they need. And then you have a to do list and the top that's, that's your brand coaches suggestions for what you need, what are the prerequisites to produce those that you can work on in this app. And then as you design those, and as you create those, it, it checks them off the list, and you can download the strategic outputs. So those things will be like an input, each one of those things will be the input. So we were just talking about Fathom, 12kernsmatthew.com, and were talking Fathom, Bradford, and 12kernsmatthew Yeah, that's a pretty good summary, Matt.

34:36 - Trevor Bradford
So what I wanted to do is for a user who, for whatever reason, either can't afford or doesn't want to work one-to-one with me yet, to get the same kind of quality of outputs that I delivered for you, which Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. There's a deep delve into the opportunity to see it from a completely different direction than the one that they're looking at right now before they've taken the brand through the process. I mean, where you and I on your brand were when we started was it was a black box. Yeah. And where you can end up. We're about to lose the Zoom meeting. Yeah. We can log back in. But where you can end up with that strategy if you implement it fully is your can end That's
