Meeting Purpose

Define the Brand Canvas AI's core functionality and output requirements.

Key Takeaways

- The Brand Canvas AI is broken; it provides generic instructions instead of generating actual brand strategy content.
- The core fix is to make the "Get AI Suggestions" button generate and apply a complete, context-aware output directly to the field.
- The target output is a structured, actionable brand strategy document, not a list of prompts.
- Trevor's successful manual ChatGPT process for a client will be used as the blueprint for the app's backend logic.

Topics

Problem: AI Generates Instructions, Not Content

- The "Get AI Suggestions" button provides generic instructions (e.g., "Clarify the target audience") and examples, not a specific output for the user's brand.
- Applying these "suggestions" simply pastes the instructions and incomplete example text into the field, failing to generate usable content.
- Why this is critical: The app must deliver a complete, actionable strategy document. This bug makes the AI feature unusable and prevents the app from fulfilling its purpose.

Solution: Generate & Apply Context-Aware Content

- The AI must generate a complete output for each field, using all available user context (e.g., Avatar, previous Brand Canvas inputs).
- Two User Paths:
  - No existing content: AI generates a complete statement from scratch.
  - Existing content: AI improves the user's statement.
- The "Get AI Suggestions" button should trigger this generation and automatically populate the field, with an "Accept" or "Reject" option.

Blueprint: Trevor's Manual ChatGPT Process

- Trevor demonstrated a successful manual process using ChatGPT to create a comprehensive brand strategy for a client.
- Process:
  - Upload meeting notes.
  - Direct the AI to analyze notes and generate specific outputs (e.g., brand architecture, manifesto).
  - Provide specific inputs (e.g., brand story narrative) to guide the AI.
- Key Insight: This proves a standard GPT can produce high-quality, structured strategy documents when given the right inputs and direction.
- Action: Trevor will share the ChatGPT thread with Matthew to serve as the blueprint for the app's backend logic and prompting strategy.

Next Steps

- Matthew:
  - Fix the "Get AI Suggestions" button to generate and apply context-aware content directly to Brand Canvas fields.
  - Use Trevor's shared ChatGPT thread as the blueprint for the backend logic and prompting strategy.
- Trevor: - Share the "H4H brand strategy" ChatGPT thread with Matthew via WhatsApp.
