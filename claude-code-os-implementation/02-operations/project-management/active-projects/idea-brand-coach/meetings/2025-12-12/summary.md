## Meeting Purpose

Review app feedback and define next steps for a beta-ready launch.

---

## Key Takeaways

- **Beta-Ready Goal:** The app must be functional and cohesive for beta testing. The primary success metric is a single, comprehensive output document that integrates all user inputs from the Avatar Builder and Brand Canvas.
- **UI/UX Overhaul:** The UI will be simplified by removing the confusing "Interactive Insight" module and replacing the "Start Here" page with the reinstated "Strategic Brand Building Journey" page.
- **Video-First Guidance:** The app will use short, collapsible instructional videos with transcripts on key pages to guide users and keep the UI clean.
- **AI Output Quality:** The Copy Generator's output quality will be improved by hooking it to the user's knowledge base. Matthew will also research connecting users' personal ChatGPT accounts to leverage their existing context.

## Topics

### Beta-Ready Goal

- **Objective:** Fix critical bugs and integrate all user inputs into a single output document to enable beta testing.
- **Rationale:** User feedback is essential before investing in new features. The current fragmented output is a major blocker to usability.

### UI/UX Simplification

- **"Start Here" Page:** Replaced with the reinstated "Strategic Brand Building Journey" page.
  - **Rationale:** The original page provides crucial context for the "IDEA" framework (Insight, Distinctive, Empathy, Authenticity) that was lost in the simplified version.
- **"Interactive Insight" Module:** Removed to reduce user confusion and UI clutter.
  - **Rationale:** The module is redundant, as its concepts are already covered in the Avatar Builder.
- **Brand Diagnostic:** Removed from the main navigation.
  - **Rationale:** It is the pre-login lead magnet; keeping it in-app is confusing.

### Output Document & PDF Generation

- **Problem:** Inconsistent and poorly formatted output documents (PDFs vs. Markdown).
- **Solution:** Standardize on a single, text-based output format for all reports.
  - **Rationale:** Ensures a consistent user experience.
  - **Logo:** Remove the stretched logo and replace it with a simple text heading (e.g., "IDEA Brand Coach - Customer Avatar Report").
  - **Formatting:** Ensure the text is well-spaced and readable, avoiding "widows" (single words on a line).

### Avatar Builder Enhancements

- **Live Preview:** The live preview will be hidden by default to reduce clutter.
  - **New Flow:** A "Preview" button will toggle the preview on/off, and a "Download" button will export the report in the same format.
- **Input Fields:**
  - **Comma-Separated Values:** The "+" button will be updated to add comma-separated inputs as individual items.
  - **AI Assistant:** An "AI Assistant" button will be added to suggest "Decision Factors" in the Buying Behavior section.
- **Document Pre-fill:** Explore adding a feature to pre-fill the Avatar Builder using the user's uploaded knowledge documents.
  - **Rationale:** Reduces manual data entry and leverages existing user work.

### Copy Generator & AI Output Quality

- **Problem:** The Copy Generator produced generic output because it was not connected to the user's knowledge base.
- **Solution:** Matthew has connected the generator to the knowledge base; Trevor will re-test for improved results.
- **Future Enhancement:** Research connecting users' personal ChatGPT accounts.
  - **Rationale:** To leverage their existing, personalized context and improve output quality.

### Training & Guidance

- **Strategy:** Use short, collapsible instructional videos with transcripts on key pages.
  - **Rationale:** Provides in-context guidance without cluttering the UI.
  - **Transcripts:** Trevor will provide transcripts, which Matthew will make viewable and copyable in-app.

## Next Steps

### Matthew:
- Create a task list for the beta-ready launch, focusing on the single-document output.
- Send the task list to Trevor for review before starting work.
- Research connecting users' personal ChatGPT accounts.

### Trevor:
- Create instructional videos and transcripts for key pages (e.g., "Strategic Brand Building Journey," Avatar Builder).
- Re-test the Copy Generator after Matthew's update to verify improved output quality.
