**Meeting Date:** 2026-01-23
**Duration:** ~2h

[00:00:04] **Matthew Kerns**: Okay, so I have this idea.

[00:00:08] **Matthew Kerns**: So basically, in the brand coach page, the brand canvas, so I had this idea to like...

[00:00:26] **Matthew Kerns**: So we have the chat interface that's siloed off into this brand coach, right?

[00:00:33] **Matthew Kerns**: And you can chat with it there.

[00:00:36] **Matthew Kerns**: It's, in my opinion, it's a bit clunky.

[00:00:39] **Matthew Kerns**: It's like, okay, say something here, and then I get a response way down here.

[00:00:47] **Matthew Kerns**: And it's kind of, it's not like the best experience, in my opinion.

[00:00:54] **Matthew Kerns**: So what I was thinking is...

[00:00:57] **Matthew Kerns**: was thinking is...

[00:00:58] **Matthew Kerns**: What I You

[00:01:02] **Matthew Kerns**: Where did that go?

[00:01:03] **Matthew Kerns**: So what I was thinking is to have a chat widget that just shows up over here.

[00:01:12] **Matthew Kerns**: I wonder if it's...

[00:01:14] **Matthew Kerns**: Where did it go?

[00:01:14] **Matthew Kerns**: I just had it.

[00:01:25] **Matthew Kerns**: Data feedback, beta journey.

[00:01:28] **Matthew Kerns**: So these are like interactive things that I just added for the beta testing feedback.

[00:01:36] **Matthew Kerns**: This one will take you to this page.

[00:01:39] **Matthew Kerns**: I had to hold command click to do that one, by the way.

[00:01:45] **Matthew Kerns**: Wow, I really need a haircut.

[00:01:48] **Matthew Kerns**: But okay, so get AI guidance.

[00:01:52] **Matthew Kerns**: That button could be better.

[00:01:55] **Matthew Kerns**: This one...

[00:01:56] **Matthew Kerns**: Hold on.

[00:01:57] **Matthew Kerns**: My focus was supposed to be the widget.

[00:02:13] **Matthew Kerns**: So this one has some suggestions and it's better formatted now.

[00:02:24] **Matthew Kerns**: This one will pre-fill the field, right?

[00:02:29] **Matthew Kerns**: So we have a guidance.

[00:02:33] **Matthew Kerns**: We have something that generates text that can just go directly there.

[00:02:42] **Matthew Kerns**: And now this field is auto-sized instead of a person having to adjust it.

[00:02:49] **Matthew Kerns**: So like if I delete this, it will adjust the size automatically, which is cool.

[00:02:53] **Matthew Kerns**: But I had this idea to put a chat widget right here.

[00:02:57] **Matthew Kerns**: I don't know why it's not visible right now.

[00:02:58] **Matthew Kerns**: Yeah.

[00:02:59] **Matthew Kerns**: don't know.

[00:02:59] **Matthew Kerns**: I don't don't know.

[00:03:16] **Matthew Kerns**: Then, let's see if there's an error, nope, I don't know, that might be wrong.

[00:03:33] **Matthew Kerns**: So, there's a chat widget, there's the coach where you can see all the conversations, there's this thing where you click a button and it suggests things for you, but you can't really talk with it, and the widget over here, you can talk with it, but it can't update over here.

[00:03:48] **Matthew Kerns**: So, what I was thinking is, why don't we just, why don't we just have, what?

[00:03:59] **Matthew Kerns**: Thank

[00:04:01] **Matthew Kerns**: Screen share stopped.

[00:04:03] **Matthew Kerns**: I don't know when it stopped but hopefully you can see it now.

[00:04:07] **Matthew Kerns**: So the idea was maybe if I do window it won't mess it but okay so the idea was we would have a chat basically you can chat with this like I want to be able to chat with this and be like I don't like what it said here can we update this you know but this is just a button and there's no like you just wait and you're waiting and you don't get to say what you're thinking and you have to manually update so I want to I want to use natural language to update this like make it shorter make it more comprehensive whatever whatever

[00:05:04] **Matthew Kerns**: And I'm to just pull it all together right now, so.

[00:05:26] **Matthew Kerns**: Okay, I'll check for errors.

[00:05:50] **Matthew Kerns**: I need to update suit updates manually.

[00:05:55] **Matthew Kerns**: I've heard that before.

[00:05:57] **Matthew Kerns**: Thank you.

[00:05:57] **Matthew Kerns**: Thank you.

[00:05:58] **Matthew Kerns**: Thank you.

[00:05:59] **Matthew Kerns**: Thank you.

[00:05:59] **Matthew Kerns**: you.

[00:05:59] **Matthew Kerns**: Thank

[00:06:17] **Matthew Kerns**: Okay, here's the widget.

[00:06:18] **Matthew Kerns**: So this widget, you can talk with it, it starts with the previous conversation, which I don't like that.

[00:06:25] **Matthew Kerns**: I don't want to have it start with a new chat.

[00:06:33] **Matthew Kerns**: It's because I was on the, this is so slow.

[00:06:42] **Matthew Kerns**: Interactive Insight page, oh, it's because I was on the Interactive Insight page.

[00:06:49] **Matthew Kerns**: When I pull up the Brand Canvas page, it's there, which is fine.

[00:07:16] **Matthew Kerns**: Yes, and let's make it start from a new chat, but still have other conversations.

[00:07:41] **Matthew Kerns**: To interact with previous conversations, the user needs to click the button that's available in the widget to go to the Brand Coach page or just go to the Brand Coach page.

[00:07:54] **Matthew Kerns**: Thank you.

[00:07:56] **Matthew Kerns**: Thank you.

[00:07:57] **Matthew Kerns**: Thank you.

[00:07:59] **Matthew Kerns**: Thank

[00:08:23] **Matthew Kerns**: This is because I need to update that.

[00:08:32] **Matthew Kerns**: We're going to Superbase, we're going to update the function, also called SQL Editor, okay so I'm just updating table names, I mean table, SQL Editor, table field values and stuff, boom, see if it succeeds, it did.

[00:08:58] **Matthew Kerns**: you.

[00:08:59] **Matthew Kerns**: Thank

[00:09:10] **Matthew Kerns**: Okay, so now to generate because there's nothing there.

[00:09:18] **Matthew Kerns**: Okay, so we're asking to generate, field avatar name, help user customer avatar, the name should be descriptive and memorable to generate a new avatar name based on my brand strategy and avatar data.

[00:09:36] **Matthew Kerns**: Okay, so this is the idea.

[00:09:39] **Matthew Kerns**: Let's see.

[00:09:45] **Matthew Kerns**: It says AI assistant at the top.

[00:09:51] **Matthew Kerns**: Can we name to brand coach?

[00:11:23] **Matthew Kerns**: Okay, well, look at this, all the chat history is just right here.

[00:11:31] **Matthew Kerns**: Brand coach, you can see those ones, you can see by the field.

[00:11:39] **Matthew Kerns**: That's pretty cool.

[00:11:50] **Matthew Kerns**: So there's a lot of output here.

[00:11:52] **Matthew Kerns**: I don't want to read all that.

[00:11:54] **Matthew Kerns**: So maybe we refine that.

[00:12:05] **Matthew Kerns**: The output is too lengthy for the field chat.

[00:12:24] **Matthew Kerns**: Let's make it very concise and user-friendly.

[00:12:28] **Matthew Kerns**: So the user doesn't have to read a whole lot, but they see high quality suggestions for updating that field and maybe a couple of options.

[00:12:50] **Matthew Kerns**: There needs to be a way for the field chat to...

[00:12:56] **Matthew Kerns**: ...

[00:12:57] **Matthew Kerns**: ...

[00:12:57] **Matthew Kerns**: ...

[00:12:57] **Matthew Kerns**: ...

[00:12:59] **Matthew Kerns**: ...

[00:12:59] **Matthew Kerns**: ...

[00:12:59] **Matthew Kerns**: ...

[00:12:59] **Matthew Kerns**: ...

[00:13:00] **Matthew Kerns**: Enable the user to chat with the brand coach to come up with a good description for the field, and then click a button once it's ready and the chat widget window exits, and the text automatically updates the field.

[00:13:41] **Matthew Kerns**: So they don't need to do any copy and pasting, and they don't even need to exit the window or the widget overlay, they just...

[00:14:00] **Matthew Kerns**: Just hit the Accept button, or Update button, and they're back on the page, and the field is updated, and the text window is resized, and the experience is seamless.

[00:14:24] **Matthew Kerns**: Okay.

[00:14:24] **Matthew Kerns**: Let's check it out.

[00:14:45] **Matthew Kerns**: Okay, so that continues the same chat.

[00:14:50] **Matthew Kerns**: While it's working on that, let's just see if this works.

[00:14:52] **Matthew Kerns**: Okay, so yeah, so there's a new chat every time you open the window, which is good.

[00:14:58] **Matthew Kerns**: What if I do...

[00:15:00] **Matthew Kerns**: Okay.

[00:15:01] **Matthew Kerns**: Let's work on this.

[00:15:07] **Matthew Kerns**: So there's some feedback there.

[00:15:10] **Matthew Kerns**: I think it's not exactly the best, but, like, maybe it's good for now.

[00:15:17] **Matthew Kerns**: The user can tell it's working.

[00:15:24] **Matthew Kerns**: So, yeah.

[00:15:25] **Matthew Kerns**: Let's see how this thing does.

[00:15:28] **Matthew Kerns**: Let me click Use This.

[00:15:31] **Matthew Kerns**: Okay.

[00:15:31] **Matthew Kerns**: That should be good.

[00:15:32] **Matthew Kerns**: Let's see what it did.

[00:15:33] **Matthew Kerns**: But, yeah, let's work on this.

[00:15:35] **Matthew Kerns**: See, that's more what I want, where it says...

[00:15:45] **Matthew Kerns**: We're going to need to refine this experience because it outputs so much every time.

[00:15:54] **Matthew Kerns**: Okay.

[00:15:54] **Matthew Kerns**: But right now I just wanted to test...

[00:15:58] **Matthew Kerns**: Okay, cool.

[00:15:58] **Matthew Kerns**: So it's on the same page.

[00:15:59] **Matthew Kerns**: and...

[00:16:00] **Matthew Kerns**: And it just opens the same thing, right?

[00:16:05] **Matthew Kerns**: Now I added one to here, does this, okay, there's a bit of a bug there, but it did open a new chat, so that's fine for now.

[00:16:18] **Matthew Kerns**: So, okay, so let's say for avatar, let's work on this again.

[00:16:27] **Matthew Kerns**: Now, I wanna like clear this, but let's just do, and we enable a clear conversation button on the field chat widget so I can clear the past noisy history and start.

[00:17:01] **Matthew Kerns**: Over.

[00:17:06] **Matthew Kerns**: Just within the scope of this field chat, it should not clear a bunch of user knowledge history.

[00:17:25] **Matthew Kerns**: I'll send this.

[00:17:27] **Matthew Kerns**: Let's see.

[00:17:44] **Matthew Kerns**: Okay.

[00:17:44] **Matthew Kerns**: Okay.

[00:17:44] **Matthew Kerns**: Okay.

[00:17:45] **Matthew Kerns**: Okay.

[00:17:45] **Matthew Kerns**: Okay.

[00:17:45] **Matthew Kerns**: Okay.

[00:17:46] **Matthew Kerns**: Okay.

[00:17:59] **Matthew Kerns**: Okay.

[00:18:00] **Matthew Kerns**: It's not doing what asked.

[00:18:32] **Matthew Kerns**: Thank you.

[00:19:05] **Matthew Kerns**: Thank you.

[00:19:31] **Matthew Kerns**: I thought we already worked on that.

[00:19:36] **Matthew Kerns**: Use this.

[00:19:39] **Matthew Kerns**: Thank you.

[00:19:45] **Matthew Kerns**: Thank you.

[00:19:47] **Matthew Kerns**: Thank you.

[00:19:56] **Matthew Kerns**: Thank you.

[00:19:58] **Matthew Kerns**: Thank you.

[00:19:59] **Matthew Kerns**: you.

[00:19:59] **Matthew Kerns**: you.

[00:19:59] **Matthew Kerns**: Thank

[00:20:11] **Matthew Kerns**: Thank you.

[00:20:38] **Matthew Kerns**: Currently, when I click the Update Field Label button, it pulls the text that I type.

[00:20:51] **Matthew Kerns**: I want the conversation to end with an updated… you.

[00:20:59] **Matthew Kerns**: Thank

[00:21:06] **Matthew Kerns**: I text only output, and then when I click the update field button, after the conversation response appears, the field text is updated and the brand coach assistant window is closed.

[00:21:50] **Matthew Kerns**: With the latest response text.

[00:21:57] **Matthew Kerns**: This is what I want.

[00:21:59] **Matthew Kerns**: you what I to show

[00:22:04] **Matthew Kerns**: Now we have this chat widget, but it can't update the fields.

[00:22:19] **Matthew Kerns**: What does that say?

[00:22:21] **Matthew Kerns**: Conversational and helpful when the user is for the final answer.

[00:22:24] **Matthew Kerns**: Enter your response with the exact text to use on a new line after.

[00:22:28] **Matthew Kerns**: Final text.

[00:22:28] **Matthew Kerns**: This text will be applied directly to the field.

[00:22:30] **Matthew Kerns**: Keep response concise.

[00:22:34] **Matthew Kerns**: Okay, and then it matches on that final text, so it will update only with the suggested text theory.

[00:22:42] **Matthew Kerns**: Okay, so that's good.

[00:22:53] **Matthew Kerns**: Okay, the new flow is chat with the AI about your field, a response with explanation plus final text.

[00:22:58] **Matthew Kerns**: Okay.

[00:23:00] **Matthew Kerns**: If the text appears in the highlighted box, a prominent update button appears at the bottom, click it, field updates, and mode of closes.

[00:23:07] **Matthew Kerns**: You can still send more messages to refine if needed.

[00:23:09] **Matthew Kerns**: The placeholder changes to ask for changes to refinements.

[00:23:11] **Matthew Kerns**: I'd like to suggest a I think it sounds good.

[00:23:19] **Matthew Kerns**: So let's do generate.

[00:23:22] **Matthew Kerns**: Wait, I want to clear it.

[00:23:24] **Matthew Kerns**: So this, that's not a good.

[00:23:26] **Matthew Kerns**: Generate.

[00:23:29] **Matthew Kerns**: Send.

[00:23:56] **Matthew Kerns**: Send.

[00:23:58] **Matthew Kerns**: Send.

[00:24:02] **Matthew Kerns**: Do just a text, okay.

[00:24:05] **Matthew Kerns**: Update our name.

[00:24:06] **Matthew Kerns**: Boom.

[00:24:06] **Matthew Kerns**: That's what I wanted.

[00:24:08] **Matthew Kerns**: All right.

[00:24:08] **Matthew Kerns**: Okay.

[00:24:09] **Matthew Kerns**: Now let's get clear.

[00:24:14] **Matthew Kerns**: Current value is this.

[00:24:16] **Matthew Kerns**: Let's improve it.

[00:24:19] **Matthew Kerns**: Make it more compelling.

[00:24:20] **Matthew Kerns**: Respected strategists, right?

[00:24:24] **Matthew Kerns**: Approved.

[00:24:25] **Matthew Kerns**: Working.

[00:24:26] **Matthew Kerns**: I like this.

[00:24:27] **Matthew Kerns**: I'm liking this.

[00:24:33] **Matthew Kerns**: Let's make your avatar name more compelling, but tapping into the aspirations you described.

[00:24:38] **Matthew Kerns**: ideal comes from intelligent, respected, and passionate.

[00:24:41] **Matthew Kerns**: Suggested text, the sage of strategy.

[00:24:43] **Matthew Kerns**: blends wisdom, expertise, and a sense of mastery.

[00:24:47] **Matthew Kerns**: Boom.

[00:24:47] **Matthew Kerns**: Update our name.

[00:24:48] **Matthew Kerns**: Cool.

[00:24:48] **Matthew Kerns**: Dawn.

[00:24:51] **Matthew Kerns**: Okay.

[00:24:52] **Matthew Kerns**: Lifestyle description.

[00:24:54] **Matthew Kerns**: See, now that.

[00:24:57] **Matthew Kerns**: Okay.

[00:24:59] **Matthew Kerns**: Absolutely.

[00:25:11] **Matthew Kerns**: The experience for updating one field is now good.

[00:25:17] **Matthew Kerns**: However, there's a bit of an issue once I've worked on one field and I go to work on the next field.

[00:25:25] **Matthew Kerns**: The history from the last field is visible on the new field.

[00:25:30] **Matthew Kerns**: I want it to be cleared or only the conversation from the field I'm working on is visible.

[00:25:54] **Matthew Kerns**: But I don't want it to overtake the screen.

[00:25:56] **Matthew Kerns**: want there to be like a sidebar that shows the Yeah.

[00:26:00] **Matthew Kerns**: Conversations about this field only.

[00:26:02] **Matthew Kerns**: And then I'm able to chat.

[00:26:05] **Matthew Kerns**: I start off with a new chat, and I'm able to click through previous conversations in that widget.

[00:26:35] **Matthew Kerns**: Thank you.

[00:27:06] **Matthew Kerns**: Thank you.

[00:27:46] **Matthew Kerns**: Now, one thing I don't like when I this, it's that's...

[00:27:52] **Matthew Kerns**: Thank you.

[00:27:58] **Matthew Kerns**: Thank you.

[00:27:59] **Matthew Kerns**: Thank

[00:28:06] **Matthew Kerns**: I can't chat with this conversation on the page.

[00:28:32] **Matthew Kerns**: Okay, so let's go back to Avatar.

[00:28:36] **Matthew Kerns**: This is where this is.

[00:28:39] **Matthew Kerns**: So now, cool, it's got that.

[00:28:42] **Matthew Kerns**: Okay, Customer Life.

[00:28:51] **Matthew Kerns**: Okay.

[00:28:52] **Matthew Kerns**: Okay.

[00:28:54] **Matthew Kerns**: Okay.

[00:28:57] **Matthew Kerns**: Okay.

[00:28:58] **Matthew Kerns**: Okay.

[00:28:59] **Matthew Kerns**: Okay.

[00:28:59] **Matthew Kerns**: Okay.

[00:28:59] **Matthew Kerns**: Okay.

[00:29:16] **Matthew Kerns**: Okay, that's good.

[00:29:24] **Matthew Kerns**: Okay, Okay, so this one is sidebar.

[00:29:57] **Matthew Kerns**: Okay.

[00:29:58] **Matthew Kerns**: Okay.

[00:30:04] **Matthew Kerns**: Thank you.

[00:30:49] **Matthew Kerns**: Okay, well that's working, want, basically I want all of these to have the same thing.

[00:30:56] **Matthew Kerns**: It seems like they're building it from brand new, but we need to have it.

[00:30:59] **Matthew Kerns**: Thank you.

[00:31:00] **Matthew Kerns**: Reuse the same stuff.

[00:31:33] **Matthew Kerns**: Thank you.

[00:32:00] **Matthew Kerns**: Thank you.

[00:32:51] **Matthew Kerns**: Okay, so now let's try the conversation at this page.

[00:32:57] **Matthew Kerns**: Thanks.

[00:33:00] **Matthew Kerns**: Let's see, so this is all field chats, it's good, and I can chat with it, okay, stage of strategy is good, okay, let's what it says.

[00:33:40] **Matthew Kerns**: Okay, I'm going to work on this other thing for a bit.

[00:33:54] **Matthew Kerns**: Thank you.

[00:33:57] **Matthew Kerns**: Thank you.

[00:33:59] **Matthew Kerns**: Thank you.

[00:33:59] **Matthew Kerns**: Thank

[00:35:08] **Matthew Kerns**: Let's keep them fully accessible and add a beta preview badge so the expectations are set that it's not fully functional yet.

[00:35:30] **Matthew Kerns**: And then we'll have a video walkthrough.

[00:35:57] **Matthew Kerns**: Thank you.

[00:37:04] **Matthew Kerns**: Thank you.

[00:37:45] **Matthew Kerns**: Cool.

[00:37:47] **Matthew Kerns**: Let's see if that actually worked.

[00:37:50] **Matthew Kerns**: We have our home.

[00:37:57] **Matthew Kerns**: We have...

[00:37:59] **Matthew Kerns**: Let's go.

[00:37:59] **Matthew Kerns**: Let's

[00:39:10] **Matthew Kerns**: Thank you.

[00:39:25] **Matthew Kerns**: Thank you.

[00:39:45] **Matthew Kerns**: Oh, I guess that's what I want.

[00:39:48] **Matthew Kerns**: I kind of wish that button was more over there.

[00:39:52] **Matthew Kerns**: Let's see.

[00:39:52] **Matthew Kerns**: Thank you.

[00:39:58] **Matthew Kerns**: Thank you.

[00:42:59] **Matthew Kerns**: Thank Thank Thank

[00:43:00] **Matthew Kerns**: Awesome.

[00:43:00] **Matthew Kerns**: Okay.

[00:43:00] **Matthew Kerns**: I love this.

[00:43:01] **Matthew Kerns**: I love it.

[00:43:04] **Matthew Kerns**: All right.

[00:43:05] **Matthew Kerns**: Approved.

[00:43:08] **Matthew Kerns**: I'm going to ask what other fields I already did here.

[00:43:17] **Matthew Kerns**: You can just copy and paste, like, wow, that's cool.

[00:43:25] **Matthew Kerns**: So now canvas, you can talk with it.

[00:43:28] **Matthew Kerns**: You can generate, you can talk with this one, but like this one can't really, let's work on my brand voice.

[00:43:53] **Matthew Kerns**: Thank you.

[00:43:54] **Matthew Kerns**: Thank you.

[00:44:02] **Matthew Kerns**: All right, I don't know if these changes.

[00:44:57] **Matthew Kerns**: Okay, so now on the main branch, there's no...

[00:44:59] **Matthew Kerns**: Thank

[00:45:00] **Matthew Kerns**: Field-level chat, because that feature is on the other one.

[00:45:04] **Matthew Kerns**: This info is still there, which is cool.

[00:45:08] **Matthew Kerns**: The chat widget, you can see.

[00:45:19] **Matthew Kerns**: And now we're just adding to the dashboard.

[00:45:26] **Matthew Kerns**: I like the dashboard, paid a preview.

[00:45:54] **Matthew Kerns**: Now, I don't think this conversation is there.

[00:45:58] **Matthew Kerns**: So it's only on...

[00:46:00] **Matthew Kerns**: Fuel level.

[00:46:10] **Matthew Kerns**: Okay, that's perfect.

[00:46:17] **Matthew Kerns**: Okay, let's go back to this.

[00:46:36] **Matthew Kerns**: Thank you.

[00:47:00] **Matthew Kerns**: Thank you.

[00:47:32] **Trevor Bradford**: Hey Trevor.

[00:47:34] **Trevor Bradford**: Hello Matt.

[00:47:35] **Trevor Bradford**: Good to see you.

[00:47:36] **Trevor Bradford**: Good to see you too.

[00:47:39] **Trevor Bradford**: Have you been busy?

[00:47:41] **Trevor Bradford**: So busy.

[00:47:42] **Matthew Kerns**: Yeah.

[00:47:43] **Matthew Kerns**: Sorry it took a while to work on this, but I think I made some good progress so far now.

[00:47:50] **Matthew Kerns**: Yeah, I've just had to like, I've just had to prioritize some other work that's like, like paying the bank account.

[00:47:59] **Matthew Kerns**: Yeah.

[00:47:59] **Matthew Kerns**: Yeah.

[00:48:00] **Matthew Kerns**: So sorry about that, but yeah, you know how it goes.

[00:48:09] **Matthew Kerns**: But so I think we can go over some of this stuff.

[00:48:12] **Matthew Kerns**: I was kind of thinking, like, maybe let's go over this first and then we can talk more about that.

[00:48:19] **Matthew Kerns**: But I had an idea just now, and so we can go over the stuff that we talked about first, and then it'll just lead into the idea that I worked on.

[00:48:39] **Matthew Kerns**: So how does that sound?

[00:48:41] **Matthew Kerns**: Sounds great.

[00:48:42] **Trevor Bradford**: Let's do it.

[00:48:43] **Trevor Bradford**: All right, cool.

[00:48:44] **Matthew Kerns**: So, yeah, I was having trouble logging in, too.

[00:48:48] **Matthew Kerns**: It's fixed now, though.

[00:48:49] **Matthew Kerns**: Basically, what happened was the Supabase project got, like, paused, I guess, because of whatever tier that...

[00:49:00] **Matthew Kerns**: We're on it.

[00:49:01] **Matthew Kerns**: They wanted to conserve resources.

[00:49:03] **Matthew Kerns**: So they just paused it, but they backed up everything.

[00:49:06] **Matthew Kerns**: So we didn't lose any information.

[00:49:10] **Matthew Kerns**: As far as I can tell, it had all my history, at least in my account.

[00:49:14] **Matthew Kerns**: And so I just resumed it and it came back online within like 10 minutes.

[00:49:19] **Matthew Kerns**: So that was good.

[00:49:25] **Matthew Kerns**: So there's a few different things that we talked about last time.

[00:49:31] **Matthew Kerns**: There's the interactive insight page where we wanted to update the whole like get auto suggestions.

[00:49:45] **Matthew Kerns**: So there's this, there were these like get AI help.

[00:49:49] **Matthew Kerns**: And then get suggestions or something down here.

[00:49:53] **Matthew Kerns**: Now it's get AI guidance.

[00:49:56] **Matthew Kerns**: So that button is not perfect.

[00:49:58] **Matthew Kerns**: I need to adjust the color, but.

[00:50:00] **Matthew Kerns**: This one now has better formatting.

[00:50:02] **Matthew Kerns**: So there's this like prompt for the user, which I think is decent.

[00:50:09] **Matthew Kerns**: You can go through and test it later, but at least the formatting looks better.

[00:50:14] **Matthew Kerns**: This one, there's basically no button down here that says get autosuggestion, which we can decide what we want to do there.

[00:50:27] **Matthew Kerns**: But as soon as you start typing, it shows up.

[00:50:31] **Matthew Kerns**: So then I think it's good because it prompts the user to kind of like think about it and start doing something themselves first.

[00:50:40] **Matthew Kerns**: And then as soon as they start typing, it's just here so you can do this.

[00:50:45] **Matthew Kerns**: And then, but so right here, I'm kind of like waiting for a second, which is, I mean, it didn't take that long.

[00:50:53] **Matthew Kerns**: That's kind of okay.

[00:50:55] **Matthew Kerns**: Then there's this answer that comes up that I think is.

[00:51:00] **Matthew Kerns**: Pretty decent.

[00:51:01] **Matthew Kerns**: So for my brand, TCG enthusiasts are driven by a deep passion for trading card games.

[00:51:06] **Matthew Kerns**: So, okay, what's the buyer intent, right?

[00:51:09] **Matthew Kerns**: So seeking not only to expand their collections, but also to enhance their gameplay experiences.

[00:51:14] **Matthew Kerns**: The demographic commonly faces the challenge of sourcing rare cards or finding reliable vendors to offer competitive pricing and authenticity.

[00:51:24] **Matthew Kerns**: So there's like a whole bunch of, there's a couple of paragraphs here, right?

[00:51:30] **Matthew Kerns**: The situations that trigger TCG enthusiasts need to, now I don't necessarily want to evaluate the quality right here, unless you think we can, because I have several things to go over, but we can also, you can do that offline and let me know feedback.

[00:51:47] **Trevor Bradford**: What I think I would do with that, Matt, is get a suggestion from the app here, and I put the same prompt into my...

[00:52:00] **Trevor Bradford**: Hey, GPT, the one that has learned so much about the way that I work and my frameworks and the way that I approach things, it's delivering some really good stuff now because it's, you know, it's had 18 months of working with me.

[00:52:15] **Trevor Bradford**: This is not, this is not my custom GPT because that's very much structured to deliver responses within the idea framework very strictly.

[00:52:24] **Trevor Bradford**: Whereas my mainstream GPT, my main one, it's just learned through experience and it's giving me great stuff.

[00:52:35] **Trevor Bradford**: I would compare one response to the other and then we can decide, you know, is that more or less the same?

[00:52:44] **Trevor Bradford**: Is it, are they both good?

[00:52:46] **Trevor Bradford**: Is the one that's delivered from the app up to standard?

[00:52:50] **Trevor Bradford**: If it is great, it's a tick.

[00:52:54] **Trevor Bradford**: Yeah.

[00:52:55] **Trevor Bradford**: So this touches on my question from, I think, one of our previous meetings, which.

[00:53:00] **Trevor Bradford**: Which we never really bottomed out, and that was which AI is this drawing from through the API, you know, where is it getting its answers from?

[00:53:11] **Matthew Kerns**: Yeah, so it's using, there's some prompts within the app that direct some of these things, like the app level stuff, like, okay, there's a prompt that's saying, Hey, like, for this field, we're generating the buyer intent behind the scenes, right?

[00:53:35] **Matthew Kerns**: So when you click, get auto suggestion, it'll say, okay, we're focused on the buyer intent, then when it goes off, to ask the AI, right now, it's, it's, there's a system knowledge base that has, it has your PDF in it.

[00:53:56] **Matthew Kerns**: So when we go to

[00:54:00] **Matthew Kerns**: I believe I can see it.

[00:54:04] **Matthew Kerns**: If I log in, I should have access to your organization.

[00:54:11] **Matthew Kerns**: And then it's basically a system knowledge base in the back end.

[00:54:15] **Matthew Kerns**: So let's see what it is.

[00:54:18] **Matthew Kerns**: I think it was this one.

[00:54:25] **Matthew Kerns**: Systems, storage, vector store.

[00:54:31] **Matthew Kerns**: So this is the system knowledge base, and it has your book PDF in here.

[00:54:41] **Matthew Kerns**: And see, there is a usage cost associated.

[00:54:45] **Matthew Kerns**: Now, it says last active December 21st, which is over a month ago.

[00:54:52] **Matthew Kerns**: I don't know if that is the last time that this vector base was up.

[00:55:07] **Matthew Kerns**: So, yeah, maybe I need to go in and make sure it's all hooked up.

[00:55:13] **Matthew Kerns**: I thought it was using it, but this is saying that it's not been used for a bit.

[00:55:20] **Trevor Bradford**: I mean, it looks like it's had quite a bit of usage in the past, though.

[00:55:25] **Trevor Bradford**: 277 megabit hours.

[00:55:29] **Trevor Bradford**: That looks like a lot, but I don't know.

[00:55:31] **Trevor Bradford**: Is it a lot?

[00:55:38] **Matthew Kerns**: It might not be that much.

[00:55:42] **Matthew Kerns**: I'm not really sure.

[00:55:43] **Matthew Kerns**: It's not like a crazy amount, like multiple gigabytes.

[00:55:48] **Matthew Kerns**: So one thing, though, with that we just looked at is it's the we're not using the assistance API.

[00:55:57] **Matthew Kerns**: So where it says where it has assistant and used.

[00:56:00] **Matthew Kerns**: We're not using that.

[00:56:01] **Matthew Kerns**: So I want to check and see.

[00:56:06] **Matthew Kerns**: I think I can check it really quick by just that thing.

[00:56:17] **Matthew Kerns**: Can you see my screen, by the way?

[00:56:20] **Matthew Kerns**: Yeah.

[00:56:21] **Trevor Bradford**: Okay.

[00:56:25] **Matthew Kerns**: I'm going to say, do we use the system knowledge base in OpenAI in the back end with our chat completion request?

[00:56:48] **Matthew Kerns**: Okay.

[00:56:50] **Matthew Kerns**: So yeah, we'll find out.

[00:56:54] **Matthew Kerns**: See if this is used.

[00:56:56] **Matthew Kerns**: Pretty sure that it is.

[00:57:00] **Matthew Kerns**: Let's see.

[00:57:02] **Matthew Kerns**: Are any of our calls to AI not using this VectorStore?

[00:57:30] **Matthew Kerns**: Okay, so no, system knowledge base is not currently using chat requests.

[00:57:35] **Matthew Kerns**: The main chat function receives context from three sources, user knowledge base, semantic context, user upload documents, and users open AI VectorStore.

[00:57:50] **Matthew Kerns**: So the per user VectorStore.

[00:57:56] **Matthew Kerns**: Okay, so we didn't wire up the system knowledge.

[00:58:00] **Matthew Kerns**: So I didn't wire up the system knowledge base one yet, that does ring a bell.

[00:58:04] **Matthew Kerns**: I think I've put the stuff in there, but I guess I never wired up the system knowledge base yet.

[00:58:10] **Matthew Kerns**: So once I do that, it should improve things.

[00:58:13] **Trevor Bradford**: Yeah, this is my thinking, that once at least if it's got the book, then it's got a framework and a context.

[00:58:22] **Trevor Bradford**: And of course, in due course, I can upload more documents into this that will enhance its knowledge biopsychology more broadly in the way that my custom GPT has, and that should help it significantly deliver better outputs, would be my guess.

[00:58:46] **Trevor Bradford**: Yeah, thanks.

[00:58:47] **Trevor Bradford**: Yeah, so I mean, what one action point from this map would be to send me a link so that I can just upload the PDFs, additional PDFs to the knowledge.

[00:59:01] **Trevor Bradford**: Let's see.

[00:59:02] **Matthew Kerns**: Uploaded.

[00:59:03] **Matthew Kerns**: How can I just upload here?

[00:59:08] **Matthew Kerns**: Add files.

[00:59:13] **Matthew Kerns**: Okay.

[00:59:14] **Matthew Kerns**: So let's see.

[00:59:14] **Matthew Kerns**: I'm just going to send you this link and let's see if, okay, my WhatsApp just closed on itself.

[00:59:23] **Matthew Kerns**: Yeah, I tried to send you a message like an hour ago saying, hey, jump on this Google Meet anytime.

[00:59:28] **Matthew Kerns**: I'll be working on this stuff.

[00:59:29] **Trevor Bradford**: Yeah, I got it, Matt.

[00:59:30] **Trevor Bradford**: I was just on a call elsewhere though.

[00:59:34] **Trevor Bradford**: I didn't get to see it until I responded to you.

[00:59:38] **Trevor Bradford**: Okay.

[00:59:39] **Matthew Kerns**: So wait, did you see the longer message that I sent or did you see just the one where I said the Meet link?

[00:59:49] **Trevor Bradford**: I've got, I've got the, where's the Meet link?

[00:59:53] **Trevor Bradford**: Let's have a look.

[00:59:56] **Trevor Bradford**: Yes, I've got the Meet link.

[00:59:58] **Trevor Bradford**: And after the Meet link.

[00:59:59] **Trevor Bradford**: .

[01:00:00] **Trevor Bradford**: I said, are you free now?

[01:00:02] **Trevor Bradford**: And you said, hey, yeah.

[01:00:04] **Matthew Kerns**: And I was curious because my WhatsApp doesn't include the history of that earlier.

[01:00:15] **Matthew Kerns**: Yeah, see, storage is too full.

[01:00:16] **Matthew Kerns**: I need to clear some storage on my computer, it looks like.

[01:00:19] **Matthew Kerns**: I'll open that link, and let me see.

[01:00:21] **Trevor Bradford**: So it's required.

[01:00:24] **Trevor Bradford**: So do I just log in with my own OpenAI credential?

[01:00:28] **Trevor Bradford**: Yeah.

[01:00:42] **Trevor Bradford**: Check my inbox, OK.

[01:00:55] **Matthew Kerns**: OK.

[01:00:56] **Matthew Kerns**: OK.

[01:00:56] **Matthew Kerns**: OK.

[01:00:57] **Matthew Kerns**: OK.

[01:00:57] **Matthew Kerns**: OK.

[01:00:58] **Matthew Kerns**: OK.

[01:00:58] **Matthew Kerns**: look.

[01:00:58] **Matthew Kerns**: OK.

[01:00:59] **Matthew Kerns**: OK.

[01:00:59] **Matthew Kerns**: OK.

[01:00:59] **Matthew Kerns**: OK.

[01:00:59] **Matthew Kerns**: OK.

[01:00:59] **Matthew Kerns**: OK.

[01:01:08] **Trevor Bradford**: No nothing yet, no I don't have a link, maybe it's in the junk, I'll check the junk.

[01:01:31] **Trevor Bradford**: Although it shouldn't be in the junk because I use OpenAI a lot, but you never know.

[01:01:41] **Matthew Kerns**: No, it doesn't appear to be in there.

[01:01:44] **Trevor Bradford**: It could just take some time.

[01:01:50] **Matthew Kerns**: If it doesn't come through, you can always send, just upload to that Google Drive and let me know if you want me to add files there.

[01:02:00] **Matthew Kerns**: And then I can do it, worst case scenario, but obviously it'd be better if you can just directly do it.

[01:02:07] **Matthew Kerns**: So hooking up the system knowledge base, I might need to spend like 15 minutes on it, just because I need to, it looks like I'm going to need to update each function, just some copy and paste.

[01:02:21] **Matthew Kerns**: So it's not a big deal, but I'm going do it right now.

[01:02:24] **Trevor Bradford**: Okay.

[01:02:31] **Matthew Kerns**: So maybe, yeah, for now, let's go back into my updates from the last time, and then we can come back to the system knowledge base.

[01:02:41] **Trevor Bradford**: Yeah, okay.

[01:02:43] **Matthew Kerns**: Okay, so this one before didn't have this accept reject, now reject works, and then accept works as well.

[01:02:53] **Matthew Kerns**: There used to be this self expand functionality, where

[01:03:00] **Matthew Kerns**: You could expand that and collapse yourself, but I, so now I just hit accept and I had it, I updated it.

[01:03:10] **Matthew Kerns**: So it automatically resizes, uh, you can let me know if that's annoying or if you want to bring that, it's, it's fine.

[01:03:20] **Trevor Bradford**: I think for the moment, so long as we, I think in a way it's better because the user doesn't have to scroll down to see all of the.

[01:03:30] **Trevor Bradford**: content that's being generated, it all sizes automatically.

[01:03:33] **Trevor Bradford**: So I think that's pretty good.

[01:03:35] **Trevor Bradford**: Yeah.

[01:03:36] **Matthew Kerns**: Okay, cool.

[01:03:37] **Matthew Kerns**: And then, uh, so let's see what else there was, there were like three things that I had, let's see, where was this one?

[01:03:53] **Matthew Kerns**: It was interactive insight page.

[01:03:55] **Matthew Kerns**: There was.

[01:03:57] **Matthew Kerns**: was, was, there there was, was, there was, there

[01:04:00] **Matthew Kerns**: Journey page.

[01:04:02] **Matthew Kerns**: It was the dashboard.

[01:04:04] **Matthew Kerns**: Oh, the beta beta testing.

[01:04:06] **Matthew Kerns**: Right.

[01:04:07] **Matthew Kerns**: So the insight page is mostly just these AI suggestions.

[01:04:13] **Matthew Kerns**: Then there's the beta test page.

[01:04:17] **Matthew Kerns**: So this one, that's interesting.

[01:04:24] **Matthew Kerns**: I might need to check something there because I thought I was already signed up.

[01:04:28] **Matthew Kerns**: So register for beta testing.

[01:04:31] **Matthew Kerns**: You're now registered.

[01:04:32] **Matthew Kerns**: Choose your testing path.

[01:04:34] **Matthew Kerns**: Now I use a different email than the one I'm logged into.

[01:04:37] **Matthew Kerns**: So maybe that's part of the problem, but start quick test.

[01:04:41] **Matthew Kerns**: I can do when I do go to page, it directly goes there.

[01:04:45] **Matthew Kerns**: So it doesn't leave that open.

[01:04:47] **Matthew Kerns**: So that might be something to change because we want to kind of leave this page open for them.

[01:04:54] **Matthew Kerns**: Right.

[01:04:58] **Matthew Kerns**: So, but

[01:05:00] **Matthew Kerns**: But you might notice this.

[01:05:02] **Matthew Kerns**: So there's the beta feedback right here.

[01:05:05] **Matthew Kerns**: So if they click beta feedback, they can type in their stuff right here.

[01:05:10] **Matthew Kerns**: So I didn't know what to do on this page.

[01:05:15] **Matthew Kerns**: Save the comment, it says comment saved.

[01:05:19] **Matthew Kerns**: Then if they click on this, they can see this comment.

[01:05:22] **Matthew Kerns**: They can go back to the journey and they can see their comment right here.

[01:05:28] **Matthew Kerns**: And then they can mark complete from here.

[01:05:33] **Matthew Kerns**: And then the progress looks like it's updated.

[01:05:36] **Matthew Kerns**: And then they can also, I don't think there's a way to unmark it complete, but you can, once it says complete, you can still add comments.

[01:05:47] **Matthew Kerns**: So I tried contacting the email and didn't get a reply and then save comment.

[01:05:56] **Matthew Kerns**: So it keeps track of all their comments, it stores that and the data.

[01:06:00] **Matthew Kerns**: If you refresh the page, it's still there.

[01:06:06] **Matthew Kerns**: When you go back to here, you can see all of your comments per page.

[01:06:11] **Matthew Kerns**: So I think that's a good way to collect feedback.

[01:06:14] **Matthew Kerns**: Yep.

[01:06:18] **Trevor Bradford**: And that is showing to the actual tester, isn't it, Matt?

[01:06:22] **Trevor Bradford**: So when we review this after the test, will there be a spreadsheet output with all the comments?

[01:06:31] **Trevor Bradford**: I mean, how do you and I access the feedback?

[01:06:35] **Trevor Bradford**: Yeah, so it goes to a database.

[01:06:38] **Matthew Kerns**: So in here, there should be a table with beta feedback.

[01:06:45] **Matthew Kerns**: So in this table, we'll be able to see the feedback.

[01:06:57] **Matthew Kerns**: Right.

[01:06:58] **Trevor Bradford**: Is this an open AI or what?

[01:07:00] **Trevor Bradford**: What platform are we on on this screen, Matt?

[01:07:02] **Matthew Kerns**: This is Superbase.

[01:07:04] **Matthew Kerns**: Superbase, okay.

[01:07:06] **Trevor Bradford**: Yeah.

[01:07:10] **Matthew Kerns**: Now, beta testers, okay.

[01:07:16] **Matthew Kerns**: So there's a bunch of beta testers who have signed up, right?

[01:07:19] **Matthew Kerns**: The beta feedback, I don't see it actually updated.

[01:07:24] **Matthew Kerns**: So that's something that I'm taking as an action item.

[01:07:27] **Matthew Kerns**: Yeah.

[01:07:28] **Trevor Bradford**: Where did 100 beta testers come from?

[01:07:31] **Trevor Bradford**: haven't shared it with anyone yet.

[01:07:41] **Matthew Kerns**: I don't know.

[01:07:46] **Matthew Kerns**: Anthony at Titan Network.

[01:07:53] **Matthew Kerns**: Maybe Anna, I know she's from Titan.

[01:07:56] **Matthew Kerns**: Yeah.

[01:07:57] **Trevor Bradford**: Maybe people got the.

[01:07:59] **Matthew Kerns**: I know.

[01:08:00] **Matthew Kerns**: I don't know, maybe word's getting around.

[01:08:02] **Trevor Bradford**: Well, I've discussed it on various work parties and probably people have Googled it and found, let's do that, let's ask.

[01:08:16] **Matthew Kerns**: Yeah, like Google, I mean, it looks like it shows up on Google right here.

[01:08:25] **Trevor Bradford**: Yeah.

[01:08:26] **Matthew Kerns**: And then this beta testing, join the beta program, pretty easy.

[01:08:30] **Matthew Kerns**: That's probably how people did it.

[01:08:31] **Trevor Bradford**: Yeah, it's live.

[01:08:34] **Matthew Kerns**: Cool.

[01:08:36] **Matthew Kerns**: Oh, wow.

[01:08:43] **Trevor Bradford**: Okay, well, it's live.

[01:08:47] **Trevor Bradford**: So did these people leave any feedback, Matt, all these hundreds of folks who tried it?

[01:08:54] **Matthew Kerns**: So let's try this, because the one that's live is different.

[01:09:00] **Matthew Kerns**: So these ones, I don't think the feedback is getting recorded because I don't see any feedback recorded in the beta feedback table here.

[01:09:30] **Matthew Kerns**: So I'm going to check, at least we have their emails, but I don't think there's feedback is getting recorded.

[01:09:47] **Matthew Kerns**: Feedback from testers, but feedback is not being recorded in the database database.

[01:09:58] **Matthew Kerns**: So, yeah, that was one thing that I...

[01:10:00] **Matthew Kerns**: I saw today, it said it's only stored in the browser in the local storage, which is like the way that things were in the app before I started working on it.

[01:10:11] **Matthew Kerns**: Just everywhere else, it didn't get persisted.

[01:10:14] **Matthew Kerns**: So I'm going to fix that right now.

[01:10:22] **Matthew Kerns**: Yeah, so once that's fixed, then add step comments to beta feedback.

[01:10:33] **Matthew Kerns**: I think I already did that.

[01:10:53] **Matthew Kerns**: When do beta comments get actually saved?

[01:11:03] **Matthew Kerns**: I want it to happen as soon as I hit save comment.

[01:11:11] **Matthew Kerns**: Okay.

[01:11:15] **Matthew Kerns**: So, yeah, it looks like people's stuff, well, I mean, so now you can communicate to people once we've verified that the new feedback storage works that, hey, like, now you can add your feedback and it'll get saved.

[01:11:41] **Trevor Bradford**: Okay, and the one that's live, the one that's published, doesn't have the page with the video on it, so that it must be an older version.

[01:11:52] **Trevor Bradford**: Yeah.

[01:11:53] **Trevor Bradford**: It can't be the current one that you're working on.

[01:11:55] **Trevor Bradford**: Yeah, it's definitely an older version there.

[01:11:58] **Matthew Kerns**: Yeah.

[01:11:59] **Trevor Bradford**: So how...

[01:12:00] **Trevor Bradford**: How would I take that down, Matt?

[01:12:01] **Trevor Bradford**: Would I go into Lovable and unpublish?

[01:12:04] **Trevor Bradford**: Would that be the way to do it?

[01:12:06] **Matthew Kerns**: So do you want it to be the newest version to get published or do you want just like nothing to show up?

[01:12:16] **Trevor Bradford**: Let's have nothing to show up until you and I are satisfied that it's ready.

[01:12:23] **Matthew Kerns**: Okay.

[01:12:24] **Matthew Kerns**: So instead of the currently published one, let's see.

[01:12:38] **Matthew Kerns**: URL subdomain.

[01:12:41] **Matthew Kerns**: Where does it get published?

[01:12:43] **Matthew Kerns**: Unpublished.

[01:12:46] **Matthew Kerns**: Let me hit unpublished real quick.

[01:12:48] **Matthew Kerns**: Let's see what happens.

[01:12:52] **Matthew Kerns**: Published URL will no longer be accessible to anyone.

[01:12:57] **Matthew Kerns**: Yep.

[01:12:58] **Matthew Kerns**: Yep.

[01:13:01] **Matthew Kerns**: The product has been unpublished, this button wasn't updated, but that's fine, I guess.

[01:13:09] **Matthew Kerns**: Oh, it's disabled now.

[01:13:11] **Matthew Kerns**: So now if go here, is it there?

[01:13:13] **Matthew Kerns**: Not there.

[01:13:14] **Matthew Kerns**: Nice.

[01:13:15] **Matthew Kerns**: Okay.

[01:13:16] **Matthew Kerns**: Okay.

[01:13:19] **Trevor Bradford**: Because we don't want two versions floating around, do we?

[01:13:24] **Trevor Bradford**: I mean, a lot of those people on that list, I don't know who they are.

[01:13:28] **Trevor Bradford**: So I'll have a look through them, and it may well be that I just message them individually and say, hey, look, noticed that you jumped on and tried the app.

[01:13:39] **Trevor Bradford**: Unfortunately, that wasn't even ready for beta.

[01:13:41] **Trevor Bradford**: If you want to have a go on the new one, here it is.

[01:13:45] **Trevor Bradford**: Please join the beta test and see what they say, see what they do.

[01:13:51] **Trevor Bradford**: Okay.

[01:13:52] **Matthew Kerns**: Sounds good.

[01:13:53] **Trevor Bradford**: So in order for me to do that, Matt, would you, can you drop the link into the.

[01:13:59] **Trevor Bradford**: This not deep track news.

[01:14:03] **Trevor Bradford**: So I've got a link to get back in to find where the list is of the beta testers, please.

[01:14:11] **Trevor Bradford**: Okay.

[01:14:20] **Matthew Kerns**: Tables, beta testers.

[01:14:24] **Matthew Kerns**: Okay.

[01:14:33] **Matthew Kerns**: It would be this one.

[01:14:40] **Trevor Bradford**: I mean, some of those signups are quite old, they, well?

[01:14:47] **Trevor Bradford**: Yeah.

[01:14:48] **Trevor Bradford**: That's okay.

[01:14:48] **Trevor Bradford**: I'll go through that and just take a look at it and just… Okay.

[01:14:53] **Matthew Kerns**: Yeah.

[01:14:54] **Matthew Kerns**: That sounds good.

[01:14:56] **Matthew Kerns**: And then, did you ever… Can you check your email and just see if you got that?

[01:14:59] **Matthew Kerns**: Okay.

[01:15:00] **Matthew Kerns**: That OpenAI one yet, it might have gone through now.

[01:15:03] **Matthew Kerns**: Yeah, let's have a look.

[01:15:05] **Matthew Kerns**: Okay.

[01:15:07] **Matthew Kerns**: I'm gonna see if I can verify this, the beta tester comment thing works.

[01:15:19] **Trevor Bradford**: No.

[01:15:20] **Trevor Bradford**: Okay.

[01:15:23] **Matthew Kerns**: When you, are you logged into the platform.ai?

[01:15:28] **Trevor Bradford**: A chat GP, OpenAI, yeah, I am, yeah.

[01:15:32] **Matthew Kerns**: Is it, what's the website though?

[01:15:34] **Matthew Kerns**: Is it platform.openai?

[01:15:38] **Matthew Kerns**: I'm sorry, Matt, I don't understand the question.

[01:15:41] **Matthew Kerns**: So there's, if you go, it's a different website for kind of like programmers and the chat GPT.

[01:15:55] **Matthew Kerns**: So I just sent you the link to platform.

[01:16:01] **Matthew Kerns**: Right, okay.

[01:16:03] **Trevor Bradford**: In the tab that I have open at the moment, it's auth.openai.com.

[01:16:09] **Trevor Bradford**: And it's waiting for me to put the code in that we're waiting for.

[01:16:15] **Trevor Bradford**: So I'll do the platform one to see what happens there.

[01:16:20] **Matthew Kerns**: Yeah, okay.

[01:16:21] **Trevor Bradford**: Platform, yeah.

[01:16:23] **Trevor Bradford**: Oh, no, it says login.

[01:16:24] **Trevor Bradford**: Okay, just login.

[01:16:28] **Matthew Kerns**: Continue.

[01:16:30] **Trevor Bradford**: Continue.

[01:16:33] **Trevor Bradford**: No, that wants a code as well.

[01:16:36] **Trevor Bradford**: It says this one to my inbox.

[01:16:41] **Trevor Bradford**: Okay.

[01:16:43] **Matthew Kerns**: Yeah, try that.

[01:16:46] **Matthew Kerns**: Okay.

[01:16:48] **Matthew Kerns**: God bless you.

[01:17:00] **Trevor Bradford**: Hmm.

[01:17:04] **Trevor Bradford**: No.

[01:17:10] **Trevor Bradford**: Check the junk again.

[01:17:14] **Trevor Bradford**: No.

[01:17:17] **Matthew Kerns**: Okay.

[01:17:18] **Matthew Kerns**: Um, and that's the right email address and everything?

[01:17:23] **Trevor Bradford**: Yeah.

[01:17:24] **Trevor Bradford**: It's, um, just don't triple check, but I'm just, I'm sure it is because it had my password when it, when I logged in.

[01:17:34] **Trevor Bradford**: So I'm just trying again.

[01:17:36] **Matthew Kerns**: It might just take some time for the new one you just sent out.

[01:17:40] **Matthew Kerns**: Um, you can keep going over some stuff.

[01:17:44] **Matthew Kerns**: I got like 20 more minutes right now, probably maybe 30.

[01:17:48] **Matthew Kerns**: Yeah.

[01:17:49] **Trevor Bradford**: No, just checking my database for where I keep my logins.

[01:17:53] **Trevor Bradford**: And that is the correct email address, Trevor.Bragford.

[01:17:57] **Trevor Bradford**: Thank you.

[01:18:00] **Trevor Bradford**: Or, sorry, can you repeat what were you saying?

[01:18:03] **Trevor Bradford**: Yeah, I've used the correct email address to log into OpenAI, so it's got the right one, but I haven't had any passwords back.

[01:18:17] **Trevor Bradford**: Okay.

[01:18:33] **Matthew Kerns**: Okay, so there's a comments table and there's an overall feedback table, so I think that's good.

[01:18:45] **Matthew Kerns**: Now, I want to just verify if I hit, if I hit save comment, I want to make sure it stores it.

[01:19:01] **Matthew Kerns**: And then I want to go through one more thing that I was working on that I think will be fun.

[01:19:09] **Matthew Kerns**: There it is.

[01:19:12] **Trevor Bradford**: Nice.

[01:19:13] **Trevor Bradford**: Let's try that one now.

[01:19:15] **Trevor Bradford**: Okay.

[01:19:16] **Trevor Bradford**: So this is on the platform one we want to try or the other one?

[01:19:22] **Trevor Bradford**: Yeah, the platform one.

[01:19:41] **Matthew Kerns**: Nice.

[01:19:42] **Matthew Kerns**: Okay, now these comments are stored in the beta comments table.

[01:19:47] **Matthew Kerns**: Yeah, so it's let me in.

[01:19:50] **Trevor Bradford**: Okay.

[01:19:51] **Trevor Bradford**: I'm on the first page is create a chat prompt.

[01:19:56] **Trevor Bradford**: Right.

[01:19:57] **Matthew Kerns**: Okay.

[01:19:57] **Matthew Kerns**: Can you go to the WhatsApp chat?

[01:19:59] **Matthew Kerns**: Yeah.

[01:19:59] **Matthew Kerns**: And I've

[01:20:00] **Matthew Kerns**: click on the platform link that I sent?

[01:20:02] **Matthew Kerns**: Yeah.

[01:20:05] **Matthew Kerns**: That should take you to the IDEA System Knowledge Base Vector Store.

[01:20:11] **Trevor Bradford**: Yeah, it takes me to the home page overview.

[01:20:15] **Trevor Bradford**: Oh, I'm sorry.

[01:20:17] **Matthew Kerns**: I sent you two platform links.

[01:20:20] **Matthew Kerns**: There's Platform, Supabase, and then there's the longer platform link that has the Vector Stores in the URL.

[01:20:30] **Matthew Kerns**: Yeah.

[01:20:32] **Matthew Kerns**: Are you able to see the Vector Store?

[01:20:35] **Trevor Bradford**: Yeah, I'm on Storage and Vector Stores, yes, that's where I am, yeah.

[01:20:42] **Matthew Kerns**: Okay, does it show you the IDEA System Knowledge Base on the right?

[01:20:47] **Matthew Kerns**: Yeah.

[01:20:48] **Trevor Bradford**: Okay, cool.

[01:20:48] **Matthew Kerns**: And you can see it add files at the bottom?

[01:20:52] **Matthew Kerns**: Got it, yes.

[01:20:54] **Trevor Bradford**: Sweet, okay, cool.

[01:20:55] **Matthew Kerns**: So yeah, that's where you can add files to your Knowledge Base.

[01:20:58] **Matthew Kerns**: Okay.

[01:21:00] **Trevor Bradford**: Cool.

[01:21:02] **Matthew Kerns**: The thing is, it doesn't update.

[01:21:04] **Matthew Kerns**: It doesn't use this knowledge base yet behind the scenes.

[01:21:08] **Matthew Kerns**: So I need to do like, like I said before, I think like, maybe 1520 minutes of stuff to get it hooked up.

[01:21:15] **Matthew Kerns**: But let's just make sure we're on the same page for that.

[01:21:21] **Matthew Kerns**: Like, I'll let you know once that's done.

[01:21:28] **Matthew Kerns**: Okay.

[01:21:31] **Trevor Bradford**: All right.

[01:21:32] **Trevor Bradford**: So I've saved that link.

[01:21:37] **Trevor Bradford**: Okay.

[01:21:38] **Trevor Bradford**: I'll save that tab as I'm logged in, and I'll get some stuff uploaded to that as soon as possible.

[01:21:49] **Trevor Bradford**: Okay.

[01:21:54] **Matthew Kerns**: So I'm just pushing in some of the updates that I just talked about.

[01:21:58] **Matthew Kerns**: So then...

[01:21:59] **Matthew Kerns**: Yeah.

[01:22:08] **Matthew Kerns**: Okay.

[01:22:11] **Matthew Kerns**: What else did I want to go through?

[01:22:13] **Matthew Kerns**: So the beta testing, did the interactive insights, then, okay, now we can go to the stuff that I was working on and I'll send you a copy of this call and you can see the session where I worked on it.

[01:22:27] **Matthew Kerns**: But what I'm thinking, what I was thinking is, basically, we have like, we have these generate with AI buttons that are pretty hands off.

[01:22:42] **Matthew Kerns**: Like, it's like they just kind of do it and then you hit accept or reject, you can't really edit or talk with it or anything.

[01:22:49] **Matthew Kerns**: Then you have your brand coach where you can talk with it, but it's separate from the rest of the app, right?

[01:22:55] **Matthew Kerns**: Okay.

[01:22:57] **Matthew Kerns**: So what I was thinking is what

[01:23:00] **Matthew Kerns**: What if there's like a widget down here?

[01:23:01] **Matthew Kerns**: So I made this widget and on the other branch, it's a little better, but basically you can do like a new chat here and you can say, let's work on my brand vision and then it'll chat with you about it, but like, and you can expand this a little bit.

[01:23:26] **Matthew Kerns**: But then let's say to work on vision.

[01:23:32] **Matthew Kerns**: So to work on the vision, you kind of chat with it over here and then maybe you copy and paste over here.

[01:23:39] **Matthew Kerns**: So it was like, well, that's a little clunky still.

[01:23:44] **Matthew Kerns**: So then what I was thinking is I'm going to pause on that, you know, and then, so let's switch back to this.

[01:24:03] **Matthew Kerns**: Hopefully that's clean because I updated the other one.

[01:24:09] **Matthew Kerns**: So what I was thinking is it would be better if instead of having this chat widget or just the suggestion thing, what if we have like right here a field chat?

[01:24:28] **Matthew Kerns**: So you can chat about this field.

[01:24:31] **Matthew Kerns**: So like you want to work on the brand vision or let's go to avatar.

[01:24:37] **Matthew Kerns**: So I like it.

[01:24:38] **Trevor Bradford**: Pretty good.

[01:24:40] **Matthew Kerns**: So, yeah.

[01:24:41] **Matthew Kerns**: So these ones I worked on, I used this field chat to come up with this avatar name.

[01:24:47] **Matthew Kerns**: So this is how it works.

[01:24:49] **Matthew Kerns**: So you can click on it.

[01:24:52] **Matthew Kerns**: And it has a similar sort of interface as the other one where you can see the history of every time.

[01:25:00] **Matthew Kerns**: We worked on this field, and then you can do a new chat, and you can say, hey, let's try something else.

[01:25:13] **Matthew Kerns**: And then, so at first, it kind of created this big long output, and it was kind of annoying.

[01:25:20] **Matthew Kerns**: But then I worked with it a little bit.

[01:25:24] **Matthew Kerns**: You can see the whole session on this recording if you wanted to.

[01:25:28] **Matthew Kerns**: So, but now it does much shorter output, so it's like, great, let's come up with something fresh and more tailored for your TCG audience.

[01:25:35] **Matthew Kerns**: Since your customers aspire to be recognized, intelligent, and passionate players, we want a name that feels expert and driven by community respect.

[01:25:42] **Matthew Kerns**: How about the Mastermind Duelist or the Card Connoisseur?

[01:25:46] **Matthew Kerns**: If you want more options or want to fine-tune the vibe, competitive, creative, or community-focused, let me know what direction feels right.

[01:25:53] **Matthew Kerns**: So, the Mastermind Duelist is the suggested one, and you can hit this

[01:26:00] **Matthew Kerns**: So here, so update avatar name, and then it'll exit that, and it'll tell you the avatar name has been updated, and then this field is updated.

[01:26:11] **Matthew Kerns**: So I think it's, I like this a lot more than even a widget down here because it's just right there, and you can, you know, you can interact with your past chats, so you can be like, okay, well, I don't really like this lifestyle description.

[01:26:31] **Matthew Kerns**: Let's, so now I've updated the avatar name, let's use that to generate a new lifestyle description here.

[01:26:44] **Matthew Kerns**: And then I'm go off and do it, but I just, I'm thinking like this flow might be a good way for people to like fill out the fields, just work on things one at a time, and not have to jump between screens.

[01:27:01] **Trevor Bradford**: Yeah, no, I think that's great.

[01:27:03] **Trevor Bradford**: Anytime you don't have to jump from the screen, copy and paste and come back, it's got to be a better experience.

[01:27:09] **Trevor Bradford**: So that's really good, Yeah.

[01:27:12] **Trevor Bradford**: Yeah.

[01:27:14] **Matthew Kerns**: So now it's incorporated that.

[01:27:16] **Matthew Kerns**: I didn't say, I just said, let's, I've updated the avatar name.

[01:27:19] **Matthew Kerns**: Although, see, it did carry over the chat context from the last one, which is not supposed to do.

[01:27:28] **Matthew Kerns**: So that's kind of something I need to fix.

[01:27:29] **Matthew Kerns**: Right there.

[01:27:31] **Matthew Kerns**: What it did was just for the AI note taker, what it did was I was working on the avatar name field chat and I asked it to let's try something else.

[01:27:44] **Matthew Kerns**: came up with a new name and then I jumped over to the lifestyle description and started chatting and it kept the context from the other field in the same chat.

[01:27:58] **Matthew Kerns**: I'll think about it a little, maybe it's.

[01:28:00] **Matthew Kerns**: It's fine, but I wanted it to be like just a fresh chat here.

[01:28:07] **Matthew Kerns**: So actually, let's try this.

[01:28:10] **Matthew Kerns**: If do a new chat and just say this, so the field isn't updated yet, but I want to see if it will pull from the new avatar name field that's there.

[01:28:29] **Matthew Kerns**: I think that it should, based on the way it's set up, but I could be wrong.

[01:28:37] **Matthew Kerns**: TCG Enthusiast Avatar, see, it didn't pull the latest, so that's something that I can fix up, because it should say something more like Mastermind Duelist.

[01:28:56] **Matthew Kerns**: Okay, yes, I need to clean this up, because something weird is happening with this.

[01:28:59] **Matthew Kerns**: Altyazoo Altyazoo Altyazoo Altyazoo Altyazoo

[01:29:04] **Matthew Kerns**: Because now that other history is not there.

[01:29:13] **Matthew Kerns**: So there might be race condition or something, but yeah, so let's see how this can work.

[01:29:31] **Matthew Kerns**: So when I open it, I want it to know that, so I can, yeah, I'll iterate on that.

[01:29:39] **Matthew Kerns**: But basically you can adjust it.

[01:29:43] **Matthew Kerns**: So our name is mastermind dualist.

[01:29:57] **Matthew Kerns**: And then.

[01:29:59] **Matthew Kerns**: work.

[01:29:59] **Matthew Kerns**: might be such as this.

[01:29:59] **Matthew Kerns**: I

[01:30:00] **Matthew Kerns**: Yeah.

[01:30:01] **Matthew Kerns**: So, I wanted to run that by you before I push it, but it sounds like you're liking this.

[01:30:07] **Matthew Kerns**: Yeah.

[01:30:09] **Trevor Bradford**: No, I think it's great.

[01:30:10] **Trevor Bradford**: I really like it.

[01:30:12] **Trevor Bradford**: What I think, I think I've got to go through the updated app as soon as it's all connected up, as a new user would, and make notes again, and decide where we think we ought to add video.

[01:30:31] **Trevor Bradford**: Tell people what to expect or how to use it.

[01:30:35] **Trevor Bradford**: I mean, making the videos, as I said last time, is not difficult.

[01:30:38] **Trevor Bradford**: I'm all set up to do it.

[01:30:40] **Trevor Bradford**: It was just having the right pages to refer to.

[01:30:44] **Trevor Bradford**: Okay.

[01:30:45] **Trevor Bradford**: So, I think I'm around next week, and then I'm away for a week.

[01:30:52] **Trevor Bradford**: So, it would be great to do everything that I need to do next week, and as soon as possible.

[01:30:59] **Trevor Bradford**: All right.

[01:31:00] **Trevor Bradford**: And ideally, maybe even have it ready to go, but by the end of the week for beta, and then, and then when we know it's working, we can draw a line under this stage of work and decide what has to happen in the next phases.

[01:31:18] **Matthew Kerns**: Okay, cool.

[01:31:20] **Matthew Kerns**: That sounds good.

[01:31:23] **Matthew Kerns**: My, yeah, my calendar is also pretty packed.

[01:31:29] **Matthew Kerns**: I didn't even get a chance to respond to you for a little while there.

[01:31:32] **Matthew Kerns**: I'm sorry about that.

[01:31:34] **Matthew Kerns**: I don't usually want to work that way.

[01:31:36] **Matthew Kerns**: But I've just needed to prioritize the work that pays me hourly.

[01:31:43] **Trevor Bradford**: Understood.

[01:31:44] **Trevor Bradford**: I know this is a shoestring budget, you know, for this phase.

[01:31:48] **Trevor Bradford**: And all, as we've said many times, all we need to know is whether this is a value to users, and if it's commercial or not.

[01:31:57] **Trevor Bradford**: And if it looks like a go as a product.

[01:32:00] **Trevor Bradford**: So then, you know, it's worth spending more money on.

[01:32:04] **Trevor Bradford**: But if everybody said, yeah, it's okay, but, you know, just as well, chat GPT, then it's been an interesting exercise, but it's not commercial.

[01:32:15] **Trevor Bradford**: And I just need to find out and be honest with myself, whether what I've conceived and what we've built together is actually, you know, the sort of thing that people would be prepared to pay for.

[01:32:28] **Trevor Bradford**: Because I think it would be too expensive to just be a free app, you know, to act as a lead magnet.

[01:32:36] **Matthew Kerns**: Yeah, because the AI requests themselves would be costly.

[01:32:40] **Matthew Kerns**: And I still need to go out, go back in and get you that assessment.

[01:32:47] **Matthew Kerns**: I have, I just met someone who actually works on these chat bots for consultants.

[01:32:53] **Matthew Kerns**: So I'm going to have a call with him.

[01:32:57] **Matthew Kerns**: I need to set up a call with the development code.

[01:33:04] **Matthew Kerns**: I wanted to type that right, but I should do it soon.

[01:33:11] **Matthew Kerns**: Now that there's been some updates, I kind of wanted to update the app and then meet up with that guy who does the consultant applications, because I think he will give us some good feedback as well.

[01:33:30] **Matthew Kerns**: But, yeah, I mean, what I was thinking is, like, I might, like, prioritizing this kind of gets difficult for me sometimes.

[01:33:40] **Matthew Kerns**: I've been putting in, like, hours and hours on this project that pays, like, 50 bucks an hour.

[01:33:49] **Matthew Kerns**: So...

[01:33:50] **Trevor Bradford**: I understand, I get it.

[01:33:52] **Matthew Kerns**: I wanted to propose something that might help both of us.

[01:33:57] **Matthew Kerns**: You can let me know whatever you're thinking.

[01:34:00] **Matthew Kerns**: But, like, if you want things to go faster, if you would pay me, like, 50 or, yeah, I think 50 bucks an hour is fine to just spend, like, we could start small just, like, a couple hours here and there and just see how far we can get just to speed things up because that'll prioritize it on my schedule and I would do it, like, right away because my other thing, I get paid, but it takes seven days to get paid from that.

[01:34:31] **Trevor Bradford**: Yeah, I'm happy with it.

[01:34:33] **Trevor Bradford**: I don't want it to be an open-ended thing on that because it could go on and on and on if we don't get it to beta as quickly as possible.

[01:34:42] **Trevor Bradford**: But I think that's fair.

[01:34:44] **Trevor Bradford**: Okay.

[01:34:46] **Matthew Kerns**: Yeah, and we can start, I think I can make a lot of progress with, like, focused sessions and that way I can iterate faster.

[01:34:55] **Matthew Kerns**: So, okay.

[01:34:59] **Trevor Bradford**: Yeah.

[01:35:00] **Trevor Bradford**: mean, let's budget for up to three hours, say, and hopefully you'll have been able to tie the loose ends off and get it to a point where it functions.

[01:35:10] **Trevor Bradford**: And then I want to throw it into beta and just get people using it and feeding back.

[01:35:17] **Trevor Bradford**: Yeah, that sounds good.

[01:35:18] **Trevor Bradford**: We can noodle on forever, couldn't we?

[01:35:21] **Trevor Bradford**: Yeah, we don't want to do that because there's a lot of downsides to doing that.

[01:35:29] **Matthew Kerns**: But I think this is a good balance.

[01:35:31] **Matthew Kerns**: then, yeah, like I don't want to just sit on my computer for three hours and take forever.

[01:35:39] **Matthew Kerns**: So I want to like have a targeted focus session and I want to have things that were like we have objectives.

[01:35:47] **Matthew Kerns**: We have some things from this call that are like follow up items that need to get done for beta, but definitely let me know.

[01:35:54] **Matthew Kerns**: So I'll push the field chat update.

[01:35:58] **Matthew Kerns**: I do want to I'm going to add.

[01:36:00] **Matthew Kerns**: So it's only there on a couple of fields right now.

[01:36:06] **Matthew Kerns**: It's on Avatar, it's on Insight, it's on Canvas.

[01:36:10] **Matthew Kerns**: It's not there for brand copy generator.

[01:36:14] **Trevor Bradford**: Do you know, I thought we were going to drop that one, that page at one point.

[01:36:18] **Trevor Bradford**: Which page?

[01:36:20] **Matthew Kerns**: Copy generator.

[01:36:23] **Trevor Bradford**: Oh, were we?

[01:36:24] **Matthew Kerns**: Did you want to?

[01:36:28] **Trevor Bradford**: Well, I think last time I tested it, it was giving me fairly indifferent results.

[01:36:34] **Trevor Bradford**: And I think we said that if you were really hard pressed on time, that we could hide this page for beta.

[01:36:46] **Trevor Bradford**: Just be focused on the purely the brand strategy parts.

[01:36:51] **Trevor Bradford**: Because I think with copy generation, there are so many people around now offering apps and custom GPTs.

[01:36:59] **Trevor Bradford**: we have call a lot question language,

[01:37:00] **Trevor Bradford**: I'm not just doing general listing copy, that whilst this is a great add-on, unless it's doing something that is pretty special compared to what you can just get out of ChatGPT, then for the moment, I think we should just hide the page.

[01:37:17] **Trevor Bradford**: Okay.

[01:37:19] **Trevor Bradford**: Unless it's working really, really well, in your opinion.

[01:37:24] **Matthew Kerns**: So I want to add it as an action item.

[01:37:28] **Matthew Kerns**: We can decide if we do go or no-go on this page right before we do beta launch, but we still have to hook up the system knowledge base.

[01:37:37] **Matthew Kerns**: So once that's done, and if you can iterate on like a new brand with some of the updates that we've made, and have the system knowledge base hooked up, it's possible that this copy generation could be better than what you were seeing before.

[01:37:56] **Matthew Kerns**: And maybe that'll...

[01:37:59] **Matthew Kerns**: that'll...

[01:37:59] **Matthew Kerns**: that'll...

[01:38:00] **Matthew Kerns**: Push it over into the Go side of things, but...

[01:38:03] **Trevor Bradford**: Well, yeah, I could start fresh with a new project inside the app, something it hasn't worked on before.

[01:38:11] **Trevor Bradford**: So it gives me fresh inputs when I ask it questions.

[01:38:15] **Trevor Bradford**: And in fact, I've got a project I'm working on at the moment, which would be fine as a test.

[01:38:22] **Matthew Kerns**: Yeah.

[01:38:23] **Matthew Kerns**: Do you want to wait until I've updated...

[01:38:26] **Matthew Kerns**: I might be able to just, right after this call, hook up the system knowledge base pretty quickly.

[01:38:32] **Trevor Bradford**: Yeah, then over the weekend, I'll throw some extra documents into it.

[01:38:38] **Matthew Kerns**: Yeah, okay, that sounds good.

[01:38:41] **Matthew Kerns**: And then you can test it with the new user, and then you want to do the video creation side of things, right?

[01:38:51] **Trevor Bradford**: Yeah, I'll just look, I'll go through it again, and just see if I feel that a talking heads video...

[01:38:59] **Trevor Bradford**: I'll

[01:39:00] **Trevor Bradford**: Any of the pages is necessary.

[01:39:02] **Trevor Bradford**: It might be just to give people two minutes.

[01:39:06] **Trevor Bradford**: Okay, this is the page.

[01:39:07] **Trevor Bradford**: This is how you navigate it.

[01:39:11] **Trevor Bradford**: Enjoy, kind of thing, rather than a deep tutorial or something like that, but just a little bit of guidance on how to navigate your page on each of the pages would probably be useful, particularly when we're talking about mousing over the little speech bubbles that you're going to add.

[01:39:30] **Trevor Bradford**: and what their function is.

[01:39:31] **Trevor Bradford**: I think that's probably quite important.

[01:39:34] **Trevor Bradford**: So how to navigate, how to use each page, a little pop-up video.

[01:39:40] **Trevor Bradford**: And that I could do that really quickly.

[01:39:42] **Trevor Bradford**: Once I've familiarized myself with the new flow and how the new functions work, it's very easy.

[01:39:51] **Trevor Bradford**: Yeah.

[01:39:53] **Matthew Kerns**: Um, okay.

[01:39:55] **Matthew Kerns**: I think, yeah, well, okay.

[01:39:58] **Matthew Kerns**: One alternative idea.

[01:40:00] **Matthew Kerns**: Any of the pages is necessary.

[01:40:02] **Matthew Kerns**: It might be just to give people two minutes.

[01:40:06] **Matthew Kerns**: Okay, this is the page.

[01:40:07] **Matthew Kerns**: This is how you navigate it.

[01:40:11] **Matthew Kerns**: Enjoy, kind of thing, rather than a deep tutorial or something like that, but just a little bit of guidance on how to navigate your page on each of the pages would probably be useful, particularly when we're talking about mousing over the little speech bubbles that you're going to add.

[01:40:30] **Matthew Kerns**: and what their function is.

[01:40:31] **Matthew Kerns**: I think that's probably quite important.

[01:40:34] **Matthew Kerns**: So how to navigate, how to use each page, a little pop-up video.

[01:40:40] **Matthew Kerns**: And that I could do that really quickly.

[01:40:42] **Matthew Kerns**: Once I've familiarized myself with the new flow and how the new functions work, it's very easy.

[01:40:51] **Matthew Kerns**: Yeah.

[01:40:53] **Matthew Kerns**: Um, okay.

[01:40:55] **Matthew Kerns**: I think, yeah, well, okay.

[01:40:58] **Matthew Kerns**: One alternative idea.

[01:41:01] **Matthew Kerns**: And by the way, like, we can, this call, like, let's just chat, like, we'll do the hourly thing after, but there's this idea that, have you seen, like, on some apps where it's like a walkthrough, like, when you first open the app, the app kind of has, like, a walkthrough thing where it guides you through, and it's like, hey, start here, step one through of seven, and it'll kind of highlight, like, the start here one, and be like, click here to start, and then it'll give you some info about it, and then it'll walk you through the next step, and the next step, you know what I'm talking about?

[01:41:43] **Matthew Kerns**: Yeah.

[01:41:46] **Matthew Kerns**: So, there's the idea to do that.

[01:41:53] **Matthew Kerns**: I want to check, because I, I had some ideas, and I don't, I don't know if you remember that.

[01:41:59] **Matthew Kerns**: but...

[01:41:59] **Matthew Kerns**: ...

[01:42:00] **Matthew Kerns**: This auto-clawed thing that I sent out for, but basically I want to see if we can test it out.

[01:42:13] **Matthew Kerns**: So interactive onboarding tour.

[01:42:17] **Matthew Kerns**: Remind me, Matt, what was auto-clawed?

[01:42:27] **Matthew Kerns**: Okay, sorry, I just wanted to push the field updates.

[01:42:32] **Matthew Kerns**: So now that will be unlovable.

[01:42:35] **Matthew Kerns**: And just let me know if there's any issues or anything.

[01:42:40] **Matthew Kerns**: So auto-clawed is this really cool new tool that I have that allows me to...

[01:42:48] **Matthew Kerns**: So I pay, you know how lovable there's like this credits?

[01:42:52] **Matthew Kerns**: So I pay for this other tool that's called Claude Code CLI.

[01:42:57] **Matthew Kerns**: And what it...

[01:43:00] **Matthew Kerns**: What does is it charges per month, and then you get a certain amount of credits like every five hours.

[01:43:07] **Matthew Kerns**: So they're like AI credits that cost money per hour, or like, sorry, that's not the right way to say it.

[01:43:15] **Matthew Kerns**: It like gives you a number of credits for a certain timeframe.

[01:43:18] **Matthew Kerns**: So if I'm on my computer using it, I can use as many credits as I want up to a point for that five hours.

[01:43:26] **Matthew Kerns**: But if I'm asleep, then I'm not using the credits that I have access to for that time slot, right?

[01:43:33] **Matthew Kerns**: So what this does is it goes off and it works on stuff in the background.

[01:43:38] **Matthew Kerns**: So like, it's using my credits when I'm not there, and it's building stuff.

[01:43:44] **Matthew Kerns**: And so I'm just playing around with it right now.

[01:43:48] **Matthew Kerns**: But one of the things that I had it do is I had it look at your code base, your application.

[01:43:56] **Matthew Kerns**: It generated a roadmap of

[01:44:00] **Matthew Kerns**: Potential things that need to get added.

[01:44:02] **Matthew Kerns**: So I had it work on analytics, error monitoring, and alerting, which is things that ideally we would have, but it's like, I just, I don't have time to like implement it until later.

[01:44:17] **Matthew Kerns**: But basically I had it go off and, and one of the ideas that had was this interactive onboarding tour.

[01:44:23] **Matthew Kerns**: So right now it's, it's created them.

[01:44:27] **Matthew Kerns**: It's created this onboarding tour.

[01:44:28] **Matthew Kerns**: It went off, had all these subtasks so that it found the dependency, it installed it, it created the tour description.

[01:44:39] **Matthew Kerns**: It did all this stuff.

[01:44:42] **Matthew Kerns**: And I haven't actually looked at it yet.

[01:44:44] **Matthew Kerns**: So we're going to look at the results for the first time right now.

[01:44:47] **Matthew Kerns**: Wow, exciting.

[01:44:49] **Matthew Kerns**: Yeah.

[01:44:53] **Matthew Kerns**: To a new branch called onboarding, interactive onboarding.

[01:45:01] **Matthew Kerns**: So I might need to work through merge conflicts, because we've changed a lot since that got kicked off, but honestly, Claude will probably work through most of those merge conflicts anyways, and let's just see what does.

[01:45:21] **Matthew Kerns**: It's a work tree.

[01:45:27] **Matthew Kerns**: So, yeah, it, these things also, they're kept separately, so they don't like, they don't get in the way of the current one.

[01:45:36] **Matthew Kerns**: They're not like merged into the lovable thing.

[01:45:39] **Matthew Kerns**: They're like on a separate thing.

[01:45:42] **Trevor Bradford**: So, let's switch over to that branch.

[01:45:47] **Matthew Kerns**: So now, yeah, let's see, there's going to be some issues here.

[01:45:56] **Matthew Kerns**: But I think...

[01:46:00] **Matthew Kerns**: We might be able to work through it fairly quickly.

[01:46:08] **Matthew Kerns**: So yeah, the idea is we can, I want to see what it does.

[01:46:16] **Matthew Kerns**: But if we can, if there's any idea that you want to just, that you have, like, like I've been telling you before, just send me all the ideas because I might be able to just spin it off in the background.

[01:46:28] **Matthew Kerns**: Okay.

[01:46:33] **Matthew Kerns**: So start tour, is that it?

[01:46:39] **Matthew Kerns**: Yeah, that didn't do anything.

[01:46:53] **Matthew Kerns**: I clicked start tour.

[01:46:57] **Matthew Kerns**: Yeah, no, no.

[01:46:59] **Matthew Kerns**: No, No, Thank

[01:47:08] **Matthew Kerns**: I wonder if for a new user it would do that.

[01:47:15] **Matthew Kerns**: Shall I try and log into it?

[01:47:20] **Matthew Kerns**: No, because I haven't, I'm not going to push it to lovable until I know that it's working.

[01:47:27] **Matthew Kerns**: And there might just be some issues it's going to work through right now real quick.

[01:47:39] **Matthew Kerns**: So like with that, it goes up and works on stuff in the background, and it builds a lot, but it's not always connected right away.

[01:47:48] **Matthew Kerns**: So that's where I kind of need to come in and connect the things.

[01:47:56] **Matthew Kerns**: I wanted to do it right now with you so you can see.

[01:47:59] **Matthew Kerns**: Let's You can Let's it.

[01:48:00] **Matthew Kerns**: So how much time it might actually take.

[01:48:07] **Matthew Kerns**: Okay, so it says it should work now.

[01:48:09] **Matthew Kerns**: Let's see what happens.

[01:48:14] **Matthew Kerns**: Yeah.

[01:48:17] **Matthew Kerns**: Now, is it highlighting this?

[01:48:20] **Matthew Kerns**: It might be highlighting this.

[01:48:23] **Matthew Kerns**: I see the profile highlighted.

[01:48:29] **Matthew Kerns**: What is the onboarding tour supposed to do?

[01:48:36] **Matthew Kerns**: Because I'm imagining it could do like this walkthrough from start to finish, but like...

[01:48:42] **Matthew Kerns**: That would be great.

[01:48:43] **Matthew Kerns**: Yeah.

[01:48:45] **Matthew Kerns**: So it's supposed to highlight four key features using data tour attributes, start here assessment, brand diagnostic, the framework, avatar builder, brand coach.

[01:48:57] **Matthew Kerns**: If you're not on...

[01:48:59] **Matthew Kerns**: Right.

[01:48:59] **Matthew Kerns**: ...

[01:48:59] **Matthew Kerns**: Like..

[01:48:59] **Matthew Kerns**: You're

[01:49:00] **Matthew Kerns**: Dashboard, the targets don't exist.

[01:49:04] **Matthew Kerns**: Tour should either navigate to dashboard first.

[01:49:07] **Matthew Kerns**: So maybe if I go to dashboard, it will start.

[01:49:13] **Matthew Kerns**: So if I'm here and I click start, look at that.

[01:49:16] **Matthew Kerns**: Wow.

[01:49:19] **Matthew Kerns**: Okay, so brand foundation complete.

[01:49:22] **Matthew Kerns**: Click to start diagnostic.

[01:49:23] **Trevor Bradford**: Start here.

[01:49:24] **Trevor Bradford**: Our brand diagnostic assesses your current brand strength across key dimensions.

[01:49:27] **Matthew Kerns**: Get actual insights.

[01:49:29] **Trevor Bradford**: To understand where your brand starts today.

[01:49:31] **Trevor Bradford**: If I click next, is it going to do something?

[01:49:34] **Trevor Bradford**: Look at that.

[01:49:36] **Matthew Kerns**: Idea framework.

[01:49:37] **Trevor Bradford**: Master the idea framework.

[01:49:38] **Trevor Bradford**: Identity, differentiation, emotion, and action.

[01:49:41] **Trevor Bradford**: This proven methodology helps you build a brand that truly resonates with your audience.

[01:49:48] **Trevor Bradford**: And it highlights.

[01:49:49] **Trevor Bradford**: Oh, look at that.

[01:49:50] **Trevor Bradford**: It even moves around when you scroll.

[01:49:51] **Trevor Bradford**: That's cool.

[01:49:55] **Matthew Kerns**: Next.

[01:49:56] **Matthew Kerns**: Avatar builder.

[01:49:57] **Matthew Kerns**: Create detailed customer.

[01:50:00] **Matthew Kerns**: Avatars, deeply understand, know their goals, challenges, and what motivates them.

[01:50:05] **Matthew Kerns**: And then 4-4, ask Trevor, brand coach, get personalized AI-powered brand coaching, ask questions, get strategic advice, and receive guidance tailored to your unique brand challenges.

[01:50:16] **Matthew Kerns**: That's amazing.

[01:50:18] **Matthew Kerns**: This is like the second time I've used AutoClawed, by the way.

[01:50:23] **Matthew Kerns**: That is outstanding, Matthew.

[01:50:25] **Matthew Kerns**: Yeah.

[01:50:27] **Matthew Kerns**: Because it feels so integral.

[01:50:30] **Matthew Kerns**: To the app, as opposed to a talking head video.

[01:50:34] **Matthew Kerns**: Right.

[01:50:36] **Matthew Kerns**: It's like a walkthrough.

[01:50:37] **Matthew Kerns**: And yeah, and you can just keep going back to the walkthrough.

[01:50:41] **Matthew Kerns**: And I've seen that kind of thing on a lot of apps, particularly when there's a new version of the app, and it highlights what's changed, and yeah.

[01:50:54] **Matthew Kerns**: Yeah.

[01:50:55] **Matthew Kerns**: So, I think it's good enough where I can.

[01:51:00] **Matthew Kerns**: I can push it to lovable, and then you can go through it again later if you want, and let me know if any updates, but honestly, it's kind of good already.

[01:51:10] **Matthew Kerns**: Yeah.

[01:51:17] **Matthew Kerns**: Okay, so yeah, I mean, any, like, ideas that you have, I can just spin it off, and it won't even take me much time to, like, you saw what I did just there, it was, like, maybe 10 minutes to get it working, merge it in, although there's some, I have to go to the dashboard page to get it to work, which is not ideal, so I guess, like, I think the most efficient way we can do things is if you give me as much detail as possible, because, so right now, right now what I'm doing is I am, okay, don't like merge conflicts, but...

[01:51:59] **Trevor Bradford**: Yeah.

[01:52:00] **Trevor Bradford**: Let's see.

[01:52:03] **Trevor Bradford**: What I'm doing is I am basically ...

[01:52:08] **Trevor Bradford**: I think that should be good.

[01:52:26] **Trevor Bradford**: I want stuff to get deleted, but I think that deletion is something that I remember.

[01:52:34] **Matthew Kerns**: Let me know if anything big got deleted or something, but I don't think so.

[01:52:40] **Matthew Kerns**: Right now, what I'm doing is I'm processing our transcripts and I'm pulling all the context from what we've talked about to make updates.

[01:52:49] **Matthew Kerns**: The more detail that you can give me with your feedback, then the quicker the sessions will go.

[01:52:58] **Matthew Kerns**: Okay.

[01:53:00] **Matthew Kerns**: Yeah, I'll do another run through of the whole thing, particularly with the Claude overlay now and give you feedback.

[01:53:10] **Matthew Kerns**: I'll probably do another mood board, another free form board because that seems that's the easiest way for me to just capture what I'm talking about and just point at things and leave notes rather than do it long form written.

[01:53:23] **Matthew Kerns**: So I'll probably do it that way.

[01:53:25] **Matthew Kerns**: But that was impressive, Matt.

[01:53:30] **Matthew Kerns**: Yeah, I'm really excited to use that more.

[01:53:33] **Matthew Kerns**: So like, definitely let me know if you have ideas because I can just literally spin it off to run on the side of my other work and it can work on stuff in the background and then I just merge in the idea and work through a little bit, but it won't, it accelerates the time to delivery by quite a bit.

[01:53:54] **Matthew Kerns**: Like from ideation to whatever change lives.

[01:54:00] **Matthew Kerns**: So I really think that if you have whatever ideas you have, like, oh, this page needs to be completely redesigned or, like, whatever it is, if you just, like, record a video of yourself talking through it, I don't even have to listen to the whole video.

[01:54:21] **Matthew Kerns**: I can just pull the transcript and get your full description of walking through it, and then I can throw it in a, basically, like, a descriptive document or, like, thing that I feed to Autocloud, and it can go build it in the background, and then I just focus on merging it in.

[01:54:42] **Matthew Kerns**: So I think that's going to be one of the most efficient ways we can make use of the time.

[01:54:50] **Matthew Kerns**: So, like, what I want to do is, you want to, we've talked about the three hours, maybe I'll just do, like...

[01:55:02] **Trevor Bradford**: So I'll process this meeting transcript, and I'll send over, like, kind of, like, action items for each of us last time.

[01:55:17] **Trevor Bradford**: then, like, let's get aligned on the action items from both of us.

[01:55:25] **Trevor Bradford**: And then once we're aligned there, then any work that I do after that, I'll start the timer, and I'll just do, like, maybe I'll just, I'll just do, like, 30 minutes at a time and just do an update with that, unless 30 minutes isn't enough to get something meaningful, but I kind of think it will be.

[01:55:49] **Trevor Bradford**: So we can do it that way.

[01:55:51] **Trevor Bradford**: That sounds good.

[01:55:52] **Trevor Bradford**: Yeah.

[01:55:52] **Trevor Bradford**: Okay.
