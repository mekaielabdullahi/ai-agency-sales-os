0:02 - Trevor Bradford
What I want for users to be able to at least get some way towards is a complete strategy output, where there's a document, the brand canvas, that has got all of their updated brand statements on there, has a far more detailed understanding of their avatar, and that at each one of those stages, they've just been able to add it to the canvas. So it's all just there in one document, so that if they then, for whatever reason, need to upload that document either into BrandCoach, or if BrandCoach can't access it directly via the app, if it has to be via an upload, okay, or they want to upload that document to another GPT somewhere else to do something else, it might be about image generation, or it could be... It could Maybe they're briefing their creators on TikTok, for example, and they want to give them a fully in-depth understanding of the brand so that the creator actually makes something that's on-brand as opposed to wandering off and doing their own thing, which easily happens, in my experience, if you don't give them that kind of information. So that's the kind of experience I'd like them to have, Matt, and I think it doesn't have to be complicated, because there are the four steps in the framework, which we've been through together, so you know what they are, and each one is very important and relevant, and they should come together in an output, just by working through the steps.

1:47 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Okay. So the brand canvas output right now, I think, is what I'll focus on. And if I can get that to be something basically usable for the graphic designer, and it'll just follow your framework to do that, so maybe it's just refining the prompt a little bit and improving the visual aspect of the brand canvas output, which one of my business partners has put together a PDF style that I think we could definitely use, that looks nice. So I can pull that in, and we can use that without me having to do too much. And then we can refine the prompt, again, without me having to do too much. So I think I should... I be able to get that to you, like, maybe even today, because, like, I don't want to overpromise, but I'm thinking, like, if I can just take a stab at it and make some progress, where the Brand Canvas PDF can be just a lot better and usable, I have a feeling that what I come to you with, probably won't be the final product, of course, but maybe we can iterate on it fairly quickly, like, just, I'll just produce something that is, like, what I, is from my best understanding right now, and then you can give me some feedback, and then we can iterate on that, so we can just focus on, I can just focus on doing that, and we won't charge you anymore for doing that, and then, but I do think for future of Other things, I can definitely do a lot for another phase, even for 500 or for 1,000, whatever it is.

4:12 - Trevor Bradford
Yeah, I'm happy to do another phase when I've actually got some customer feedback, as we discussed previously, because that's going to be really, really valuable, whereas I don't want to wander around exploring possible features for the app. I'd actually like any further development to be in response to the customer's user experience, and what they think would be most valuable, and we can go, you and I can just look at it and go, that's not a great idea, we probably won't do that, or damn, they've really hit the money on that one, let's develop that further. And that is by far, for me, I think, the best way to spend additional... not... ... ... ... Budget on this. But in order to do that, this thing needs to work. You know, we need to get the basics that were there when we first started to work together to actually work properly in a connected way, which was what I was always looking for, and which I wasn't able to do either myself through Lovable, or with the freelance guy who, as it turned out, didn't have that much of a clue. He didn't have your breadth and depth by any means. So that's why I just need to have something that I can say to people. Hey, look, we're going to break for the holidays. This is working now. Play with it. You know, you've got a bit of time over the festive period. Come back in the new year with your feedback. And then we'll see what that looks like. So be a lot of that time on a boat. So I won't have access to internet. I'll be looking to get a phone signal. So during that period, I won't be able to give you much back in terms of feedback. There are a couple of bits top and tail where we are going to be land based. And so there should be a bit of internet available then. But for the middle chunk of those, the seven days in the middle of those 10, 11 days, I'm going to be largely out of touch. So if there's anything you need back from me in order for you to continue to do what you need to do, we've got between now and then. And whatever, I will make the time and find the time to actually go through it all again. And if necessary, do another float and say, okay, I've followed it through again. This is now working. This is great. Or actually that bit there. That's still broken or still doesn't make sense. So we've got a few days, but not that many.

7:07 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Okay. Yeah. I mean, I'm happy to get it where in a usable state, I think what I need from you is just like things change over time, but I think the main thing I want to stay focused on is what is actually something usable. Because I can see how the brand canvas output needs to be more of a high quality output to be considered usable. Then I think small changes here and there we can we can fix up. The brand separation one is something I can see taking a lot of testing and confirmation. DEMMAX DEMMAX and But I can try making changes on a feature branch and just testing it out and seeing if it is simpler than I am imagining. And then I can let you know if maybe after just a short amount of time, if I'm able to get something working or it looks promising, then potentially that can be part of it. But I guess I think I need to take another look at the Freeform board that because I again, like I said before, I've been focused on other client work that some of it is like high paying.

8:43 - Trevor Bradford
So I just needed to prioritize that so I can essentially pay. I understand we've all got to make a living, mate. So that's a given. But in order for me to do anything with this, it's actually got to work at least to a minimum level. Level. time. Now, I don't mind if that Canvas output is just a text document, so we avoid any of the worries about fiddling with formats and logos or whatever, so long as it captures the various stages of the process and puts them all in one place. You know, for a beta, I'm all right with that. It doesn't have to look super fancy. It doesn't just have to be there.

9:30 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Maybe we could quickly iterate on it right now. So what does, I'm going to just export as Markdown, because I thought I did some level of like, I know the Markdown one is more just text format that has a lot of the information. Okay, so it's trying to pull. Okay, It's trying to pull Insight, like the IDEA stuff, it's trying to pull that from the module in the app, but those modules aren't fully functional yet. So I think that's part of the issue. And then it pulls the brand canvas strategy, and it creates a profile based on the inputs that you put. But I think what we can do is sort of, basically, when we're creating this document, we can just, like, try and funnel everything that happened in the conversation with the GPT into the IDEA framework outputs here, because it's trying to just pull from the wrong place right now.

10:55 - Trevor Bradford
So, which, we had this conversation before, and we didn't. Arrive at a conclusion, but which GPT is actually doing the work here? Is it just ChatGPT in general? And where are the knowledge documents or the knowledge sources that make this an IDEA app, as opposed to just a wrapper that sits around ChatGPT? I still don't have a clear view as to how that's working, you know, which GPT it is, and where the training sits for it. Because if it's not accessing any particular training, it's only taking the inputs that we put into the app, then it's not delivering anything of any greater value than an ordinary ChatGPT conversation. So it needs this training base, really.

11:48 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
I wouldn't say that it's, it's not anything different from the ChatGPT conversation, because what it's doing right now is it's… It's using the prompts that you curated to drive the conversation. So it's basically like a custom GPT wrapper, but it doesn't have the knowledge documents hooked up. So it's just, as far as I understand, it's just using the prompts to drive things. So we could enhance the outputs with hooking up the system knowledge base, which I've already designed. It sort of just needs implementation and testing, but that's how it works right now, is it's just using the prompts. And the reason why we didn't go further down that route is because it seems to be producing good outputs.

12:53 - Trevor Bradford
Yeah, on the brand coach though, I'm asking for some stuff. guys have it Yeah? We'll tell I Thank And it didn't produce anything that was that valuable to me. It just gave me, it told me what to do rather than actually did the analysis for me. And let me see if I can find that.

13:13 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Okay.

13:15 - Trevor Bradford
Where is it? See if can find it in one of the previous chats. Yeah, I think this is, share this.
SCREEN SHARING: Trevor started screen sharing - WATCH: https://fathom.video/share/XVaRRQAs8NxCDt55gasZBzvVnMdK1qTE?timestamp=828.588474 I think that's the right window. Yeah, it is. So, so here we have the coach. And although it's lost the question. That was. Go back to previous chats.

14:04 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Shouldn't it pull that back? Sorry, was just typing something. I'm seeing the screen now. Do you mind reiterating?

14:14 - Trevor Bradford
Yeah. So we've got our various chats down the side, like in ChatGPT. If I move from one to the other, they don't seem to do anything other than change the output, but it doesn't tell me what questions I ask or what the business context is. So it's not pulling the prompts.

14:42 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
You can see that if you scroll all the way down, but it's not in a good place. Like if you scroll all the way down, you can see the history and the questions, but it's like you have to read through a bunch of things to see that, right?

15:00 - Trevor Bradford
Yeah, well, that's at the bottom of the detect stack there. Okay. So that would have been the prompt there, I guess.

15:13 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Yeah. We could, I mean, we could move it or, like, we could leave it because the way that it's designed right now is it has the context and the question at the top, but that question that you entered disappears, like, so we could just have it, leave it there, because then you have this follow-up question section. It's another chat window. So that's, like, different from ChatGPT and how those chat apps work.

15:46 - Trevor Bradford
Yeah. Okay. All right. That makes sense.

15:52 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Okay. So should I do that? Should we put it, should we leave the question up at the top?

15:57 - Trevor Bradford
I, I think it would be. It useful for the end user to see what their initial prompt question was. Okay. So, yeah, I guess so.

16:10 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Let's if I can do that quickly.

16:12 - Trevor Bradford
Yeah. In the way that my custom GPT works for the IDEA framework, it's got a lot of training documents in it. Yeah. And I think, although it, if I was to criticize it for anything, I would say that it probably over-references the framework in every answer. And I think I need to do something with the training of it to tell it not necessarily to do that. But what I would, what I really think this GPT needs. At the very least, it needs to access my book so it understands exactly, you know, what the big picture is, you know, for IDEA Framework. And there's some other documents that I have that are particularly relevant, and I'm sure they will enhance the outputs. So how is it structured, Matt? I mean, you say you've got a knowledge base, but you haven't hooked it up. Is it just somewhere that I can upload documents to, do you think, or how does this work?

17:44 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
So there's a design in place. I think that there is some components that I need to build for it to work properly, and I need to test that it works properly.
ACTION ITEM: Set up Drive folder (access for Matthew); upload book + critical docs; share link - WATCH: https://fathom.video/share/XVaRRQAs8NxCDt55gasZBzvVnMdK1qTE?timestamp=1069.9999 Properly, but we could set up essentially a Google Drive folder where you can upload documents as you want, and it can be like the system knowledge base. So we can do that. If that, setting up that piece might take some, it will take some integration work on my part. So if we don't want to do that yet, what we can do is like you can just send me the most critical documents, and then I can see if I can get those into the system knowledge base. And we can start there and see if that improves things.

18:54 - Trevor Bradford
Why don't we start there? I'll send you a digital version of the And anything else that I feel is the most critical, I'll go back through the documents and have a look and see where we are with that. And I'll get those. In fact, if I put them into a Google Drive folder for you and just share the link with you, that's going to be the best thing, isn't it? Yeah. Yeah. Okay, I'll do that. Sorry, carry on.

19:33 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Well, generally, I like to just default to locking down access. So for that Drive folder, if you want, you can just grant me access only. And then, yeah, that's all I want to say.
ACTION ITEM: Review Freeform board; mark items in/out of scope; share summary w/ Trevor - WATCH: https://fathom.video/share/XVaRRQAs8NxCDt55gasZBzvVnMdK1qTE?timestamp=1195.9999

19:52 - Trevor Bradford
Yeah. that's just a shared folder, isn't it? No other special settings on it or anything.

19:59 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Right. Yeah. Yeah. you.

20:00 - Trevor Bradford
Right. No. Okay. Yeah, well, that's easy to do. We can definitely do that. So I think that other than if you just have a, just re-review the board, the free form board, and just make sure that the questions that I've asked or statements that I've made make sense to you, and whether or not they need to be implemented to get to beta, or whether they fall into the next phase of development, you know, we need to either put a tick against them or a cross against them. But what I don't want to do is just leave them sitting there on the board, unresolved either way. So that's what I'd like an action point to be. Before we do anything else, just quickly scroll through the Freeform board, look at the comments that I've made, and say, yeah, understood, got it, yeah, that makes sense, or no, that's extra work that is outside of the scope of what we agreed. And, you know, for our clarity, my scope is really simple, that the bits join up and the document comes out of the back end, and the outputs of that document are of good quality, to make it worthwhile, anybody spending money on this app in the first place, that's what gets me to beat it. And then I can give that to people confident in the knowledge that it will function as it should, if they then come back with improvements or insights or whatever, that that would definitely fall into the next phase of work. So I just need to get this in a functional state that makes sense to anybody using it, that you would follow this step versus the next and so on. And everything comes out, as we discussed on the brand canvas, there we go with this. You've got what I promised you. You've got your strategy, you've got your insights, you've got your avatar.

22:24 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Yeah. Can we, do you have time right now to quickly go over this new output of the brand canvas?

22:31 - Trevor Bradford
Yeah. What would you do?

22:35 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Can you just approve my request to share screen?

22:38 - Trevor Bradford
Yeah.

22:38 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Shall I stop sharing?

22:40 - Trevor Bradford
I think so. Yeah.
SCREEN SHARING: Matthew started screen sharing - WATCH: https://fathom.video/share/XVaRRQAs8NxCDt55gasZBzvVnMdK1qTE?timestamp=1370.861181

22:46 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
So, oh, now I need to click this. That's what I forgot last time. Okay. Can you see my screen now?

22:57 - Trevor Bradford
Yep.

22:59 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Okay. So. I just went in and basically asked it to, instead of pulling from the idea of modules, I asked it to pull from the conversations and the existing context we have access to for the user, and this is what it looks like now. So a brief, well, maybe I'll just let you read it.

23:25 - Trevor Bradford
I can read it out loud too. Yeah, well, I'm happy to read it, Matt. Tell me what I'm looking at. Tell me what my understanding should be from it, because this is all a bit new to me.

23:37 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
So this is the brand canvas output. So what I did is, now when I hit this button, export as markdown, this is like the text output. And something you can do with markdown is make it look nice like this. So let's, we should review it this way.

23:58 - Trevor Bradford
Yeah. Okay. That makes makes makes a lot more sense. feel much more comfortable with that than looking at effectively code.

24:04 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Yeah. Okay. So your brand, brand strategy documentation, we can update that. That's the first thing I noticed. Then you can click here, two different things. So there's an executive summary. See, this stuff is missing some data. So that's not in a fully usable state yet. So I can go back and wire those things up. But I want to get your feedback on this part. So this is the key strategic pillars. And there's nothing there. I think I might just remove this entirely. Brand overview, quick reference. I might just remove this as well. Quick reference. And some of this is just AI thinking that it, you know, just, just offering ideas, I'll say. Yeah. Then, so the idea strategic brand framework, I think is the one that we actually want to focus on. So the following insights have been automatically organized into the idea framework based on your knowledge base entries. I might not want to say knowledge base entries there. That's a little not user facing brand based. So based on your brand canvas avatar profile, I want to make that singular, and AI conversations, I want to say like brand coach conversations, then insight driven foundation, so understanding your market customers and the data that drives decisions, buying behavior intent, considering, that's a bit, I'm not sure exactly. where this is pulling from, but we should definitely try and refine that. Source avatar 2.0. Profile. Now, I want to actually check that because Averture 2.0, where does it say considering? Buying behavior. Oh. Considering options. Okay. I think it should.

26:19 - Trevor Bradford
that, that, that, that, I think I understand what it's done there. The, the, the considering options means that they're shopping around, guess. You know, they're, considering various options that are available to them before making a decision. Uh, so, but it, it seems a bit strange to be sat under buyer behavior intent, doesn't it? It doesn't seem to be a very user friendly, uh, option to select.

26:49 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Yeah. So it has buying behavior intent and then shopping style as two separate. Like, yeah, more user friendly would be like, okay. Okay. You're. Avatar does this and this and this, and like, there is probably some level of separation where you don't want everything to just be in one paragraph, like you want it to be organized, but this is a little overly organized. It's like, buying behavior intent is one thing, and then there's the source here, which we don't necessarily need, and then buying behavior shopping style as researcher. So, insight-driven foundation, that's, let's see, let's look at the other ones for a second to understand this a little better. So, distinctive positioning, what makes your brand unique, and how you stand out from competitors. So, I think think- It might be most productive if we sort of define what it is you're imagining for each of these IDEA sections, like, instead of this, right, because what I can do is I can go back in and grab this transcript, as long as my Fathom notetaker is working. And I can sort of just, or I can, from memory, just prompt my coding agent to help me put together, like, you know, something that we want, but I just need to know the outcome that we want.

28:41 - Trevor Bradford
Yeah, bear with me a moment, Matt. I just need to open up the book, because the avatar in the book is fully explained. And it was uploaded into Lovable as being the basis. Let's The whole thing, the app is a real world version of the framework as conceived in the book, and then whatever Lovable has subsequently done to it, you know, we're looking at it, I guess, behind the scenes here now. So let me find, let me get that book, where's he gone? Book files latest, there we are. I just want to show you the avatar section, because this is what it really is.
SCREEN SHARING: Trevor started screen sharing - WATCH: https://fathom.video/share/XVaRRQAs8NxCDt55gasZBzvVnMdK1qTE?timestamp=1816.782457 Get the right page. Can I share, Matt? Yeah. Okay. This is Avatar 2.0, the framework. It's got five sections. The first is buyer intent. What are they looking for? What do they want? want the product to do? What's motivating them in the search?

30:38 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Hold on. I'm not seeing. Oh, here we go.

30:41 - Trevor Bradford
Okay.

30:42 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
You got it?

30:43 - Trevor Bradford
Yeah. So the buyer intent is this here, as described. So it's the why behind the customer's actions. The purpose that's driving this search queries or clicks. We'll shop with It's not just about what they're looking to buy, but defining the problem that they're trying to solve. That's the intent behind the search. Section two of the framework of the avatar itself is the motivation, the tasks that they want the product to do for them, the job to be done by the product itself and therefore in your context. The job that they would want your card sleeves to perform for them is to keep rare cards in a pristine state. That's the job to be done. The motivation is to preserve the integrity of the treasured object in your case. Next drill down is emotional triggers. Well, why do you want that to happen? Well, it's valuable. It's rare. It's prestigious. You know, all of those things in your context. That's what we want. Let's Thank To capture at that point in the framework, then we've got shopper type, and that relates to the Shopify report, which broke down shoppers into four different types, one through four, one of the value seekers, only interested in price, not brand loyal, we'll go for the cheapest every time. Usually, if we're selling anything like a premium product, they're not our ideal customer because they buy on price only. The second major chunk of shoppers, and they represent about 50%, and slightly less than 50% are the quality seekers, they're brand loyal, they don't always buy the cheapest, in fact, often they don't. Of course, they don't want to overpay, but at the same time, if they find a product they like, particularly if it's a regular purchase, they are liable. And then there are two really thin layers of people that tend to be the very younger shoppers, the connected types, and there's another one. I just slipped my mind on what it is now.

33:19 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
I remember this from your training. That was good.

33:26 - Trevor Bradford
So in the section in the book, I get into a lot of detail on that. And this is Shopify's analysis. I didn't make those shopper types up, but I found that they are useful when looking at your customer avatar to understand what kind of shopper they are, regardless of any of the other layers in that particular framework. Oops. And then once we've got those four layers, then... The rest of it is about demographics, but we're only interested in the relevant demographics if they impact that customer journey and buying decision. So whether or not they've got a dog of whatever breed is utterly irrelevant if I'm not selling something related to that. Whether or not they're a guy in late middle age doesn't matter if what I'm selling him is not impacted by that particular demographic. So it's up to the shopper to define, OK, after all of those other four elements of the avatar, what is left that is relevant that we need to add to it in terms of just demographics, age, sensibility, marital status, educational status, where they live in the country, income levels. All of those are elements of demographics, but not all of them necessarily impact on the purchase decision. So if they don't impact, then we don't want them in there. So it's all about understanding the why behind all of this decision-making process and having a repeatable framework that we can apply to our particular product or marketplace that allows us to sort of take the guesswork out of it as much as we can.

35:18 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Yeah.

35:20 - Trevor Bradford
So that was what I gave Lovable, you know, this whole book. I said, okay, read it. And it went, yeah, okay. I said, do you understand it? He said, yes, I do. Okay.

35:30 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Then I prompted it to build each of these tools. Right.
ACTION ITEM: Hook book PDF into knowledge base; update Canvas prompt to reference book + conversations - WATCH: https://fathom.video/share/XVaRRQAs8NxCDt55gasZBzvVnMdK1qTE?timestamp=2136.9999

35:36 - Trevor Bradford
And for a while it did okay until it didn't. But this is what it was working with. You know, so it's quite a detailed piece of source material. Yeah.

35:47 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
And I think it's going to really help with the outputs of the brand canvas to connect this PDF to the system knowledge base. Because then we can just see Say in the prompt, okay, you know, when you're creating the brand canvas output, make sure you reference the relevant pieces of this book and the conversations and pull that context together and then output the canvas report.

36:23 - Trevor Bradford
I think really, Matt, this is the most important single piece of knowledge-based documentation because it captures everything.

36:36 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Yep. Do you want to send me that one?

36:40 - Trevor Bradford
Yeah, I'll drop it in the folder. Or do you want it just sent straight away via WhatsApp, Matt, if you need it immediately?

36:50 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Yeah, maybe WhatsApp is good for now. And then, because I'm just going to see how I can get it hooked up. As soon as possible, because it's one of the, it's like, like you said, the most important thing.

37:09 - Trevor Bradford
I hope it should go through. It's not too big a file size. Here you go.

37:24 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Okay.

37:30 - Trevor Bradford
Because I think this should mitigate against the, the GPT that's driving the app, going off and finding stuff somewhere else in order to answer the questions, or at least framing the answers inside this idea framework that makes sense to the process that the customer is going through.

37:54 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Right. Okay, so one second, I'm just going to make an update really quick.

38:24 - Trevor Bradford
I mean, I've got the Shopify document as well. But their full report, if that would be useful. I know I've got it somewhere. Book files. But everything really is in my book that I think is particularly relevant.

38:56 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I think let's focus on getting the outputs to use your book guidance and apply it to the customer's inputs and then produce the outputs for just the IDEA section. Is that the output that you want, actually? I just want to make sure, like...
