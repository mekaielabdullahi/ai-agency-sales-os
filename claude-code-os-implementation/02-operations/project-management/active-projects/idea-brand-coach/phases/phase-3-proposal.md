## Trevor's Success Criteria

> "The criteria that says it's ready for beta is that all the inputs end up on the same document."

**Phase 3 = Beta-Ready Launch**

---

## What Trevor Gets

### 1. Single Consolidated Output Document (PRIMARY)
**The #1 thing blocking beta launch**

- All Avatar Builder inputs compiled
- All Brand Canvas data included
- Copy Generator outputs included
- Single "Download Complete Report" button
- Clean, consistent formatting

**Value:** Beta testers get ONE document with everything. No more fragmented outputs.

---

### 2. Professional UI Polish
**Makes the app look production-ready**

- Fix widow typography on headlines
- Remove Diagnostic from post-login nav (less confusion)
- Add support email link (contact@ideabrandconsultancy.com)
- Consistent text-based exports across all pages

**Value:** First impressions matter. Beta testers see a polished product.

---

### 3. Strategic Brand Building Journey Page (Reinstated)
**The IDEA framework explanation Trevor wanted back**

- Explains Insight, Distinctive, Empathy, Authenticity
- Positions as home/landing after login
- Video placeholder ready for Trevor's content

**Value:** Users understand the framework before diving in. Context = better engagement.

---

### 4. Collapsible Video Component (Reusable)
**Foundation for Trevor's training video strategy**

- Collapse/expand functionality
- Transcript view with copy button
- Placed on: Start Here, Avatar Builder, Brand Canvas
- Reusable across future pages

**Value:** Trevor can add training videos without cluttering UI. Users can copy transcripts for AI tools.

---

### 5. OpenAI/ChatGPT Integration Research
**Exploring how to improve output quality**

- Research connecting users' personal ChatGPT accounts
- Report findings back to Trevor
- Inform Phase 4 development direction

**Value:** Answers the question "how do we make outputs better than generic ChatGPT?"
