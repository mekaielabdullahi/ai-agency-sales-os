## Key Insight: Emotional Connection Framework

Emotional connection with the customer of a physical products brand is about **anticipating the needs of that target avatar**, and solving those needs with a collection of physical products.

Marketing for those products is based on the **psychological reasons behind those physical products**.

---

## Example: Card Game Players (Matthew's Brand)

| Need | Product Solution |
|------|------------------|
| Container to store cards and keep collection in one place | Binders, boxes |
| Keep cards pristine when using them | Soft sleeves, sometimes hard sleeves |
| Surface to keep cards safe during gameplay | Playmat |
| Fun way to roll dice | Dice rolling towers |
| Necessity for the game | Dice themselves |

Each of these can have a **branded style that connects emotionally** to the customer.

---

## Website Value Proposition

The website can help brand owners:
1. **Understand the emotional needs** behind their product offerings
2. **Understand the marketing** behind those product offerings
3. **Suggest new products** based on discoveries in researching customers' emotional needs
4. **Enhance marketing materials** based on emotional insights

---

## Target Audience Refined

The website's target audience is the **brand owner** who needs to:

1. **Refine their brand offer** - a range of products that solve their customers' emotional needs
2. **Speak to emotional needs** associated with each product across media formats - copy, imagery, video
3. **Get the marketing materials actually produced**

---

---

## Problem: Upfront Investment Risk for New Products

**Matthew's challenge:**
- Know customers want a range of products
- Don't have cash to invest in all at once
- Too risky without certainty it will work

**But:** The cost to produce marketing materials and collect data is lower than ever with AI tools.

**Desired solution:** A way to produce and test marketing assets that:
1. Get pre-orders to reduce risk
2. Bring in cash
3. Collect real data about where customers will put their money

**If the website can help solve this for brand owners = Grand Slam / "Full Works" offer**

---

## Solution Direction: Limited Edition + Pre-Orders

**Trevor's suggestion:** Limited edition / collectible items, pre-ordered like crowdfunding.

**Matthew's response:** Yes - limited edition items, communicate ahead of time with marketing. The framework can help dial in the details behind the marketing campaigns.

**Trevor:** It's the only way I know to get inventory pre-funded. Create hype in social media groups, etc.

---

## Crowdfunding Strategy (Trevor's GPT Output)

### Strategic Goal
Fund manufacturing while validating demand, building player community, and seeding long-term collectors.

**Recommended platform:** Kickstarter for discovery, social proof, and press reach.

### Product Architecture (Designed for Conversion)

Think in layers, not SKUs:

| Layer | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Core Game** | Base fantasy card game - complete, playable experience |
| **Collector Layer** | Premium card stock, foil treatment, alternate art, limited edition numbering, Kickstarter exclusives |
| **Accessory Layer** | Branded card sleeves, premium card box/deck vault, playmat |

Each layer should feel like natural progression, not forced upsell.

### Audience Segmentation

| Segment | Cares About | Messaging Focus |
|---------|-------------|-----------------|
| **Players** | Gameplay, balance, replayability | Mechanics, fun, fairness, depth |
| **Collectors** | Scarcity, art, finish, exclusivity | Limited runs, numbered items, exclusive artwork |
| **Fantasy Fans** | World-building, immersion | Lore, factions, narrative, characters |

### Pre-Launch Strategy (Critical)

Success is mostly decided before launch:

1. **Email List** - Landing page with lore teaser, aim for 2,000-5,000 engaged emails
2. **Community** - Discord with early member perks (naming rights, lore input, votes)
3. **Playtesting** - Print-and-play demo, Tabletop Simulator version
4. **Influencer Seeding** - Board game YouTubers, TCG streamers, fantasy art creators

### Pledge Tier Design

Keep simple and progressive:
- **Entry** - Digital or print-and-play (low risk, broad funnel)
- **Core Backer** - Base game (best for players)
- **Deluxe Backer** - Base game + premium cards + limited content (RECOMMENDED tier)
- **Collector Backer** - Everything + sleeves + premium box + numbered exclusive
- **Retailer Tier** - 6-12 units, no exclusives

Avoid more than 6 tiers total.

### Key Takeaway

This approach:
- Builds emotional ownership, not just purchases
- Creates a collector ecosystem, not one-off products
- Keeps manufacturing predictable
- Sets up expansions and future campaigns cleanly

## Future App Feature Idea

## TikTok / Video Brand Strategy (Dec 8)

**Idea:** Add TikTok video brand strategy suggestions to the roadmap.

**Features:**
- Video scripts based on your brand

**Matthew:** "I am prioritizing this now for my brand based on this call."

**Trevor:** "Great idea Matt!"

## Affiliate Outreach Templates (Dec 8)

**Idea:** Branded outreach message templates to affiliates to help build your affiliate army.

**Trevor:** "Definitely!"

---

## Creative Refresh Without Making Content (Dec 8)

**Insight from Dan:** You can do creative refresh strategy without making a single piece of content.

**Approach:**
1. Focus on identifying creators that will resonate emotionally with the brand's target customer
2. The affiliates/creators make the creatives
3. Brand owner just sends updated scripts occasionally (or creator handles it)

**Trevor:** "Let's talk about it"
