## Client's Business Model

### Product
**Brand Coach App** - AI-powered brand consultation tool based on Trevor's IDEA Framework

### Target Market
- Titan membership (~700 members, target 50% adoption = 350 users)
- Outside Titan network (estimated 200 users)
- Total target: 550 users

### Monetization Strategy (TBD)
- **Uncertain:** Subscription vs one-time payment
- **Concern:** "Don't want to build a liability where everybody pays once and uses it forever"
- **Need:** Cost analysis to inform pricing (AI compute costs per user)

### Competitive Landscape
- **Titan AI Copilot** - Generic brand AI from Titan
- **Positioning Advantage:** Trevor's IDEA Framework training + custom GPT + book IP = authority
- **Risk:** Titan members might resist paying for external tool

---

## Key Challenges to Address with Coaches

### 1. Value Delivery Mechanism
**Question:** What keeps users coming back after the initial diagnostic?

**Current Flow:**
1. Free diagnostic (lead magnet)
2. Download PDF (email capture)
3. Paywall (upsell to premium)
4. Access to Brand Coach, Canvas, Copy Generator

**Gaps:**
- Diagnostic is one-time use
- What ongoing value does the app provide?
- How do we create habit loops?
- What makes this worth a subscription vs one-time payment?

### 2. Positioning Strategy
**Question:** How do we position against Titan's free AI Copilot?

**Current Positioning:**
- "Not just another GPT wrap" - trained on IDEA Framework
- Trevor's personal brand authority
- 2 years of custom GPT training + uploaded documents

**Questions for Coaches:**
- Is this differentiation strong enough?
- Should we position as complement to Titan AI vs competitor?
- Potential licensing opportunity with Titan leadership?

### 3. User Engagement & Retention
**Question:** What features drive daily/weekly active usage?

**Current Features:**
- Diagnostic (one-time)
- Brand Coach chatbot (on-demand)
- Brand Canvas (strategy tool)
- Copy Generator (content creation)

**Missing:**
- Progress tracking over time
- Onboarding journey
- Training videos (planned)
- Community features
- Accountability mechanisms

### 4. Scalability Concerns
**Question:** Can the architecture support 500+ users?

**Concerns:**
- AI compute costs per conversation
- Hosting costs at scale
- Support burden if users have issues
- Database performance with large user base

**Need from Coaches:**
- What's the right pricing model to cover costs + margin?
- What features justify ongoing subscription?
- How to structure tiered pricing (if applicable)?

## Meeting Transcripts Summary

**Key Points:**
- Phase 1 delivered, Phase 2 scoped

> "What I don't want to do is build myself a liability where everybody pays once and uses it forever."

> "The essential promise that we're making to the user is that this is not just another GPT with a wrap around it. It's actually trained on all of the right documentation."
