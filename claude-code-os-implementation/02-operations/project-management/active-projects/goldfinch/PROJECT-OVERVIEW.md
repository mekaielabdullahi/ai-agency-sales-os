# Goldfinch - Reusable Mobile Component Library

**Platform:** Kotlin/Android (primary), Kotlin Multiplatform (future)
**Type:** Data Annotation Income + Agency Infrastructure
**Status:** Active Development
**Priority:** P0 - Income Floor Until Higher-Paying Work Available

---

## Purpose

Goldfinch is a strategic bridge project. The data annotation platform pays $50/hour for fully-tested, production-ready Android components ("golden solutions"). Instead of building throwaway code, we're building components that:

1. **Pay the bills now** - $50/hour income floor between client projects
2. **Create reusable assets** - Every component is production-ready and generic
3. **Protect intellectual property** - Components are intentionally general to avoid leaking proprietary business logic

---

## The Strategic Play

| Benefit | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Income Floor** | $50/hour work between higher-paying client projects |
| **Production-Ready** | Data annotation requires fully tested "golden solutions" |
| **IP Protection** | Generic components don't expose client-specific logic |
| **Reusability** | Components align with agency solution patterns |
| **Build Ahead** | Ready to deploy when clients need mobile |

**The constraint:** Work on this until we can consistently get paid more than $50/hour on client projects.

## How It Works

The data annotation project (details at `~/workspace/dataAnnotation/goldfinch`) requires:
1. Create a codebase with an intentional bug
2. Write comprehensive tests (F2P that fail, P2P that pass)
3. Implement the fix as a "golden solution"
4. Submit production-ready, fully tested component

**Our approach:** Build components that align with our agency's growing solution base:
- Chat/voice widgets (every client app needs these)
- API connectivity patterns (AWS, REST, WebSocket)
- State management patterns
- Offline-first data persistence
- Background work patterns

---

## Technology Stack

- **Language:** Kotlin
- **Platform:** Android (primary)
- **Architecture:** Modular, generic components
- **Testing:** Comprehensive unit + integration tests

---

## Component Roadmap (Aligned with Agency Solutions)

### Priority 1: Android-to-Backend Connectivity
- Secure API client setup (token management, auth)
- AWS integration patterns (Cognito, S3, API Gateway)
- Real-time communication (WebSocket, SSE)

### Priority 2: State Management Patterns
- ViewModel lifecycle handling
- Compose state management
- Multi-screen shared state

### Priority 3: Data Persistence Patterns
- Room database migrations
- DataStore/Preferences
- Offline-first sync

### Priority 4: Background Work Patterns
- WorkManager chains
- Periodic sync
- Failure handling

## IP Protection Strategy

**What we AVOID submitting:**
- Client-specific business logic
- Proprietary algorithms
- API keys, credentials, endpoint URLs
- Client names or identifying information
- Unique competitive advantages

**What IS SAFE to submit:**
- Generic networking/authentication patterns
- Common UI patterns (lists, forms, navigation)
- Standard integration patterns (AWS, Firebase, etc.)
- Error handling and resilience patterns
- State management patterns

---

## Daily Work Structure

**Rate:** $50/hour
**Work:** Build Android components as "golden solutions"
**Output:** Production-ready, tested, reusable components

This is income floor work while building leverage for the agency.

## Connection to Agency Projects

Components built here can eventually be used in:
- Plotter Mechanix mobile app (if needed)
- AntSavvy contractor apps
- Concrete CEO tools
- Idea Framework mobile interface
- Future client mobile projects

The key: Keep everything generic so it's reusable without modification.
