# Active Projects

## What Makes a Project "Active"?

A project belongs in `active-projects/` **ONLY** if it meets these criteria:

### Primary Criterion: Active Revenue
✅ **You are getting paid or will get paid for work on this project**

This includes:
- **Billable discovery calls** ($200-500/hr diagnostic sessions)
- **Scoped projects with signed agreements** (even if payment is upon delivery)
- **Ongoing delivery work** (building, managing, or supporting)
- **Revenue-sharing partnerships** (active collaboration with payment terms)

❌ **NOT active projects:**
- Cold prospects with no commitment
- Speculative ideas or concepts
- Internal experiments unrelated to client revenue
- Past clients with completed projects (archive these)
- "Maybe someday" opportunities without engagement

---

## The Simple Test

**Ask yourself:**
> "If I stopped working on this today, would it impact revenue in the next 90 days?"

- **YES** → Active project, keep it here
- **NO** → Move to prospects, archive, or delete

---

## Project Lifecycle States

### 1. **Discovery** (Active if Billable)
- Client has committed to paid discovery call
- Scoping/diagnostic work is billable
- **Payment status:** Invoiced or will be invoiced

**Example:** Concrete CEO discovery → Active if Chris bills for diagnostic time

### 2. **Scoped/Proposed** (Active)
- Proposal delivered and under consideration
- Contract negotiations in progress
- High likelihood of close (>50%)
- **Payment status:** Pending agreement

**Example:** Proposed audit package to Concrete CEO → Active if Tyler is seriously considering

### 3. **In Delivery** (Active)
- Contract signed, work in progress
- Actively building, managing, or delivering
- **Payment status:** Invoiced or will be upon delivery

**Example:** S&S Wolf Sheds website rebuild → Active (in delivery phase)

### 4. **Completed - Awaiting Payment** (Active)
- Work delivered, invoice sent
- Waiting for payment collection
- **Payment status:** Invoiced, not yet collected

**Example:** Delivered project, Net 30 payment pending → Active until paid

### 5. **Paid & Closed** (Archive)
- Payment collected
- No ongoing work or support
- **Action:** Move to archive folder

### 6. **Dead/Lost** (Delete or Archive)
- Client went dark
- Project cancelled
- Lost to competitor
- **Action:** Document lessons learned, then archive or delete

---

## Special Cases

### Revenue-Sharing Partnerships
**Active if:** Partnership agreement signed OR pilot engagement funded

**Example:**
- ✅ Concrete CEO with signed agreement → Active
- ❌ Concrete CEO pre-proposal → NOT active (move to prospects)

### Retainer or Support Agreements
**Active if:** Client is paying monthly retainer or has active support contract

### Free Discovery (No-Billable)
**NOT active** unless it leads to paid engagement within 2 weeks

**Rule:** Don't create folder until money is committed

## Current Active Projects

| Project | Client | Type | Status | Value | Priority |
|---------|--------|------|--------|-------|----------|
| [Plotter Mechanix](./plotter-mechanix/) | David | SaaS Development | 🟡 Discovery | $5K-$50K | P0 |
| [S&S Wolf Sheds](./ss-wolf-sheds/) | Sandra | Website + Operations | 🟡 In Progress | $10K | P0 |

**Total Active Revenue Pipeline:** $15K+ committed

## Folder Management Rules

### When to CREATE a folder:
1. **Paid discovery call scheduled** → Create folder, document in meetings/discovery/
2. **Contract signed** → Create folder if not already created
3. **High-confidence proposal delivered** (>70% close probability) → Create folder, mark as "Scoped"

### When to ARCHIVE a folder:
1. **Payment collected and project complete** → Move to `/archived-projects/`
2. **Client relationship ended** → Archive with notes
3. **Project on hold >90 days** → Archive or delete

### When to DELETE a folder:
1. **Prospect went cold** (no response, no commitment)
2. **Lost deal** (no lessons to preserve)
3. **Speculative folder created prematurely** (shouldn't have been here)

---

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

### ❌ Don't Do This:
- Creating folders for every cold prospect
- Keeping "maybe" projects that will never close
- Hoarding old completed projects (archive them)
- Treating discovery as "active" if it's unbillable

### ✅ Do This:
- Create folders only when money is committed
- Archive completed projects within 30 days of payment
- Use a separate `/prospects/` folder for pre-commitment leads
- Keep active-projects lean and revenue-focused

---

## The Revenue Test

Every folder in `active-projects/` should pass this test:

```
Revenue in next 90 days = $X,XXX
```

If the answer is "$0" or "unknown," **it's not an active project.**

---

## Alignment with OBG

**One Big Goal:** $50k/month revenue for 3+ consecutive months

Every project in `active-projects/` must contribute to this goal:
- Direct revenue (billable work)
- Pipeline revenue (scoped and closing soon)
- Partnership revenue (active agreements)

**If it doesn't drive revenue, it doesn't belong here.**

## Quick Reference

**Create Folder When:**
- [ ] Client commits to paid discovery call
- [ ] Contract signed
- [ ] High-probability proposal delivered (>70%)
- [ ] Partnership agreement active

**Archive Folder When:**
- [ ] Payment collected and work complete
- [ ] Project on hold >90 days
- [ ] Client relationship ended

**Delete Folder When:**
- [ ] Prospect went cold (no commitment)
- [ ] Lost deal (no valuable lessons)
- [ ] Premature folder creation

**Remember:** Active = Money committed or imminent. Everything else is noise.
