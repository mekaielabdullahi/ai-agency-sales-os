## Revenue & Lead Split

### Free Events (Tier 1)

| Item | Katrina | AriseGroup |
|------|---------|------------|
| Ticket Revenue | $0 | $0 |
| Email List | Shared (both can nurture) | Shared |
| Audit Conversions | 0% | 100% |
| Coaching Referrals | 100% | 0% |

**Rationale**: Free events are lead gen. Katrina gets exposure to new audience. AriseGroup gets qualified AI leads.

### Paid Events (Tier 2-3)

| Item | Katrina | AriseGroup |
|------|---------|------------|
| Ticket Revenue | 50% | 50% |
| Email List | Shared | Shared |
| Audit Conversions | 0% | 100% |
| Implementation Work | 0% | 100% |
| Coaching Referrals | 100% | 0% |

**Rationale**: 50/50 ticket split is fair for co-hosted paid events. Downstream conversions go to whoever delivers the service.

### Example Math (Tier 2 Event)

- 30 registrations x $67 = $2,010 ticket revenue
- Split: Katrina $1,005, AriseGroup $1,005
- Plus: AriseGroup converts 4 audits -> 2 closes = $10K
- **Katrina total**: $1,005
- **AriseGroup total**: $11,005 (but also did the conversion work)
