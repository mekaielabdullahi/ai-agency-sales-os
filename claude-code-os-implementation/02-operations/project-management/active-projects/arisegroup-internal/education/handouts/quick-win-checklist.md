## Troubleshooting

### "The AI output isn't good enough"
- Be more specific in your prompt
- Give examples of what good looks like
- Break the task into smaller steps

### "It takes too long to review/edit"
- Improve your prompt template
- Lower expectations (good enough > perfect)
- Some tasks need human polish—that's okay

### "I keep forgetting to use it"
- Build it into your workflow
- Set a daily reminder
- Start with just one task type

### "It's not saving as much time as expected"
- Re-evaluate the opportunity
- Maybe it's not a good Quick Win
- Look for higher-impact tasks
