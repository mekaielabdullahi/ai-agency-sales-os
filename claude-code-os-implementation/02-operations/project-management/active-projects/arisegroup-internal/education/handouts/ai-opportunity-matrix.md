## The Matrix

Use this matrix to prioritize your AI opportunities. Plot each opportunity based on two factors:

1. **IMPACT**: How much time/money would this save if implemented perfectly?
2. **EASE**: How easy is it to implement?

```
                         HIGH IMPACT
                              |
                              |
     +-----------------------+|+-----------------------+
     |                       ||                        |
     |     STRATEGIC         ||     QUICK WINS         |
     |     INVESTMENTS       ||     (Start Here!)      |
     |                       ||                        |

     +-----------------------+|+-----------------------+

     |                       ||                        |
     |  Skip these.          ||  Low priority.         |
     |  Low impact + hard    ||  Do if you have        |
     |  = waste of time      ||  extra bandwidth       |
     |                       ||                        |
     +-----------------------+|+-----------------------+
                              |
                              |
                         LOW IMPACT

## Decision Framework

Before implementing any AI opportunity, ask:

1. **What's the weekly time savings?**
   → Minimum 2+ hours to be worth it

2. **How often does this happen?**
   → Daily/weekly tasks have bigger impact

3. **What's the error cost?**
   → High-error tasks benefit most from AI

4. **Can I measure success?**
   → If you can't measure it, you can't improve it

5. **Does it require human judgment?**
   → If yes, AI assists (not replaces)
