### Event Description (Copy)

```markdown
## AI didn't fail you. But something did.

Every week, another "AI will change everything" headline. Another tool promising to 10x your productivity. Another founder on LinkedIn claiming they automated their entire business.

Meanwhile, you tried ChatGPT. You signed up for that automation tool. Maybe you even paid for a course.

And... nothing stuck.

**The problem wasn't AI. The problem was you didn't have systems to apply it to.**

---

### This is NOT another AI hype session.

This is a 90-minute working workshop where you'll learn the exact framework we use to help businesses implement AI successfully—and why most fail before they even start.

**What you'll do:**

- **Learn the Framework**: Understand why 70% of AI projects fail (and how to avoid it)
- **Map Your Business**: Use our 10 Business Functions model to audit your operations
- **Find Your Opportunities**: Identify the 2-3 places where AI will actually make a difference
- **See Real Demos**: Watch specific automations in action
- **Get Your Questions Answered**: Live Q&A throughout + breakout room discussions

---

### This workshop is for you if:

- You run a business with 20-100 employees
- You've tried AI tools but couldn't make them stick
- You're tired of generic advice that doesn't fit your business
- You want a framework, not another tool recommendation

---

### What you'll walk away with:

1. A complete self-audit of your business operations
2. Your top 2-3 AI opportunities (prioritized)
3. A framework you can use forever—not just another tool
4. Optional: A free 30-min AI Readiness Audit for personalized guidance
