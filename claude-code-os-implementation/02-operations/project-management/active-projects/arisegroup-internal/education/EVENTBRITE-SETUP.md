### Event Description (Copy)

```markdown
## You're not the only one struggling with AI.

Every week, another "AI will change everything" headline. Another tool promising to 10x your productivity. Another founder on LinkedIn claiming they automated their entire business.

Meanwhile, you tried ChatGPT. You signed up for that automation tool. Maybe you even paid for a course.

And... nothing stuck.

**You're not alone. And this event is proof.**

---

### This is NOT a workshop. This is a conversation.

We're gathering business owners who are in the same boat—curious about AI, frustrated by the hype, and looking for real answers from people who get it.

**What happens:**

- **Introductions**: Meet other founders facing the same challenges
- **Small group discussions**: Get into breakout rooms with 4-5 peers
- **Hot seat sessions**: Volunteer to share your specific challenge and get live feedback
- **Honest Q&A**: No sales pitch—just real talk about what's working and what's not

---

### This event is for you if:

- You've tried AI tools but couldn't make them stick
- You're tired of generic advice that doesn't fit your business
- You want to meet other business owners dealing with the same struggles
- You learn better from peers than from "experts"

---

### What you'll walk away with:

1. Connections with other founders who actually understand your challenges
2. At least one actionable idea from someone who's faced similar problems
3. Clarity on whether AI is even the right solution for your situation
4. Optional: A free 30-min AI Readiness Audit if you want personalized help

## Frequently Asked Questions

**1. Who is this event for?**
Business owners and operators who have tried AI tools and struggled to make them work. If you've felt frustrated, confused, or left behind by the AI hype—you'll fit right in.

**2. Is this a webinar or presentation?**
No. This is a networking event. You'll spend most of your time in conversation with other business owners, not listening to someone talk at you.

**3. Will there be a recording?**
No. This is live-only. We want people to speak openly, which means no recordings.

**4. Do I need to have my camera on?**
Encouraged but not required. Networking works better when people can see each other, but we won't force it.

**5. Is this a sales pitch?**
No. We host these to connect with business owners and understand what you're actually struggling with. At the end, we mention our free AI Readiness Audit for anyone who wants personalized help—but there's no pressure.

**6. What if I'm not good at networking?**
We structure the conversations so you're not just awkwardly making small talk. You'll be in small groups (4-5 people) discussing specific topics. Much easier than traditional networking.

**7. What should I prepare?**
Think about: What AI tool did you try? What happened? What do you wish worked? That's your conversation starter.

**8. Will I actually meet people I can stay connected with?**
That's the goal. We encourage exchanging LinkedIn connections. Many attendees continue conversations after the event.

**9. What if I can't make the time?**
This is live-only. Sign up for the next one—we're planning to make this recurring.

**10. What's the next step after the event?**
Up to you. Some people just take their new connections and go. Others book a free 30-minute AI Readiness Audit if they want personalized guidance on their specific situation.
