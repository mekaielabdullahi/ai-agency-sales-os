**Slide 4: Why Are We Here? (Katrina)**
```
Entrepreneurs are busy DOING the work.

You're:
- Running the business
- Serving clients
- Managing team
- Fighting fires

When do you optimize?

→ That's why we're here.
```

**Slide 5: The Promise (Katrina)**
```
In the next 90 minutes:

You'll walk away with:
1. A framework to evaluate ANY AI opportunity
2. YOUR top 2-3 automation quick wins
3. A clear next step (no more confusion)

→ Let's get into it.
```

**Slide 6: The Problem (Mekaiel)**
```
70% of AI projects fail.

[Source: McKinsey, 2024]

Not because the technology doesn't work.
```

**Slide 7: The Real Reason**
```
They start with the wrong question.

❌ "What AI tools should I use?"

✅ "What processes am I trying to improve?"
```

**Slide 8: The Shift**
```
Tool-First vs. Process-First

TOOL-FIRST:
"I heard ChatGPT is great"
→ Try it → Doesn't stick → Frustration

PROCESS-FIRST:
"My quoting takes 3 hours"
→ Map the process → Find the friction → Apply AI

→ Which approach do you usually take?
[CHAT PROMPT]

### Section 2: The Framework (Slides 9-16) - 15 minutes

**Slide 9: Section Title**
```
THE 10 BUSINESS FUNCTIONS MODEL

A simple way to map your entire operation
```

**Slide 10: The Wheel**
```
[VISUAL: Circular diagram with 10 segments]

1. Revenue Generation
2. Sales & BD
3. Marketing & Content
4. Client Delivery
5. Customer Service
6. Operations & Admin
7. Finance & Accounting
8. HR & Team
9. IT & Infrastructure
10. Leadership & Strategy

Every business has these functions.
AI impacts some more than others.
```

**Slide 11: Where AI Has Most Impact**
```
HIGHEST IMPACT FUNCTIONS:

1. Operations & Admin
   → 40% time savings potential

2. Customer Service
   → 60% query automation

3. Sales & Marketing
   → 30% efficiency gains

```

**Slide 12: The Key Insight**
```
You don't need AI everywhere.

You need it in the 2-3 places where you're
leaking time and money every day.

→ Let's find those places.
```

**Slide 13: Quick Poll**
```
[POLL]

Which business function causes you the most pain?

○ Sales & lead generation
○ Client delivery
○ Operations & admin
○ Customer service
○ Marketing & content
○ Other

[Results will display]
```

**Slide 14: Common Patterns**
```
What I hear most often:

"We spend too much time on [X] that doesn't need human thinking."

Examples:
- Scheduling back-and-forth
- Data entry / transfer
- Following up manually
- Creating documents from scratch
- Answering the same questions

Sound familiar?
[CHAT: Drop yours]
```

**Slide 15: The Framework in Practice**
```
HOW TO USE THIS:

Step 1: List your 10 functions
Step 2: Rate each: Hours/week + Frustration level
Step 3: Find the overlap (high time + high frustration)
Step 4: Those are your AI candidates

→ We'll do this together now.
```

**Slide 16: Transition**
```
EXERCISE TIME

Let's map YOUR business.
(This is where the magic happens.)
```

### Section 3: Interactive Exercise (Slides 17-22) - 20 minutes

**Slide 17: Exercise Instructions**
```
YOUR SELF-AUDIT

Open the worksheet I dropped in chat.
(Or use pen and paper)

We'll walk through it together.
```

**Slide 18: Step 1**
```
STEP 1: List Your Functions

Don't overthink. Just list what you do:

- How do you get clients?
- How do you deliver?
- How do you handle admin?
- How do you communicate?

Write 5-7 main categories.
[3 minutes]
```

**Slide 19: Step 2**
```
STEP 2: Time + Frustration

For each function, rate:

TIME: How many hours/week?
1 = <1 hr | 2 = 1-5 hrs | 3 = 5-10 hrs | 4 = 10+ hrs

FRUSTRATION: How annoying?
1 = Fine | 2 = Mildly annoying | 3 = Frustrating | 4 = I hate this

[4 minutes]
```

**Slide 20: Step 3**
```
STEP 3: Find Your Targets

Look for HIGH TIME + HIGH FRUSTRATION.

These are your AI candidates.

Circle your top 2-3.

[2 minutes]
```

**Slide 21: Share Out**
```
WHAT DID YOU FIND?

Drop in the chat:

"My top AI target is: ________________"

(No judgment — we all have these!)
```

**Slide 22: Katrina Commentary**
```
[Katrina shares observations]

"Here's what I notice about these patterns..."

- Common themes
- Entrepreneurship perspective
- Encouragement
```

### Section 4: AI Opportunity Matrix (Slides 23-29) - 15 minutes

**Slide 23: Section Title**
```
THE AI OPPORTUNITY MATRIX

Where to focus (and where not to)
```

**Slide 24: The Matrix**
```
[VISUAL: 2x2 matrix]

                    HIGH IMPACT
                        |
    STRATEGIC          |          QUICK WINS
    INVESTMENTS        |          ⭐ START HERE
    (Later)            |
                       |
 ----------------------+----------------------
                       |
    NOT WORTH IT       |          NICE TO HAVE
    (Skip)             |          (Maybe later)
                       |
                       |
                    LOW IMPACT

    HARD <-------------|--------------> EASY
         TO IMPLEMENT
```

**Slide 25: Quick Wins Examples**
```
QUICK WINS (30-90 days)

High impact + Easy to implement:

- Email drafting assistance
- Meeting notes → action items
- Document template generation
- FAQ chatbot
- Calendar scheduling

These don't need custom development.
Often just smart use of existing tools.
```

**Slide 26: Strategic Investments**
```
STRATEGIC INVESTMENTS (3-6 months)

High impact + Harder to implement:

- Full workflow automation
- Custom AI agents
- Integrated systems
- Predictive analytics

Worth it, but do Quick Wins first.
Build the muscle.
```

**Slide 27: Where to Avoid**
```
NOT WORTH IT

Low impact + Hard to implement:

- AI for the sake of AI
- Automating rare edge cases
- Complex solutions for simple problems

Ask: "If this works perfectly, how much time/money does it save?"

If the answer is small → skip it.
```

**Slide 28: Plot Your Opportunities**
```
YOUR TURN

Take your 2-3 targets from the exercise.

Where do they fit on the matrix?

Top-right = Start here
Top-left = Plan for later
Bottom = Probably skip
```

**Slide 29: The Priority**
```
YOUR ACTION PLAN

1. Pick ONE quick win (top-right)
2. Implement in next 30 days
3. Measure the time savings
4. Build on success

→ Let me show you what this looks like.
```

### Section 5: Quick Wins Demo (Slides 30-35) - 10 minutes

**Slide 30: Section Title**
```
REAL QUICK WINS

(Not hypotheticals — these are running right now)
```

**Slide 31: Demo 1 - Email Automation**
```
DEMO: EMAIL CLASSIFICATION & RESPONSE

The Problem:
- 50+ emails/day
- 45 min just reading and sorting
- Another 30 min drafting responses

The Solution:
- AI reads and categorizes incoming email
- Drafts responses for review
- I just approve and send

Result: 45 min → 5 min daily
Annual savings: 166 hours

[LIVE DEMO or VIDEO CLIP]
```

**Slide 32: Demo 1 - How It Works**
```
UNDER THE HOOD

[Simple workflow diagram]

Email arrives
    ↓
AI categorizes (urgent/normal/FYI)
    ↓
AI drafts response
    ↓
I review in 30 seconds
    ↓
Send

Tools: n8n + Claude API
Setup time: 4 hours
```

**Slide 33: Demo 2 - Document Generation**
```
DEMO: DISCOVERY → PROPOSAL

The Problem:
- Discovery call = lots of notes
- Turning notes into proposal = 2-3 hours
- Repetitive structure, unique details

The Solution:
- AI extracts key points from notes
- Generates proposal draft
- I refine and send

Result: 2.5 hours → 15 minutes

[LIVE DEMO or VIDEO CLIP]
```

**Slide 34: Demo 2 - How It Works**
```
UNDER THE HOOD

[Simple workflow diagram]

Paste call notes
    ↓
AI extracts: client, challenges, opportunities
    ↓
AI fills proposal template
    ↓
Output: 80% done draft

Tools: Claude (free tier works)
Setup time: 30 min (write the prompt)
```

**Slide 35: The Point**
```
THESE AREN'T MAGIC

They're simple applications of:
1. A clear process
2. The right AI tool
3. Smart prompting

You can do this.

→ Let's talk about how to get started.
