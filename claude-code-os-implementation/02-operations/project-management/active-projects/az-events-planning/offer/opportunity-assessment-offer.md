## Why $10K?

### The Math
- If their DOC is ~$8,000/day
- Assessment cost = ~1 day of operations
- Identifies opportunities worth 10-100x the investment

### The Value
- Clarity on where money is leaking
- Prioritized action plan (not random guessing)
- Foundation for smart investment decisions
- Avoid building wrong things

### The Alternative
- Keep guessing
- Build wrong things
- Waste money on bad solutions
- Stay stuck in manual processes

## How to Position

### Frame 1: Investment, Not Cost
> "This isn't a cost - it's the foundation for every smart investment you make in the next 12 months."

### Frame 2: Prevent Waste
> "Companies that skip discovery spend 3-5x more fixing mistakes. This prevents that."

### Frame 3: Roadmap to ROI
> "In 6 weeks, you'll know exactly where every dollar should go for maximum return."

---

## The Close Script

> "Based on everything you've shared today, here's what I'd recommend:
>
> We start with a Phase 1 Opportunity Assessment. Over 4-6 weeks, we dig deep into your operations, identify where you're losing money and opportunity, and deliver a complete roadmap.
>
> The investment is $10,000.
>
> What that gets you is clarity - you'll know exactly what to build, in what order, and what the ROI will be. No guessing, no wasted money on the wrong solutions.
>
> Does that make sense as a starting point?"

## Objection Handlers

### "That's expensive"
> "I understand. Let me ask - what's the cost of spending the next 6 months guessing at solutions that might not work? The assessment ensures every dollar after this goes to the right place."

### "We need to think about it"
> "Of course. What specifically would help you make that decision? Is it the scope, the timeline, or the investment level?"

### "Can we just start building something?"
> "We could, but here's the risk - without the assessment, we might build the wrong thing first. Companies that skip discovery spend 3-5x more fixing mistakes. The assessment is insurance against that."

### "Wrong timing"
> "When would be the right time? And what changes between now and then? Usually waiting just means the problems get more expensive."

## What Comes After (Phases 2-4)

### Phase 2: Design
- Solution architecture
- Tool selection
- Integration planning
- Custom development scope

### Phase 3: Deploy
- Build the solutions
- Implement integrations
- Train the team
- Go live

### Phase 4: Drive
- Optimize and measure
- Scale what works
- Continuous improvement
- Ongoing support

## Notes
- Assessment is the gateway - earns right to propose larger work
- Their answers from 5 Questions become the assessment focus
- Assessment findings become the Phase 2-4 proposals
- Never skip Phase 1 - it's where trust is built
