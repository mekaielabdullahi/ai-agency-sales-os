## Field Observations (Your Intel)

### 1. Crew Communication Issues
**Observed:** Team seemed confused during setup - unclear who does what, where
**Questions to Ask:**
- "How do you communicate setup instructions to field crews?"
- "How do you track who is where during events?"
- "When something goes wrong at setup, how does the crew know what to do?"

### 2. Staff Training Gaps - CONFIRMED PAIN POINT
**From Dec 19 call:** Bungee trampoline equipment failed on first day because staff wasn't 100% trained
- Amy confirmed it was "more stressful than it should have been"
- "A couple little forks that were not prepared for"
- Staff not prepared for new machine

**Questions to Ask:**
- "How do you train new crew members?"
- "What happens when a crew member encounters equipment they haven't used before?"
- "After the bungee trampoline situation, have you thought about how to prevent that with new equipment?"

### 3. Emergency/Public Safety Gap
**Observed:** Dark came quickly at event, people seemed lost, no clear info access
**Your Idea:** QR code system at event locations
- Scans to event-specific landing page
- Emergency contacts
- Safety protocols
- Event info & schedule
- Staff locations
- First aid stations
- AZ Inflatable branding (marketing opportunity)

### 4. Capacity Constraint - Owner Bandwidth
**From Dec 19 call:** Amy acknowledged difficulty juggling:
- Media coordination
- Website development
- Event prep
- Day-to-day operations

> "I've got multiple fronts... a lot on my plate"

**Opportunity:** Position as extension of her team to alleviate pressure during recovery
