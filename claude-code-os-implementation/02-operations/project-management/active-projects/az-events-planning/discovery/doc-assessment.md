## Two Question Versions

### Version 1: Direct (For financially savvy clients)
> "What does it cost you to run AZ Inflatable Events every single day - just to keep the doors open?"

### Version 2: Breakdown (For clients who don't track daily costs)
> "Let's break this down together. If you think about what you spend each day on labor, marketing, equipment maintenance, and operations - what would you estimate that total is?"

## When to Use DOC in Meeting

**Option 1:** After Q2 (while talking money)
> "You mentioned [Q2 cost]. Let me ask - do you know what it costs to run this business every single day?"

**Option 2:** After Q5 (zoom out to total impact)
> "Before I show you what this could look like, help me understand the bigger picture. What's your daily operating cost?"

## The Capital Bloodstream Diagnosis

### Step 1: Identify Where They're Bleeding
"Of all those daily costs, where do you feel like money is just... leaking?"

### Step 2: Quantify the Hemorrhage
"If you're losing X per day on [category], that's [X × 365] per year"

### Step 3: Position the Solution
"Our assessment identifies exactly where that bleeding is happening and creates a roadmap to stop it"

## Sample Script for AZ Inflatable

**If they know their numbers:**
> "You run a $3M operation. That's roughly $8,000 a day just to exist. Where do you feel like that $8,000 isn't working as hard as it could?"

**If they don't know:**
> "Let's rough this out. How many crew members on a typical day? What's the average wage? OK so labor alone is about $X per day..."

## Why This Matters for the $10K Assessment

The DOC conversation:
1. Reveals their financial sophistication
2. Establishes pricing anchor (if daily cost is $8K, $10K assessment is ~1 day of operations)
3. Shows you understand business, not just tech
4. Identifies where biggest ROI opportunities are
5. Their numbers become the ROI justification in your proposal
