## Agenda

### 1. Opening (10 min)
**Objective:** Build rapport, set expectations

- Warm greeting, thank them for their time
- Quick personal connection
- Set the frame:
  > "We're excited to learn more about AZ Inflatable Events. Our goal today is to understand your business, your goals, and see if there's a way we can help. Sound good?"
- Confirm time: "We've got about an hour - does that still work?"

### 2. Learn About Them (15 min)
**Objective:** Understand their business, build trust

- "Tell us about AZ Inflatable Events - how did you get started?"
- "What are you most proud of about the business?"
- "What's the vision for the next 12 months?"
- **Key:** Listen, show genuine interest, take notes

### 3. Discovery - The 5 Questions (20 min)
**Objective:** Uncover pain, quantify cost, establish urgency

Work through systematically:
1. "What's the biggest challenge you're facing right now?"
2. "How much do you think that's costing you each month?"
3. "How long have you been dealing with this?"
4. "If nothing changes over the next year, what does that look like?"
5. "If you could wave a magic wand and have the perfect solution, what would it look like?"

**Remember:** Their answers become your proposal

### 4. Your Observations (5 min)
**Objective:** Show you understand their business

Share what you noticed from the event:
- "When I was there capturing footage, I noticed..."
- Crew coordination question
- Emergency/public safety question
- "Is that something you've thought about?"

### 5. Vision & Recap (5 min)
**Objective:** Paint the future, confirm understanding

> "So if I'm hearing you correctly:
> - [Q1 problem] is costing you roughly [Q2 amount] per month
> - You've been dealing with this for [Q3 time]
> - If nothing changes, [Q4 consequence]
> - And the ideal solution would look like [Q5 vision]
>
> Did I get that right?"

### 6. Introduce the Opportunity Assessment (5 min)
**Objective:** Present Phase 1 as the logical next step

> "Based on everything you've shared, here's what I'd recommend:
>
> We start with what we call an Opportunity Assessment - it's Phase 1 of how we work with companies.
>
> Over 4-6 weeks, we do a deep dive into your operations, identify where you're losing money and opportunity, and deliver a complete roadmap.
>
> The investment is $10,000.
>
> What you get is clarity - you'll know exactly what to build, in what order, and what the return will be."

Pause. Let them respond.

### 7. Close & Next Steps (depends on response)

**If interested:**
> "Great. Here's how we start: We'll send over a simple agreement, schedule a kickoff call, and get moving. What questions do you have?"

**If hesitant:**
> "I understand. What would help you feel confident about moving forward?"

**If not ready:**
> "No problem. Let's schedule a follow-up for [date] to continue the conversation. In the meantime, I'll send you some information about how our assessments work."
