## Your Job in This Meeting

### Primary: Technical Discovery
When they describe problems or desired solutions, dig into the technical details. Understand their current systems, workflows, and what's actually possible.

### Secondary: Build Technical Rapport
Show them we understand their operational challenges. You're the one who'll design the technical solution.

---

## When to Jump In

Chris leads the conversation. You support on technical questions:

### Technical Probes (Use When Relevant)
- "What systems are you using for [booking/scheduling/tracking]?"
- "How does information flow from booking to field crews?"
- "When a crew shows up to an event, what info do they have?"
- "How do customers currently contact you during events?"
- "What happens when something breaks down at an event?"

### Operational Deep-Dives
Based on their pain points, explore:

| If They Mention | Ask About |
|-----------------|-----------|
| Crew confusion | "Walk me through a typical setup - how do crews know what goes where?" |
| Training gaps | "How do new team members learn to operate equipment like the bungee trampoline?" |
| Communication issues | "When something goes wrong, how does that info get to the right person?" |
| Booking/scheduling | "What does your booking process look like from inquiry to event day?" |

## Things to Assess (Mental Checklist)

While listening, think about:
- [ ] What's their tech stack? (Booking system, CRM, communication tools)
- [ ] What integrations would be needed?
- [ ] Where are the automation opportunities?
- [ ] What could a Notion workspace solve for them?
- [ ] What workflows could N8N automate?
- [ ] Is this a QR code / digital guide opportunity?

### 1. Crew Communication & Training
- Digital setup guides per equipment type
- Video training library
- QR codes on equipment linking to how-to content

### 2. Event Operations
- Real-time crew tracking/coordination
- Digital checklists for setup/teardown
- Incident reporting system

### 3. Customer-Facing Systems

## Technical Questions for Assessment Scoping

If the conversation allows, understand:
- "Do you have a central system, or is it spreadsheets and paper?"
- "What's the one thing that would make the biggest difference for your crews?"
- "How much of your day is spent on things that feel like they should be automatic?"

---

## After Discovery Phase

When Chris transitions to the close, you can add:
> "Based on what you've described, there's a lot we can do here. The assessment will map out exactly which systems would have the biggest impact and in what order."

This validates the technical opportunity without over-promising specifics.

You're showing them we understand their world. Technical empathy = trust.

Don't solution yet. Understand first.
