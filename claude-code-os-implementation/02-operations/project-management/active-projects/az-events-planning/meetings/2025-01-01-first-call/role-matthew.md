**Date:** January 1, 2025
**Your Role:** Production Engineer & Strategic Architect

## Your Job in This Meeting

### Primary: Ask "Why" - Challenge Assumptions
Listen for problems they mention and probe deeper. Make sure what they're describing is the REAL problem, not a symptom.

### Secondary: Technical Feasibility Assessment
When they describe desired solutions, mentally assess: Is this buildable? What would it actually take?

---

## What to Listen For

### Technical Signals
| They Say | You're Thinking |
|----------|-----------------|
| "We use [tool]" | Integration complexity |
| "Our booking system..." | What system? API available? |
| "We want to automate..." | What exactly? How manual is current process? |
| "Staff don't know..." | Training content? Digital guides? |

### Questions to Ask (Sparingly)

If something doesn't add up or needs clarity:
- "When you say [X], what does that actually look like day-to-day?"
- "What happens when that breaks down?"
- "Is that a people problem or a systems problem?"
- "What tools are you already using for that?"

### DOC Opportunity
If Daily Operating Cost discussion comes up, help quantify:
- "So if you're spending X hours on that at $Y/hour, that's $Z/day..."
- "Over a year, that adds up to..."

---

## Your Mental Checklist

While listening, assess:
- [ ] What's the actual problem? (Not the symptom)
- [ ] Is this buildable with our tools?
- [ ] What integrations would be needed?
- [ ] Is this a $10K problem or a $50K problem?
- [ ] What would Phase 1 (assessment) actually uncover here?

---

## When to Speak Up

✅ **DO speak up if:**
- Something technically doesn't make sense
- They're describing a symptom, not a root cause
- You need clarification on current systems/tools
- You can help quantify the cost with quick math

❌ **DON'T speak up to:**
- Propose solutions (too early)
- Talk about how we'd build it (save for later)
- Correct the lead (Chris/Trent running the conversation)

---

## After the Meeting

Your immediate action items:
1. Sync with Trent on technical complexity/feasibility
2. Draft initial assessment scope thoughts
3. Flag any concerns or red flags for the team

### Assessment Review Checklist
After the call, evaluate:
- [ ] Is this a real opportunity? (Pain + Budget + Urgency)
- [ ] What would the assessment actually need to uncover?
- [ ] Technical complexity estimate (Low/Medium/High)
- [ ] Any red flags for delivery?
- [ ] Rough estimate: Is this a $10K, $25K, or $50K+ project?

**Hand off to:**
- **Mekaiel:** Your observations for PRD context
- **Team:** Go/no-go recommendation

---

## Key Context You Have

From your observations at their event:
- Crew seemed confused during setup
- Dark came quickly, people were lost
- No clear emergency/info access for public

You can reference these if it helps validate their pain points.

---

## Remember

> "If I have clear things that I need to build, there's so many tools that I can build stuff quickly. But I also need to work through all the issues."

This meeting is about getting CLARITY on what to build. Listen more than talk.
