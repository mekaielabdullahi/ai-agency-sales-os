> Over 4-6 weeks, we do a deep dive into your operations, identify where you're losing money and time, and deliver a complete roadmap.
>
> The investment is $10,000.

> What you get is total clarity - you'll know exactly what to build, in what order, and what the ROI will be.
>
> Does that make sense as a starting point?"

Your job is done once meeting ends. Hand off to:
- **Mekaiel:** Gets the notes, starts PRD

Let them talk. Listen. Then show them you understand.
