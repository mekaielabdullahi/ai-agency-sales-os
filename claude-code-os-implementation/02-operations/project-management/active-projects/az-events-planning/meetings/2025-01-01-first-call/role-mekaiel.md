## Your Job in This Meeting

### Primary: Keep Us On Track
You're the timekeeper and process guardian. Make sure we hit all 5 Questions and stay on agenda. If we're drifting, redirect.

### Secondary: Document Requirements
You're building the foundation for the PRD. Everything Amy and her husband say about problems, costs, and desired outcomes goes into your notes.

### Tertiary: Protect the Process
If the conversation drifts toward "can you just build us X" - redirect back to discovery. We need to understand before we propose.

## 5 Questions Checklist - TRACK THIS

Check off as we complete each:

- [ ] **Q1:** What's your biggest problem right now?
- [ ] **Q2:** How much is it costing you per month?
- [ ] **Q3:** How long have you had this problem?
- [ ] **Q4:** If nothing changes in 6-12 months, what happens?

**If we skip one, jump in:**

## Redirect Phrases

If conversation goes off-track:
- "That's great context - can we come back to [current question]?"
- "I want to make sure we capture this - what was the cost impact of that?"
- "Before we go there, help me understand [5 Questions topic]"
- "We're running short on time - let's make sure we cover..."

## What to Listen For & Document

### For the PRD (Write These Down)
| Category | What to Capture |
|----------|-----------------|
| **Pain Points** | Exact problems they mention (training gaps, crew confusion, bandwidth) |
| **Costs** | Any numbers they give - time, money, lost bookings |
| **Current State** | How they do things now (manual, fragmented, etc.) |
| **Desired State** | What "success" looks like to them |
| **Constraints** | Budget hints, timeline pressure, Amy's recovery limits |

### Key Quotes to Capture
- When they quantify pain ("costs us $X" or "takes Y hours")
- When they express frustration (emotional = urgent)
- When they describe their ideal solution (Q5 magic wand)

---

## Questions You Can Ask

If conversation stalls or needs more detail:
- "Can you walk me through what happens when [problem] occurs?"
- "Who's currently responsible for handling that?"
- "What have you tried before to solve this?"
- "If we could fix just ONE thing, what would have the biggest impact?"

## Red Flags to Note

- If they can't quantify costs → may not value the problem enough
- If they want to jump to solutions → slow them down, we need discovery first
- If husband seems disengaged → note for follow-up strategy

1. Clean up notes within 2 hours
2. Draft PRD v0 outline based on what you heard
3. Share notes with team for review
4. Identify what additional info we need before assessment can begin

## Remember

> "Before you change the PRD, it has to come from a business funnel. If you're putting outputs in, they should be coming from inputs from a business funnel."

This meeting IS the business funnel input. Capture everything.
