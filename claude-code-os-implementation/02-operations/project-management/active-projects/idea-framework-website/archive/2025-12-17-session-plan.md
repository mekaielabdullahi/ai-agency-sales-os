## 1-Hour Focus Options

### Option A: End-to-End Testing (Recommended)
**Why:** Finds bugs early, shows what's actually broken vs working

**Quick Test Checklist:**
- [ ] New user flow: Landing → Diagnostic → Auth → Results → Chat
- [ ] Create new brand diagnostic from scratch
- [ ] Test chat sessions (create, rename, delete, switch)
- [ ] Test copy/download buttons
- [ ] Note any bugs or broken flows

**Output:** Bug list with priorities

---

### Option B: Doc Updates + Admin
**Why:** Quick wins, less technical

**Tasks:**
- [ ] Capture Dec 12 clarity call outcomes (from memory)
- [ ] Update PROJECT-OVERVIEW.md with current status
- [ ] Send Fathom recording link to Trevor
- [ ] Draft "Phase 2 complete" message

**Output:** Updated docs, message ready to send
