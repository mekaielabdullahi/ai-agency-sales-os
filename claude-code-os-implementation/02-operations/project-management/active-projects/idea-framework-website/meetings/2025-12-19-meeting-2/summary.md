Meeting Purpose

Define the Brand Canvas output for the beta launch.

Key Takeaways

- Beta Goal: A usable Brand Canvas PDF, generated from user inputs via the IDEA framework, is the sole requirement for the beta launch.
- Critical Fix: The app's GPT is a prompt-wrapper lacking a knowledge base, causing generic outputs. Connecting it to Trevor's book is the top priority.
- Immediate Action: Matthew will integrate Trevor's book PDF to fix the Brand Canvas output, which is currently unusable due to missing data and poor formatting.
- Scope & Timeline: This fix is free. Future development requires customer feedback. Trevor needs a working beta before his 10-11 day holiday break.

Topics

Problem: Unusable Brand Canvas Output

- The current Brand Canvas PDF is unusable, with missing data, poor formatting, and generic content.
- Root Cause: The app's GPT is a simple prompt-wrapper, not a custom GPT with a knowledge base. It lacks the core IDEA framework context from Trevor's book, leading to low-value outputs.
- Solution: Connect the GPT to Trevor's book PDF to provide the necessary framework and context for generating high-quality, structured outputs.

Solution: Define the Brand Canvas for Beta

- Beta Requirement: A functional Brand Canvas PDF that consolidates all user inputs from the IDEA framework.
- Format: A simple text-based document is acceptable for the beta to avoid complex formatting issues.
- Purpose: The canvas must be a standalone document for users to upload to other tools (e.g., image generators) or share with creators for on-brand content.

Solution: Connect GPT to Knowledge Base

- Matthew has a system knowledge base designed but not yet implemented.
- Initial Step: Trevor will provide his book PDF via WhatsApp for immediate integration.
- Future Step: Trevor will create a shared Google Drive folder for additional documents. Matthew will then build the integration to pull from this folder.

Other UI/UX Updates

- Brand Coach Chat History: The user's initial prompt disappears after the first response.
- Decision: The initial prompt will be kept visible at the top of the chat window for user context.

Next Steps

- Matthew:
  - Integrate Trevor's book PDF to fix the Brand Canvas output.
  - Implement the UI change to keep the initial prompt visible in Brand Coach.
  - Review the Freeform board to scope comments for the beta vs. future phases.
- Trevor: - Create and share a Google Drive folder with additional knowledge documents.
