0:00 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
The recorder in waiting room. Okay. Recording. Okay. It looks like we're good. Sometimes I get like 10 or 15 minutes into a meeting and I look and it's not recording. I'm like, oh my gosh, so yeah, but I think it's, good now. So now I just try and check at the beginning of the meetings.

0:24 - Trevor Bradford (Brandvoice)
Should be good, but everything went well with your aunt and her move, I take it. All good. Yeah.

0:31 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Yep. Um, I mean, it wasn't necessarily smooth sailing, but, uh, we, we got it done. So at the end of the day, that's what, that's the important thing. And she's all moved in and she's not in the cold Idaho anymore. So she's in warmer riverside. So that's cool.

0:50 - Trevor Bradford (Brandvoice)
Yeah. Moving house is always tough. think. Yeah.

0:55 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Yeah. Personally, I hate it.

0:57 - Trevor Bradford (Brandvoice)
Yeah. It's a very. Yeah, but I think she did it for the reason to be closer to her grandkids.

1:09 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
So I think she had a strong reason. And that probably pushed all of us through. yeah, she's all settled now, I think. So yeah, how's your how's your weekend? It's been busy.

1:30 - Trevor Bradford (Brandvoice)
I've had quite a few meetings, I've been out and about a lot, you know, doing various stuff. As Christmas approaches, quite a few bits of social catching up being done, you know, people not seen for a while, and just meet them either for lunch or a quick drink or something. We've got a virtual one of those this evening, and then some more of it next week. And then we're pretty much done, aren't we for the year? Mm-hmm. Nice. Nice.

2:00 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Yeah, I guess so. Yeah, I'm planning on working quite a bit the next couple of weeks, but I should definitely take some time out for friends and family, and I will. But yeah, the year's coming to a close. I think we're making decent progress, though, towards launching before the end of the year. Maybe we can still do it. I'm not sure. But yeah, I guess we'll get into some of that today.

2:43 - Trevor Bradford (Brandvoice)
Yeah, I'm good till four o'clock, man. don't expect it will take that amount of time. But just before four, I need to stop and just pull my other documents together for that meeting, just to put a timeframe on it a little bit. But apart from that, you know, if we need to catch up again, in short order, you know, happy to do that. Just to try and get this put to bed. My experience with it, and some of this will probably be pretty clear to you anyway, and other bits probably news because someone needed to use the app in its current form. So, starting at the beginning, I... Yeah.

3:31 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Actually, before you get started, I just want to give you an update because I did, I went through the free form last night, or yesterday, and I looked at some of the stuff. And then this morning, I actually went in and made some updates. So, there's been some changes, like the starting from, I guess, the end, like the copy generator. I looked and I... So it wasn't actually really hooked up to the context. So that's the latest change that I made. So I haven't fully tested it, but I did get it hooked up. And I think it's producing better results already. So we should verify that still.

4:30 - Trevor Bradford (Brandvoice)
All right. Shall I share my screen?

4:35 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Yeah, that sounds good. And then also just want to mention that I did go through the free form and I made several changes, especially for things where you called out that it's something that we already agreed on. Or we already we already had like discussed that we should do this. So. Trying to just close out the phase two and make sure it's all delivered from what we had agreed. But yeah, happy to go through, maybe we go through the free form and discuss it, and then we also go through the current state of things and discuss that. All right.

5:25 - Trevor Bradford (Brandvoice)
Well, to start with, I published the app, because I wanted to sort of use it in the context that an actual user would. And it published the old version, I think. So all my comments were made on the preview that is inside Lovable. Yeah.

5:48 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
OK, so we need to figure out why the publish didn't work, right?

5:51 - Trevor Bradford (Brandvoice)
Yeah. So I'll share this with you and just give you a top line.

6:04 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
I if I should try publishing, or maybe we wait until we've confirmed some things.

6:15 - Trevor Bradford (Brandvoice)
Yeah, let's just run through it, I think, and then, can you see the board? Yep. Great, okay. All right, so... When I first opened the preview, it gave me some security issues, so I just stuck them up there for your attention, because they didn't mean a great deal to me or anything that I could do to fix. So that was the first thing. The second thing was it opened on this page, which I think we'd agreed that we were going to hide it for the time being, because of the lack of functionality on some of the modules. Yeah. And all they did was add complexity and didn't actually deliver anything. So looking at the refresh page that I have, the start here page now is the thing that we begin with, which sort of replaces the home page, I expect, doesn't it? It's got the video in there and it looks very, very clean and, you know, uncomplicated. And I think that that's a really good start. Okay. Yeah.

7:28 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
there were also several pages that redirect to home. So they say like back to home or they'll go to the home page. So I made sure I tried to make sure all those also redirect to the start here. But let me know if you find any other ones in the future that that was not the case. Yep.

7:48 - Trevor Bradford (Brandvoice)
Right. So there's some looking up at the new home page or the start here page. I see that there's some simple instructions, complete your free brand. go. Yeah. Yeah. today. Diagnostic. Explore the Brand Canvas. Chat with the AI Coach. Access additional training videos. Okay. If you need help, use the AI chat for instant guidance. Check our video library for tutorials. Review the documentation. Contact support for assistance. Okay. A couple of things. I don't have a support function yet. So I don't know whether we should just remove the contact support. Or whether we build one. don't know how easy that is or not. Yeah, observations for the moment.

8:42 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Sorry, I think I was talking and I didn't hear what you said about that.

8:47 - Trevor Bradford (Brandvoice)
Yeah, I wonder whether we should just remove contact support for assistance because we haven't got a contact or a support chat set up. All, all, all, all. So rather than have people immediately resort to that, if anything's unclear, they're going to be frustrated because it doesn't exist.
ACTION ITEM: Add support email contact@ideabrandconsultancy.com to Start Here; add support to roadmap - WATCH: https://fathom.video/share/pYiVp6htpj7WTtyt227kUtvc9cAk1gCb?timestamp=553.9999 And it wasn't it wasn't part of the initial brief to you either. I'm quite aware of that. So. Maybe there ought to be an email contact support at and then an email address just in the text and make just make it a live link.

9:38 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Yeah, I think so. So I've just removed the line, but I'm going to add that to the roadmap so we have it documented.

9:52 - Trevor Bradford (Brandvoice)
Okay, so the email that I would use for this, I guess, would be the contact. Contact ideabrandconsultancy.com, yes.

10:13 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Okay, so that's a different domain than ideabrandcoach.com.

10:18 - Trevor Bradford (Brandvoice)
Yeah, it is, and simply because I haven't got that email all set up, and I've got so many emails that I end up having to manage that having yet another inbox I think for me right now would be particularly positive as a step forward. So contact ideabrandconsultancy.com, I think that will work fine. Okay. So if that's just a live link there, then, you know, think that will certainly do for the time being, you know, while we're at this stage. Cool. Okay, so back to the board for a moment, this was where it took me after the diagnostic, so your free brand diagnostic results are here, and then you can download them, but the back to home takes me back to this page that we had agreed with Archive, but that's gone now, because you've made the changes, so that's clear. Drilling down a bit further, that was basically it on that drill down, that page is fine, download your PDF report, but if I asked it to do that, he signed in, but it still asked me to create an account, the only option that I had was to go back to home again, and so you very It was just a circular nip thing. Right.

12:04 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
So that one, I worked through it. It should, so I haven't verified it yet. I basically did some first pass on several of these things. So we, I will need to go back and verify. But basically found out that it was not doing that check properly. So it, my, my coding agent told me that it fixed it, and then also the, the PDF generation was not currently working. So I, I'm not sure if that's something that you saw that before, maybe that the PDF generation didn't create. like a PDF on that page, but now it uses the Markdown Canvas export. Right, okay.

13:11 - Trevor Bradford (Brandvoice)
I don't really understand what Markdown is, Matt, to be honest, so you might need to sort of bring me up to speed on that a bit.

13:20 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
So that's the, I think before we had discussed how the Canvas PDF didn't really output a good format. And so my suggestion for like a simple kind of stopgap solution was we can just use Markdown format. So basically it's a format that's all text based. So I think it's one of the call outs you had later, too, that like, should we have this be text based? But it's easy for like AI to read and understand head. I'm link So we can explore other types of formatting later if this is not good for, or we can do it sooner if this is not good for launch, but it's, I mean, it's what I use, and I don't know, like, not everyone's going to be a developer, so we should cater to the audience, but for now, that's the sort of simple text output of These exports, and it can be fed to, at least is functional to be fed to like other AI tools. Right, okay.

14:39 - Trevor Bradford (Brandvoice)
And will a user, a typical Titan say, understand what to do with all of that? Do you think?

14:52 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Maybe. If you go to, I think if you go to the right, you have an example of it. So I'm not sure. sure little bit. It's But So, like, if you go, I think it's somewhere here, if you go right and down, there's that email, but that's not, so email clients might actually, so this is sort of what the format would look like if it's, if it's processed. So, like, basically, there's going to be, like, the number symbol can indicate a larger heading, so like that your idea framework submission. The text output will say, like, hashtag your idea framework submission, but something like an email client like this might process that and just automatically format it, so it shows up and looks like this. Right.

15:53 - Trevor Bradford (Brandvoice)
It's not very user friendly, would be my observation. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. That's. to come. I think are a little bit scary for users, and in a way, the way that ChatGPT, for example, gives you really nicely spaced responses, and that are really easy to just copy and paste into documents and things like that, that would be really what I think we need here, because I think just that the density of copy is going to be quite scary for some of them.

16:30 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Yeah, especially when there's clear delineations too, there's like numbers in there that's like six should be this, seven should be this, so those should be like spaced out. Yeah, exactly.

16:42 - Trevor Bradford (Brandvoice)
So it just needs to be made comprehensible and usable, you know, for the app user. We're jumping ahead a little bit. The thing about that output, that kind of output, is that... And my question about, should it be text? Because we're doing PDFs further back here. And the PDF formatting was still quite messed up, as you can see. And it stretched the logo. So if we can't solve the logo stretching problem, we should just get rid of it. Get rid of the logo. And we can just put a heading in there, ID a brand coach as a heading, customer avatar report instead of a logo in the short term, if that is a difficult fix.

17:37 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Okay.

17:39 - Trevor Bradford (Brandvoice)
So... I mean, forever. Even when I first started working on this myself, it was messing the logo about. Yeah.

17:50 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
There's got to be a tool that we can find to get the logo working right and exactly how you want it. Um, I just might need to look into it. So it might take some time. Um, and that would affect the budget. So in the meantime, if like, I'm, I'm sort of thinking that there might be several changes that we, we need to do like a, a phase three. Um, and we can include like several things in that phase three. Um, or we can opt for just quick follow ups that are like, okay, we, we do, um, we take an approach that's like the heading idea, the heading for idea brand coach, and we don't include the logo. And then we get that fixed across all the PDFs. So we have one strategy for all the PDFs. That's more just text based, but has like good spacing.
ACTION ITEM: Implement text-only PDF exports across app; remove logo; add heading - WATCH: https://fathom.video/share/pYiVp6htpj7WTtyt227kUtvc9cAk1gCb?timestamp=1137.9999 Um, that would. It still take me a little bit of time, but it wouldn't be like, okay, I have to go and test different softwares and try and get the logo right and everything.

19:08 - Trevor Bradford (Brandvoice)
I don't think Matt at this stage. I think we do need consistency of output. Otherwise, we end up confusing the end user. First of all, they got a PDF and then it was marked down and pure text. It just needs to be a consistent experience. So let's go with the Occam's razor approach, which is the simplest solution. It is a text output that is just formatted for readability. Let's not worry about logos. Let's just put the heading in there and move forward with that for the moment. Okay. Sounds good.

19:52 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Yeah.

19:54 - Trevor Bradford (Brandvoice)
So onto this page here, we'll... So we've arrived here on the menu, but we've got a submenu here. Do you think there ought to be a bit of text explanation here about moving from one element of the avatar to the other to the other to get the whole thing sort of completed? Or do you think it's obvious enough?

20:30 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
I think it's fairly intuitive, but I was actually imagining you having a training video at the top of this. Right. Okay. Now it could be a different, it could be like an overview training video for avatar 2.0 builder, and then individual videos. Bye,

21:03 - Trevor Bradford (Brandvoice)
I think it's likely to be an overview rather than a talking head, or a bit of both, you know, where the talking head introduces the page and then says this is how you use it, and then we just minimize the talking head into the top right hand corner or something like that, and I just do a screen capture of how to to walk through the avatar tool, that will probably be the best thing to do with that. But yeah, it can be a video.

21:43 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Yeah, I think what I'm thinking is it's not, it sounds like it might not be too much effort from my side, but I'll just need you to provide the videos. The minimization and moving to the top right corner. turner. at Uh. It's something I haven't done before. I don't know if there might be a little complexity there. We could just keep it simple and collapse and hide it, or just leave it at the top.

22:15 - Trevor Bradford (Brandvoice)
Yeah, I think being able to collapse the video or minimize it in some way is useful. In terms of the talking head being minimized within the video, I can do that in the edit. I'm pretty sure I know how to do it. Okay. So it's not going to be any programming or anything like that. It will just be within the video itself, within the edit that I'll provide. So no need to worry about that.

22:46 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Okay, sounds good. So I don't know, you can let me know if we're not done with this yet, but I'm not sure if we skipped over something from before. The copy generator. And.

23:01 - Trevor Bradford (Brandvoice)
Well, the copy generator sort of in the flow comes later, so we're sort of still at the very front end of the app. Sorry.

23:14 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Yeah, well, I meant this. I didn't mean the copy generator. meant this one to the left here that says start here. So you want the journey text on the next line or or it's sorry. You don't want that. You want just it to be more normal, like more separated.
ACTION ITEM: Fix widow on Start Here headline; add arrow - WATCH: https://fathom.video/share/pYiVp6htpj7WTtyt227kUtvc9cAk1gCb?timestamp=1412.9999 So maybe we say we just want it to be clear. So journey isn't left alone in the next line. Right. Yeah, exactly.

23:43 - Trevor Bradford (Brandvoice)
I'll just put an arrow in there as an aid man. yeah, it in the design world, that's called a widow. I don't know if you've come across that term before or not.

23:54 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Cool. No, not yet. Yeah, well, that it's very, very common.

23:58 - Trevor Bradford (Brandvoice)
common. And typographers hate it, you know, we always strive to avoid having one stranded word on a line like that, so that's, it's just good design practice, not to have widows, so that was all that was, really.

24:20 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Yeah, and I guess the question is, how do we make sure that that doesn't happen across screen sizes?

24:30 - Trevor Bradford (Brandvoice)
Well, when you've got, what's the term I'm searching for, when a website adjusts for screen size, remind me, Matt, what's the term?

24:47 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
I would just say dynamic, like dynamic size.

24:51 - Trevor Bradford (Brandvoice)
There's a term, isn't there, for, for a type of website, that previously, in old technology terms, didn't. We the screen size, we had to manually do it, but actually does adjust it if you, if you change the window shape on your screen or anything like that, there's a word for it, I can't remember what it is now, let's call it dynamic for the sake of it, so therefore the type changes, of course, so I'm not sure how we deal with that. This is a desktop, primarily a desktop app, at this stage, I don't even know how this works yet on a mobile, I haven't tried it, and so that's an exercise really.

25:38 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Yeah, I guess responsive might be the term.

25:42 - Trevor Bradford (Brandvoice)
Yes, responsive, I'm sure that's the right word. So with a responsive style of website or app, then it's harder to control whether or not you end up with a widow. But I guess my starting point is. But That if the screen is normal size, then our starting point shouldn't be Widow Widow, if you follow my drift.

26:12 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Yeah, I think we can we can maybe just move the line and then like split it somewhere just kind of manually.

26:24 - Trevor Bradford (Brandvoice)
Yeah, I mean, if if you were to do the line break, either after the word you're or after brand, so you ended up with two or three words here, then they're not that will probably do it.

26:41 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Yeah, OK, so I think so. There's a bit of a an issue going on, apparently, with lovable cloud. But you said right before your. Yeah.

26:56 - Trevor Bradford (Brandvoice)
Oh, no, after after the word between. The word your and brand, if we do the line break there. Okay, between the word your and... Yeah, and then we can just have a look at that.

27:18 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Okay, so I went into the code to edit it, and then I hit save, but I think there's also an issue with saving right now, potentially. Let me see if I hit refresh. Yeah, let me try on my local copy and see if I can push the change there. But if not, I might just do it after. Do you see the same thing, and when you go to lovable?

27:53 - Trevor Bradford (Brandvoice)
Yeah, I refresh it and change.

27:57 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Yeah, and there's like an orange band. Enter at the top that says like, yeah, okay, so you're, watch, so I was going to do a break right after welcome to idea brand coach, and then right after the word your.

28:31 - Trevor Bradford (Brandvoice)
So you're going to do a break after after brand coach. So, so welcome to idea brand coaches line one. Watch this introduction video to get started with line break your brand transformation journey. I'm not sure typographically that's optimal. I think we only need two lines, Matt. Okay. I'd break it around the word with, and so we end up with two lines of more or less equal number of characters, and it will look visually nicer than having a stacked three short sentences. I also think we might use it as well because I don't want these pages to become particularly long so that you have to scroll to get to the bottom. So let's try and keep it with two lines.

29:35 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Okay. Yeah.

29:37 - Trevor Bradford (Brandvoice)
Okay, so let's go back then to Avatar 2.0 here. So the what next question is here we talked about with a video. So I think I need to explore how I do that. It's probably going to be a screen capture video of some sort that just describes. It follows the pointer or the cursor of the mouse movement and explains that you go from demographics to psychology, to bio-behaviour, and so on. So that's okay, but I find that on the bottom of this page, it seems a bit pre-emptive. We're showing the customer avatar report when it hasn't been fully formatted or delivered because it's on the next page when we end up pulling all the various core values and primary fears and deep desires into that document. And then we go into psychology and that does the same process with its page. So in a way, I'm not sure if we should be showing this preview here because I don't know what it actually does for us and whether we should have just a simplified... All right. Page, which is just that part there. Does make sense? Yeah.

31:07 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
And then maybe there's just like a fifth one. Or like how do they know that they can generate a report at the end of this, I guess?

31:18 - Trevor Bradford (Brandvoice)
Well, I guess we should explain it beneath or above the input fields. So it said create a detailed behavioral avatar or create detailed behavioral avatars that capture emotional drivers and subconscious navigators, motivators. So there'll be a video in there, won't there, an instructional video for one thing that will explain that you go through each of these four steps. And then you get an output document, which is your customer report. But I think showing a preview of that. that. Bye. I don't know if it brings anything to the party or not. I mean, I'm open to conversation about it, but at all points, I'm trying to simplify and not be confusing. Yeah, I agree.

32:12 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
I think that simpler would be better because. Otherwise, they're they probably need to scroll down and it just feels busy. And if it's if it's not there, then it's just like I just need to focus on filling in these. And making sure these inputs are good. I don't have to like, I think it looks more professional if it's simpler and to the point. Yeah.

32:37 - Trevor Bradford (Brandvoice)
Yeah, I agree. And then in the video, I can probably show them what the the output will look like when they've completed all the inputs to it.

32:50 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
OK. And then, yeah, and then maybe. We I was thinking, like, there's a there can be a button below. go? lost And That either it's right below and it says, you know, like generate your customer avatar report, like it's recommended to fill out all the sections and you've only filled out this many or something, but you can always do it and it just has blank stuff, or we could be like, you know, we don't allow you to click this button until you fill out everything. Which I don't know if it's such a good idea, because people might just be so far along and only want to do this. Yeah, I agree. Yeah.

33:41 - Trevor Bradford (Brandvoice)
We should encourage people to fill out all the fields, but not make it mandatory. So at the moment, we've got this quite nice looking customer avatar report here as a preview. Is there, I mean, is this a live document that's previewed Matt? Yeah. So, as you add more things to it, does it change? That, I don't know. Because it would be great if the customer was able to actually preview their progress.

34:20 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Yeah, I think it is because when I put mine in and I say TCG Enthusiast, let's see if I add, yeah, actually if I add a letter even, it updates right away.

34:35 - Trevor Bradford (Brandvoice)
Okay. So, maybe that just ought to be a separate page that is the preview page, so people can see how far they've progressed.

34:47 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
The other thing, actually, I just thought of is, so these, it might be too simple if we completely remove it and have it as a separate page. Basic demographics. Basic demographics. Basic demographics. It'll just be, well, I don't know. I was thinking it could be cool if it's side by side, but then that still might be too busy, and maybe it's better to be a separate page.

35:15 - Trevor Bradford (Brandvoice)
Yeah, it just seems to fall between two stalls here, doesn't it? It's either, and it doesn't actually output in the way that it looks. So this is a really quite a nice-looking layout on the page, and I think it would be great to see that from the user's point of view as they progress in some kind of way.

35:50 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Yeah, we could do like a preview button next to a download button, and then when they hit the preview, button, then this thing shows up, and that way it's not busy on the page unless they want to see it, and then we could have a preview and hide, so it will, so they can hide it as well, and then I feel like exporting it with the same format shouldn't be, shouldn't be too difficult, like it's, the format's already created, and displayed on this webpage, so we should be able to, to make that happen pretty, pretty easily.

36:41 - Trevor Bradford (Brandvoice)
Okay, well that, that would be a great solution if you can do that.

36:47 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
And then if we can do that, we could potentially even reuse that same format instead of the markdown format for other things. I can explore that. OK, great.

37:02 - Trevor Bradford (Brandvoice)
So as we go through the various menu buttons here, it takes you on to your various pages. So the psychology button from this page takes you to this screen here. And we've got it says understand what drives your customer emotionally and psychologically. So that is an invitation to. Allow some kind of interaction to me suggests that, but none of these plus buttons. Actually work, they're not live. OK. Which is, you know, a little bit again, confusing and a bit strange. Just. Yeah, I'm just looking at I'm on the live app now and they don't do anything. Where you would you would expect. I don't know. No. don't I don't know why they're there, other than it's a livable, foible, it thought it would be good to put plus buttons there, but it didn't give it any function when this page was being built. So are we asking the user to, I'm thinking this through as I go, so forgive me if I'm being a bit rambler here. So I'm just looking at the, yeah.

38:34 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Well, yeah, I don't see why we have a plus button on the side, because, like, there's automatically populated things that you can click, like family, and those are the ones I want to use right away without typing, like, just naturally, I went to click, like, okay, yeah, success, freedom, security, for when I was filling it out for my brand. So I think we could just remove

39:00 - Trevor Bradford (Brandvoice)
Did leave that side plus button, really? No, actually I figured out how it works. I should have seen it, Matt. What happens is that if you type in a value here and then click the plus button, it adds it in a yellow bubble. Oh, okay. And it prompts you to select from this row here to add to the core values in the psychographic profile. But if there's also, you've got a set of values that you already used, you can add those as well. And by typing them in here and hitting the plus button. So it does function. Okay. I wasn't using it the right way. Okay. Cool. So we know that that's false.

39:50 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
So I noticed that if you add comma separated values, it adds one. That's entry that's comma separated. So like, we could probably pretty quickly just enable it where if they add a comma separated values, it adds like a separate value. Yeah.

40:17 - Trevor Bradford (Brandvoice)
So should I do that? That's good to understand what's going on there, isn't it? Because I thought that Liverpool had just put something in there that had no purpose or meaning, but I wasn't looking at it the right way. So that was my goal. Yeah.

40:32 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Can I show you something just real quick, just to make sure? Yeah. Stop sharing. So what I meant to say was like this, like if I if I type in something and then something else, it will it will add them as one entry. So what we do pretty easily is just like make it make this. Plus button, identify these as separate values, and put those separately. So that's all I saying.

41:07 - Trevor Bradford (Brandvoice)
Yeah. Great shout out. Okay.

41:11 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Cool. That was it. Stop sharing.

41:33 - Trevor Bradford (Brandvoice)
Okay. Can you see that Matt? Is that sharing for you now? Yeah. You see the board? Okay. Great. Yeah. So on the buying behaviour, there was, again, it's asking for added decision factor, and we know how that plus button works now, but we're not giving any sort of... Decision factors for the user to choose from. Do you think that's a problem or is that okay?

42:10 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Let's see, decision factors, where's, oh, okay. It's like the same type of thing, just on buying behavior. Yeah, I think it's kind of unclear what decision factor might mean if someone's not familiar. So, or like, yeah, but I don't know if that's some, is that something that we could suggest or is it more based on the particular avatar?

42:42 - Trevor Bradford (Brandvoice)
It's possibly likely to be based on the avatar and the product and the customers, the shopper journey, you know, and obviously how you would decide to buy a phone case versus... Decision factor for a phone case versus a base screen are obviously going to be completely different, but I'm still a company potentially for both, but it's a different process. Yeah, maybe.

43:16 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
So there's two options. Either we could just have them type it in or we could have like an AI suggestion that pulls from the current knowledge base and suggests factors.

43:27 - Trevor Bradford (Brandvoice)
Yeah, I think an AI assistant assistant button would would be helpful, which is the note that I put on just here, as you can see. Oh, yeah.

43:39 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
OK.

43:41 - Trevor Bradford (Brandvoice)
Yeah. So having having AI assistant as a suggestion, even if you type something in, you can still ask for AI to suggest more and see what it comes back with. And that's how it functions further down, isn't it, with the AI assistant.

44:02 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Trevor, have you thought more about the idea of like pre-filling with existing documents or even just adding a pre-filling function where if they work with the brand coach, then they can pre-fill like a lot of the stuff?

44:26 - Trevor Bradford (Brandvoice)
Well, I think it's a really good idea, and we do do that, don't we, on the brand coach page?

44:35 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Do we? I wasn't sure if we had that function to like populate the rest of the app with… No, I don't think it backfills.

44:46 - Trevor Bradford (Brandvoice)
It's just where I'm trying to find it. Here we are. It says share your knowledge documents. In order to engage with the AI… So that's there, and we explain how it works, but I don't think it backfills. Now, what would be really useful if users have knowledge documents already, and there's an option to put them in at the start of the process to see if the app will front load any of these values. But I don't know how complicated all that is from a coding point of view. It sounds pretty complicated. It's a great idea, I think, but it's sort of out of my wheelhouse, really.

45:40 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
I think that nowadays it's definitely less complicated than it used to be, and I could take a stab at it, especially for populating at the beginning, because if we do it, if we decide we want to enable it for later. do it that be Then there's the conflicts problem of like, if you type something in already, or you had something there already, and then you up, you want to backfill, like, how do we, how do we handle those updates? And there might be need to be some sort of UI thing built in there, which would be complex and like, you know, take a lot. But if we just want to pre fill right when they're starting, I think that might be somewhat straightforward. I think it's worth exploring. It's a great idea.

46:40 - Trevor Bradford (Brandvoice)
love it.

46:41 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Yeah. Okay.

46:45 - Trevor Bradford (Brandvoice)
If there's anything that we can do that takes any need to think too hard and end up typing into the field, for the, for the user is going to deliver a better use. Okay. lost And we'd like to use whatever work they've done up to now anyway, because they've done some preliminary brand building. I'll be amazed if we end up with people who've never done any work at all, and they're starting from zero.

47:19 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Yeah, I kind of think that that's going to be, that's like a customer expectation that is very important that people will be like, I wish, like, I wish I didn't have to type all this in, especially nowadays. Yeah, it's a great idea. So maybe, like, we can reuse the component to upload your knowledge base, your documents that we already have from the coach page to the start here page. Then it's just a matter of building a component with, like, I would use a few prompts to build a component. bit. little bit about like, might so I'm That That can pre-populate all the data, and I guess the part that might be problematic is just testing and making sure that it does it right, but I can't see it taking more than like a few hours, like maybe an hour or two in the best case.

48:28 - Trevor Bradford (Brandvoice)
Okay. Sounds great. I think that would be a big improvement. Okay.

48:38 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Okay.

48:41 - Trevor Bradford (Brandvoice)
Right. So where were we? Yeah. So that takes us to the end of that module, Avatar Builder. So the next one along is the interactive inside, which is this one here. Okay. Thank you. Thank And again, we've got a menu. I don't know if it's clear enough. It might well be. Again, if I do an instruction video that can be minimized, so it's not taking up all of the screen all the time with my mug peering out at you while you're doing your work, and we want to be able to minimize the video. Then I can just do a quick introduction to the page. So, yeah, I can do that. I'll give myself a note. Okay.

49:49 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Sorry, I'm just going to grab my water bottle and be right back. Okay.

49:52 - Trevor Bradford (Brandvoice)
you very much. Thank you.

49:57 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Thank you. Thank

50:00 - Trevor Bradford (Brandvoice)
Okay, so there'll be an intro video up here for the page, right, so my next comment was that these are live links on these three panels, the interactive framework, the bio-intentional research, and the emotional assessment, which is great, but there are no links under the boxes beneath. And again, do we need another video here that says this is an educational thing, I'm explaining to you the five core insight components, they're not functional, or what really, and in fact, the relevant graphics, that's a bit of a hangover from the avatar as well, isn't it? Yeah.

50:58 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
So this is...

51:00 - Trevor Bradford (Brandvoice)
The page that was generated by Lovable to its own agenda, you know, when it was given brief, I don't think I or the other developers told it to lay out the page in this way, it made suggestions and went ahead and did it, and the shopper type and the relevant demographics, they're part of Avatar, as is emotional triggers and bio-motivation and bio-intent, so those I think that whole panel could go, you know, that whole, this whole section here, because I just don't see what purpose it's serving, and it's confusing if we've already been through the Avatar Builder.

51:46 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Got it, yeah, and then, so this, can you remind me, so the purpose of this interactive insight module, it says, from guessing to to knowing... Which intrigues me, because it's like, okay, how can I validate my theories? And then there's buyer intent research, there's emotional assessment. So I get the sense that there's going to be some sort of, like, validation through research, but I'm not sure if that's what your idea is.

52:25 - Trevor Bradford (Brandvoice)
Validation through research, other than the AI doing research for you.

52:31 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Yeah.

52:32 - Trevor Bradford (Brandvoice)
coming back with its opinion, which we know, you know, may or may not be 100% accurate. So I'm wondering about this whole page matter. Okay. Yeah.

52:52 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
There's also the issue of, like, I think you called out at one point that we want the copy generator to be the... go. This Let's go. Okay. Anything. All But visible on the top bar, and like, on the desktop, I think, right now, with all the pages, it's not visible because there's just not enough space. So I had to add the more drop-down thing. So maybe it would be more valuable to show the copy generator on the top bar than to have this module.

53:24 - Trevor Bradford (Brandvoice)
Yeah, well, this module here uses elements from my Avatar 2.0 model from the book. Okay. they are all part of this whole thing here. So we've got buying behavior, psychology, demographics, voice. But then we've got, we're saying, analyze search terms and customer behavior patterns to understand purchase drivers and decisions. And we're. And I don't know if this whole module is, if it's not redundant.

54:07 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Yeah, I mean, maybe, like, so the Avatar 2.0 one is kind of lacking in instructions and guidance, and then this is all instructions and guidance. So maybe we sort of merge the two into the Avatar 2.0 builder and include, like, your trainings, your video trainings, and maybe additional text and icons in the Avatar 2.0 builder to kind of merge them. I think that's a really good idea.

54:41 - Trevor Bradford (Brandvoice)
Because I think, again, Lovable, with its best intentions, probably, took my book and created an app framework from it. That was one of the original instructions to say, you know, read the book, understand the framework. see. way left- We need Now let's build an app to deliver that. And this is one of the pages that it delivered. But I think looking at it really critically, I find this all a bit confusing. And I wrote the book, and I find it a bit confusing as opposed to, you know, just simple clarity, you know, just here it is, this is answer to questions here, or get AI suggestion to build your avatar. And your avatar ought to have, by intent, an emotional, emotional relevance in there, it ought to reference the shopper types in the Shopify research document that I use in my framework, and also in my GPT training documents. Relevant demographics are a know. Or then, whatever else is relevant, after you've been through all the other stuff.

56:13 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
I think it makes sense to me that like, in your book, you would, maybe, I'm not sure if this is how it is, but maybe you laid out the framework with Avatar stuff, and then you dove more into the details in the later chapters. And then that's how it pulled out this, okay, like, let's go into detail now with interactive insight. But for an application, you want to walk them through it and explain right at the place where they put in the information. So, not sure if all that's accurate, but that's just what I'm thinking.

56:47 - Trevor Bradford (Brandvoice)
I'm just going to open up the Avatar section of the book.

56:51 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Okay. Give me one second.

56:59 - Trevor Bradford (Brandvoice)
Give me one second. Just get to the avatar bit. I think I know what it's done, but I'll stop sharing and share this with you. So this is the framework itself, it's got the four quadrants. So. pillars that underpin everything that the framework offers, and then we get to a point where we talk about the avatar, and this is the avatar tool that sits in the insight section of the framework, so you do your customer avatar work, and obviously that delivers insights to you. And it's across these five sections, the buyer intent, you know, what is it, you know, describe it, the motivations, what tasks are to be achieved by the product, what are the emotional triggers, what type of shopper are you, and what are the other relevant demographics. So this is where it's called the, from guessing to knowing, about building a detailed profile, and understanding the why behind it. Thank And the decisions that you're customary takes. Yeah.

59:04 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Well, I explain all this stuff in detail.

59:09 - Trevor Bradford (Brandvoice)
Well, yeah. And it's taken that and sort of conflated all of it.

59:18 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Yeah, and there's so much detail that gets lost in just filling out a form on the application. So I'm wondering, like, because there are going to be people, especially like your target audience, that want to really dive in and understand more detail about your framework, right? So we should almost have like an expandable reference in the avatar, like right where they put in the information. So sure. It be something that, because if, like, let's say we have AI helping to fill out some of the fields, it would be really cool if they could visually see that, okay, like, you know, for the emotional triggers, like, these, this is all the context from the book that Trevor wrote, and if I just click this AI suggestion button, you know, this is what it's pulling in order to help me expand on my answer.

1:00:43 - Trevor Bradford (Brandvoice)
Will this help? I mean, we've got the basics of a graphic here that explains the framework. And we don't have that in the app, really, what we have, we've got framework there, let's see. Let's See what the live version is doing with that inside the framework. Yeah, okay.

1:01:13 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
So if we think about actually like the different avatars of just like users who are using the app, right? Like there's going to be people who are more visual and then there's going to be people who are more text oriented and like want to read text. And I wonder if it's in our best interest to cater to both. So like if you do a video presentation, then maybe you do a presentation that goes through all these visuals in your presentation. And, and then potentially also have like an expandable reference on, on the page, which we can, we can talk about when to. Prioritize on the roadmap and stuff, but I'm just thinking, I like to think about the overall big vision so that we can identify what we want to build now, but it'd be really cool if we would cater to all types of learning so that people can just, we can really capture more of the audience.

1:02:24 - Trevor Bradford (Brandvoice)
So this is, can you see this yet? Yeah. This is more now. So the framework is sort of explained here, but really the framework is the IDEA, IDEA element, and this really only works for the first quadrant, and that was because when we first looked at the We decided that there was no functionality for at least two of the other quadrants on that page that we archived. So that's why there's no clear explanation now of the four pillars. Okay. Right.

1:03:19 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Because we took it away at the start.

1:03:23 - Trevor Bradford (Brandvoice)
Yeah. Well, I said take it away, not when we didn't decide to do it, but it was, you know, I'm thinking this through what we actually lost. I'll just change again.

1:03:39 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Yeah, because that is like my first question when I load the app is like, okay, what does IDEA stand for? Yeah.

1:03:48 - Trevor Bradford (Brandvoice)
See, this, come on board, move. This here, you see that section, Matt? Yeah.

1:03:59 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
good. Yeah.

1:04:01 - Trevor Bradford (Brandvoice)
Insight driven, distinctive, the explanation, and I wonder whether or not that page ought to be, ought to have a video for each section of the IDEA. Yeah, that's a good idea. So there's explanation at the start. Oh, Christ, I'm sort of deconstructing the whole app here. Do you know what, I think I'm going to retrace my steps and say that this page actually is important. And then I need to do a short video for each element of it. And perhaps the... The overview video that sits on this page ought to be here on the overview of the brand framework process because I introduce it so it makes sense that this is it. I maybe ought to shorten that video a bit and then do specific ones for each of these panels.

1:05:29 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Nice, yeah, and then the start here, we can remove the start here from the the overhead tab and just have the maybe the home button, bring the home button back. Yeah.

1:05:42 - Trevor Bradford (Brandvoice)
Yeah, I've lost sight of that. I think that by trying to simplify it, I chopped away actually the explanation of what it was. Okay. Yeah, it was fine. Um.

1:06:00 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
This stuff happens all the time with app design. So things come back, things go away. So the important thing from my point of view is that I keep the page there and don't delete it, which I've done.
ACTION ITEM: Build collapsible video component; add to Start Here, Avatar, Canvas - WATCH: https://fathom.video/share/pYiVp6htpj7WTtyt227kUtvc9cAk1gCb?timestamp=3972.9999 So it's easy to switch back.

1:06:18 - Trevor Bradford (Brandvoice)
Yeah.

1:06:23 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
I think one thing that we need is the component of the collapsible video, because we don't have it collapsible yet. I'm not saying it's going to be difficult. I'm just saying that's something that seems like we'll reuse across several places. So I just wanted to call that out or note it down in the transcript.

1:06:52 - Trevor Bradford (Brandvoice)
Yeah, I think I think that's what I've got to do. Okay. But what I need to be careful of, I think, Matt, is that this doesn't get stuck between being an app and a training course.

1:07:23 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Yeah, because we could be building the training course in the app. But, yeah, that's a great call-out because if you have a training course that you're already creating, like, I think you are right with the Mastermind. I will.

1:07:45 - Trevor Bradford (Brandvoice)
I haven't done it yet. That was why I was working on the digital clone so that I didn't have to do all the camera work and edit. I could just type in the text and it would do a decent job. of presenting the idea, and that's the purpose of that really, so that I don't have to do a lot of camera work, and I think, I wonder whether or not there ought to be a page that's just a simple set of links to training videos when they're done, and where you can do a deep dive, but they're not integral to the app, because if you're going to use the app more than once, and that's the intention, that's the hope, that it's a tool that you use regularly as you're launching new products and needing assistance with new poppy, launching new brands, that you come back to it and use it over and over, and actually there's some stickability with it, not just a once and done kind of exercise. Thank Right.

1:09:01 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
And you probably want to refresh your, the training, like watch the training again right before you do this piece, right? So I think it would be good to have the video right there, especially so they don't have to go to another app to watch the video. But that's just my opinion. Yep. Then if we can, if we can sort of abstract the training aspect to a video and just assume that the training part is a lot of it, a lot of the details handled in the video. Then we can simplify the application UI to be more general, and just kind of show the high level ideas. And then it's like, you watch this video to get more details.

1:09:57 - Trevor Bradford (Brandvoice)
Yeah.

1:10:00 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
The only thing I'm thinking is, when I use AI, I like to have a text representation. So like, it would be useful to have the video and then also a transcript of the video available somehow. Because, like, if I get lazy, I'll just want to take the transcript of the video and be like, you know, this is my brand document. This is Trevor's training, feed them both into ChatGPT. And say, me, you know, help me fill out this form on this web page.

1:10:36 - Trevor Bradford (Brandvoice)
That's okay. I can do that. Because if you think about it, I'm writing the text in the first place to get the digital clone to present it. So the text will exist before the video. Yeah.

1:10:53 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Are you actually writing out every word of the text, by the way?

1:10:58 - Trevor Bradford (Brandvoice)
Well, I'm getting... Well, getting... It's a combination of what I've already written, sections from the book, so I maintain consistency. Okay. Also, putting them into ChatGPT to say, okay, I want a two-minute script for this to explain the principles here, and it will give me a script, and then I'll put that into 11 labs to generate the audio, and I'll play it back, and I'll listen to it to see, first of all, if it makes sense when it's presented, as opposed to a section from the book, and whether or not the voice is articulating it correctly, with the right kind of emphasis, and all that stuff. And then, when it gets to a point where I'm happy with it, which usually doesn't take too long, then you just press the button that says generate, and it does, and it gives you an audio, and you download that, and upload it into HeyJoke. And on the video, Visual Clone speaks, so that's the process. Yeah.

1:12:05 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Okay. I think that's a great process. I might just recommend to have a document where you have the process defined, because then you can basically, like any back and forth that you notice between, okay, like it's not presentable, at this stage, so I have to do this every time. Like if there's anything that gets repeated, you can just update your process document, and then hopefully at some point you just end up having like one shot from the thing you pull to like, okay, it's pretty much 99% of the time is a solid video.

1:12:52 - Trevor Bradford (Brandvoice)
Yeah. And I'll keep the text transcript obviously in the document. Thank you. But for each video, so if you want, and I understand why you would want to do this, if you want, just have a view transcript button, it will just show you the text, and that's easy from my point of view, because I've already written it, to get it to speak in the first place.

1:13:21 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Yeah, yeah, I think that would be great, especially with these, these AI browsers. You know what, if someone's using an AI browser, I wonder if they could use that AI browser to populate the fields. That would be something interesting, and then we wouldn't have to build that feature. But, but the AI browser would also be able to help with, if it has access to that transcript, then it would provide much better inputs, or outputs, I mean.

1:13:57 - Trevor Bradford (Brandvoice)
And if, if alongside the transcript... View transcript, there's a simple little copy icon for people who just copy that, paste it into whatever document or other AI or browser that they're working with at the time.
ACTION ITEM: Reinstate Strategic Brand Building Journey page; move overview video above explanation - WATCH: https://fathom.video/share/pYiVp6htpj7WTtyt227kUtvc9cAk1gCb?timestamp=4453.9999 Again, it just makes life so much easier for them. Yeah.

1:14:21 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Yeah, okay.

1:14:24 - Trevor Bradford (Brandvoice)
Right, so just to recap then, we're going to reinstate the strategic brand building journey page, the homepage on the menu. I'm going to do videos for each of those panels there. I'll talk about insight, instinctiveness, empathy, and authenticity. I'll talk about brand diagnostic. That's the purpose, basically, of the whole app, really. We're going to have an upload document. Adrian. there's Upload your knowledge documents before we start the avatar, so that the avatar can pull from that anything that is valid or relevant, so that the user doesn't have to retype all that in. So that makes sense as well. We're then getting to the...

1:15:28 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Does that come before the brand diagnostic, or would it be after? Because the brand diagnostic might just be like the person's general feeling, right?

1:15:37 - Trevor Bradford (Brandvoice)
So we don't necessarily want the brand diagnostic is definitely the first thing, because what we want to do is give them a score to say, hey, look, you're so far along the continuum, you're doing okay, you're doing fair, you're doing great, or no, this is not really working. And that's what the brand diagnostic does. And if you recall, Matt, that's going to be the lead magnet. Also for the app. I want people to be able to access that for free. We do a data capture, and if they then want to download a report or engage with any of the other tools, they have to sign up, create an account, and decide if they want to pay for the tool or not.

1:16:24 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Got it. Okay, so manual fill-out is best for this.

1:16:27 - Trevor Bradford (Brandvoice)
Yeah, for the very first one, the diagnostic, it's a simple checklist thing anyway, so that's all right. There's no need needed. It's just based on their opinion of their brand across these six sets of questions.

1:16:44 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Got it. Okay. Cool.

1:16:46 - Trevor Bradford (Brandvoice)
And at some point, this is where the paywall will sit between the diagnostic and the rest of the app.
ACTION ITEM: Remove Diagnostic from nav bar; keep pre-login - WATCH: https://fathom.video/share/pYiVp6htpj7WTtyt227kUtvc9cAk1gCb?timestamp=4618.9999 So in a way. Yeah. This layout that we're looking at here, the diagnostic should actually sit on the other side of this.

1:17:09 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Yeah, yeah. I wonder if we even remove the diagnostic from the home navigation bar, because it's meant to be before they sign up. And once they're in, I mean, the whole experience is kind of the diagnostic in a way. Good shout.

1:17:30 - Trevor Bradford (Brandvoice)
I think that's a really good idea. Okay.

1:17:36 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
That way it doesn't clutter up the navigation bar too. Yeah.

1:17:40 - Trevor Bradford (Brandvoice)
And it doesn't confuse people by making them think they've got to go back and do it again. However, that said, further down the process somewhere. Where was it? might take a longer happened. Thank It might have been in the copy generator. We are prompted to do the diagnostic again. Where has it gone?

1:18:26 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
There's a couple of prompts to start at the brand framework, and those take us to the home page.

1:18:34 - Trevor Bradford (Brandvoice)
Yeah. That prompts us to start with the brand framework. So that's a good reason to put that page back in again. Thank you very No, it's the brand framework it prompts us to do that, but we should have already done that at the start back here, so the point that I was going to make with these pages is that the canvas ought to be able to pull all of the stuff that's already been either created or inputted so that they don't have to start over, so that there's a summary working document that is already present.

1:19:36 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Right, and that's, are we talking about, sorry, I was on another screen, but we're talking about the copy generator pulling the brand canvas, right?

1:19:46 - Trevor Bradford (Brandvoice)
Yeah, this is the brand canvas, and then the copy generator comes later, but the brand canvas for sure, you know, we're, I mean, each one of these potentially should have a short video as well, because this is... just an educational page.

1:20:04 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Well, actually, if you scroll down, though, that's where you do inputs, right?

1:20:09 - Trevor Bradford (Brandvoice)
Yeah, these are the fields where we fill it in. But this part of the page, the other part that we scroll past, there's no functionality here at all. It just explains what each of these eight strategy steps are.

1:20:26 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Yeah, and then if you click, you can actually click and it'll scroll to where you input, which is okay, but we could make it better.

1:20:38 - Trevor Bradford (Brandvoice)
These little arrow things here, aren't they, that do that?

1:20:45 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
It would be cool if it opened up into, like, a modal that has the video and then the input right there. I'm just trying to think of how to add the video. I'm just says? av situations bad, board. But I'm

1:21:01 - Trevor Bradford (Brandvoice)
Yeah, those little arrows do do that, Matt. They take you down to the field that you have to fill in. So there is a functionality, actually.

1:21:12 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
So maybe the other idea is instead of having a new modal thing, we use the existing click to scroll down, and then once they land there, then there's a collapsible video that they can open up and see the video.

1:21:38 - Trevor Bradford (Brandvoice)
It's going to be an awful lot of video in this app, I think.

1:21:44 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Yeah, but I think it's in line with the name, like brand coach, like you have a coach with you the whole time.

1:21:53 - Trevor Bradford (Brandvoice)
Yeah. Okay, well I think, I don't want to overwhelm the user with video, but I take the point. So moving down to here, the brand data summary, at this point in the process, although I'd been through all of these pages and filled out various fields, the canvas progress was still showing at zero.

1:22:34 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Yeah, so the, I took a stab at updating the idea insights, where it says pending. If they filled out all the fields, it should say completed. Now, same with the avatar profile, if they filled out all the fields in Avatar 2.0, it should say completed. Canvas progress. Okay.

1:23:00 - Trevor Bradford (Brandvoice)
It should be based on this form, so this page, the purpose, vision, mission, so if you fill out, like, one of those, if you have anything there, it'll show, like, one-eighth percentage, 13%, 13%, 13%, it shows the progress once you started to fill those fields in, yeah, and then, as you can see here, it shows the canvas is complete by that point, because I've been through all of those eight fields, and I exported the canvas, and it comes out looking like that, which is better, actually, the previous one, but we do need consistency, it either, everything should look like that, or everything should just be text, you know, we've got a bit of a mix at the minute, of logos on PDFs, or just plain text, Okay.

1:23:57 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
So, the, and then,

1:24:00 - Trevor Bradford (Brandvoice)
Then we came to the copy generator, so we have this continued building, and it prompts you to go back and complete your strategy, but if we've already done that, as we can see here, what's the link, how does the user access that if they want to use the work that they've done, on the strategy to build some copy?

1:24:35 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Right, so visually, they should have some sort of validation that they've, you know, their copy generator is sort of like powered up with all their stuff that they've put in. Yeah.

1:24:50 - Trevor Bradford (Brandvoice)
Do you remember we talked about, we weren't sure which GPT was actually driving this app. Uh, I'm unclear about it, but when I look at the answers that this is generating here, for example, it's a bit limited. I mean, I'm getting some really amazing in-depth stuff out of my chat GPT idea one, and also the GPT-5 that has the latest thing.

1:25:27 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Yeah, so this—I looked into this because I saw your comments, and it was—apparently it was not even—it was, like, doing a very basic sort of hard-coded prompt for the copy generator. So I went in and I hooked it up to the user knowledge base that we've now set up, that I've helped to set up. So I would test it again and see. If there's improved results now. Okay.

1:26:06 - Trevor Bradford (Brandvoice)
But I returned some work on one of my own listings. I did a complete new competitor audit because there's been a lot of people come into the market on one of my products, on my hair serum. And GPT-5, although I've been working with it since, not five, but ChatGPT, MyChatGPT. Since it was first launched, you know, 18 months ago. So it's got to know me and what I do really well. And my understanding is that your ChatGPT will give you different answers to mine because it knows you and knows your interests. So these things begin to understand who is using them and work accordingly. And mine knows my frameworks inside out. They know, even the one that hasn't got the knowledge. a have you,ución. So Thank Documents attached to it, the idea one, just my general chat GPT, because it's had so many conversations with me, it knows the stuff really, really well, and it was giving me some incredibly in-depth analysis on the competitors versus my listening. Now, some of it I don't know if I agree with or not, so we've got the issue of do we trust these things 100%, and the answer is absolutely not 100%, but they do a lot of groundwork. It's provided us with stuff that at least we can challenge ourselves and say, hang on a minute, I don't agree with that, or I do agree with this, and that's really clever. So if that, if my GPT could be the thing that drives this out, we're probably going to get the best possible results, rather than just a general chat GPT hookup that has no experience of dealing with I'll you... ... ...

1:28:07 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
So they got me thinking because we've been basically building a user knowledge base based off of the inputs to this app so far up to this point. I wonder, mean, we're calling OpenAI APIs. I wonder if there's a way to sort of add a hookup to each user's like ChatGBT account and just say, you know, can you just connect to their knowledge base in the back end with like clicking a button right when they sign up?

1:28:48 - Trevor Bradford (Brandvoice)
That would be really cool.

1:28:50 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
I wonder if that's a thing. Up until now, I've just been thinking like, I mean. no. Decision I We could provide a few prompts that pull data, but there's only so much data you could get with that, where you ask the user to copy and paste the prompt into ChatGPT and paste the output into here to just do some knowledge transfer. But that seems pretty low-tech. If we could connect it in the back end. I wonder if I can just ask Claude right now and just see.

1:29:30 - Trevor Bradford (Brandvoice)
Because in the end, Matt, it's all about the quality of the output, isn't it? Yeah. Because if you've just got a fancy wrapper around a very, very basic GPT, it's a bit, so what, you know, what are we paying for?

1:29:49 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Yeah. So, can I just share my screen with Do you know about my work on the brand idea website?

1:30:24 - Trevor Bradford (Brandvoice)
Sorry, are you sharing that with me? Yeah, okay.

1:30:29 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
I think I've worked with it before, so I think it should. I'm just trying to pull up that context. And then, okay. We are trying to improve the quality of the outputs of the brand coach GPT within the app. And we had this idea to... Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Thank For each user, we would enable the user to connect their own personal ChatGPT account or OpenAI account to our website application in the back end so that our website application would be able to reference the user's ChatGPT knowledge base, which will have a lot of that user's context, especially if they've been working on their brand using ChatGPT, which most customers will be. Is something like that doable where we can enable a button in our web application to connect with ChatGPT for each user? Yes, so we'll see. Let's it says. I think it sort of depends if OpenAI exposes this capability, and it's sort of up to them if they think it's advantageous for them or not. I could see it going both ways. Can you check 2025 updates and any plans for 2026? It's not done, I'm not putting it. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. you. Thank Manual. Let users input their own API key. It's interesting. So how would that work? If they did their own API key, they would sort of... We would supply the prompts, and I think we could supply the system knowledge base. Oh, it doesn't access their history? Okay, so that's not what we want then. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank Yeah, they might not want to do that, because then, essentially, their useful data is all that context that they've been collecting, so that's what they've been heavily investing in, and they don't want to just let it go outside of their sort of ecosystem. What you want, pull ChatGPT user data to your app, what apps SDK does, your app runs inside ChatGPT, apps receive contacts from current conversation only, or what to connect your app's account to ChatGPT.
ACTION ITEM: Investigate OpenAI/ChatGPT user-context integration; report back to Trevor - WATCH: https://fathom.video/share/pYiVp6htpj7WTtyt227kUtvc9cAk1gCb?timestamp=5682.9999 Okay, I can look into this more offline, and I can also, I'm planning to do... I a development call coach in my network with, like, the next phase and just how we move forward. So I can also surface this idea just like how do we optimize the quality of the outputs, right? I'm going to share this with you. So, sorry, I'm not sure. You said you had some preparation to do before your next call, right? Yeah, I have to hop off in a minute, Matt.

1:35:51 - Trevor Bradford (Brandvoice)
I'm sorry. Let's have a quick look. What did he say? Oh, this is the chat that you had in the call. Yeah. Yep. . . . . . . .

1:36:00 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
But I'll go through this, and I'll go through the art transcript. If there's anything else you want to cover before you hop off, we can do that. And then I'll go, I'll discuss the project with my coaches, and we'll see. I want to come back to you with like a plan for next steps. I am thinking that there's probably some amount of work that I can just do that's like simple updates. But then there will be some, like, phased and paid follow ups or like, additional work that I just can't prioritize doing, you know, free work after a certain point. So I'm, I'm hoping to plan to, to, to charge like $1,000 per phase. No. Normally, I think that, like, and I could use the money now, but I think that I know that you have a limited budget, and I know that we're trying to really get this thing over the line, and, like, maybe it would make more sense to do smaller sections of, like, $500 phases. So I'm willing to do that. Okay.

1:37:33 - Trevor Bradford (Brandvoice)
Where I'd like to get with this, Matt, is that this, where we are now, has its bugs ironed out so that it makes sense to an end user that I can put it into beta so that we get some real user feedback. Because I think, you know, I'm beginning to get a bit close to it. And what I'd like... So to happen is for people to use it and say hey yeah this is good or I found this confusing and I wouldn't do this and I wouldn't do that and where do I find this function which I'd really like so that if we're spending further development money that we can actually build in those comments rather than preempt them so I just need to get this into a beta functional state and then at that point get it tested yeah so anything that we subsequently do is done from the knowledge basis that we've had actually had it in the hands of users and they've tried and tested it and like it or don't like it as a case maybe and give us some feedback okay okay okay okay okay Continue to add features to it and spend money on that, not knowing whether or not foundational stuff that we've got already is of value to users and whether they'd be prepared to pay for it or not. Because, you know, this is a complete shot in the dark for me, the first thing I've ever built or had a hand in building in this space. And I've done training courses before, but they're kind of different things are very linear. So we could end up exploring all kinds of really cool stuff only to find that nobody wants it.

1:39:44 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Right. Yeah, that's that's a great point, because we need real user feedback like we can sit and think about it and iterate on it all day. But until that was when we started out together on this that I.

1:40:00 - Trevor Bradford (Brandvoice)
Continue to add features to it and spend money on that, not knowing whether or not foundational stuff that we've got already is of value to users and whether they'd be prepared to pay for it or not. Because, you know, this is a complete shot in the dark for me, the first thing I've ever built or had a hand in building in this space. And I've done training courses before, but they're kind of different things are very linear. So we could end up exploring all kinds of really cool stuff only to find that nobody wants it. Right. Yeah, that's that's a great point, because we need real user feedback like we can sit and think about it and iterate on it all day. But until that was when we started out together on this that I. I get something into beta, and that it was functional, it maybe wasn't perfect by any means, but was usable. I don't think it's quite there yet. I think some of these questions that I've got on the board, if we can answer those questions and provide either workarounds or just say, okay, well, we don't need that bit, then see where that gets us.

1:41:31 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
And then I'd like to test it as soon as possible. I'd like to give it to people to play with maybe over the Christmas holidays, when they're not focused on their own business maybe quite so much, and then get some feedback in the new year. I fully expect this will go to another phase, because I think I've not seen anything like this anywhere else. And I don't think Titan's AI is going to have anything like this. ... ... I don't see how they can have anything like this, though they may well have a general ask ChatGPT some questions about branding, but they've just got to get generic stuff back, not actually practical, implementable stuff. So, I mean, are you okay with that?

1:42:21 - Trevor Bradford (Brandvoice)
I think, yeah, I'm just trying to give you a good answer to that question because I think I'm not without before reviewing like our call and the ideas that we talked about. I think that potentially there's some red flags that are just like, okay, like we shouldn't do beta testing because we know that this is like, we need to fix this before. program. or... That's also ultimately up to you. So whatever, whenever, at what point you think it's ready for beta testing. I think we, it would be good to come up with a criteria. If you can come up with a criteria of like, what means it's ready for beta testing, then like, I can, I can do some more work and just get it across the line.

1:43:27 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
That would really help you. And, but then like, I think for me, Matt, the, the criteria that says it's ready for beta is that all the inputs end up on the same document. But for the end user, that's the point, the output at the end, the brand canvas, that it captures all of the inputs as they go.

1:43:50 - Trevor Bradford (Brandvoice)
And, and at the moment, it doesn't do that. Okay. So it was quite fragmented, you know, One bit, there's a bit, and then there's another bit over here that's not connected, and it puts the onus on the user to copy all the outputs that they get from it, put the document together themselves, and I don't think that's really sufficient for anybody to want to use this. So maybe I should just focus on that then, like get the output, pulling all the available context that they've put in, that they've chatted about with the brand coach, and kind of just make like a large, it might end up being a rather large document output, but I mean, it's only text, so it's not going to take up a whole lot of space on a computer. No, no, that's right. And I think that is the success criteria. If it does that, then it's ready for people to explore. very much. OK. And the other stuff, you know, adding videos and any development stuff that we discussed were really great ideas. I mean, they may well add value later, but the main value that I want to deliver is that people find this relatively straightforward to walk through and that their input can be captured.

1:45:30 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
And then everything they do is then all in one document at the back end. And then that for me is, that looks like a phase one success. You know, we've got something that we can then test. It may well be that I give you three or four more videos, say, for that. Thank you.

1:46:00 - Trevor Bradford (Brandvoice)
Initial page, because I think that initial page probably needs it, but they, they'll be short, and they'll be, I don't know, this whole collapsible thing, I wonder whether they should, at this stage, just be linked to Vimeo, and if people can watch the video, I don't want you doing loads and loads of extra work. I don't think that even making it collapsible will be a lot of extra work, and there's also the option to just use what we have with the embedded video, like on the Start Here page, and just leave the video there, I mean, it might not be the best user experience, if they would want to collapse it, but I don't see how it's really that bad to have video always there, but I think collapsible shouldn't even take that long. long. Okay, what I think we should definitely do for it to make sense is this page here and that one sort of conflate, don't they, in a way, if that sits up there above it. Does that make, so that that page and that page effectively are the, so the video ought to sit above the explanation of the framework. Right. Yep, okay. So it should sit there. are now. check So Okay, And then what follows will make sense after it's had at least some explanation. And then I'll start working on some other video content, and, you know, we can have a conversation about how well that works or not. But so then what we have here is we start with the brand diagnostic, as we agreed. That page. That's the same page, basically. So they have the option of downloading and signing up. If they sign up, then that brings them to this, which is the overview of the framework and the video. Then we go on to Avatar. Let's leave that for the moment, this page. were talking about getting rid of it, but I don't think we can.

1:48:56 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
So we'll leave it for the moment, and we may just.

1:49:00 - Trevor Bradford (Brandvoice)
I may ask you just to remove those inside components, but don't yet. Okay.

1:49:11 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Now the other stuff is minor stuff, you know, like buttons that ought to change color and bits and pieces and text frame formatting. Yeah, that was the thing I was looking for. That button that says Dood Avatar 2.0 is prompting me to do it when I've already done it. So if you would just look over this, this flow and just check the notes and make sure that anything that needs fixing needs fixing.

1:49:44 - Trevor Bradford (Brandvoice)
And then let's do let's ensure that everything's captured at the end of the in the single document. And then I'll run through it all again. When we've done that. Um, okay. And then decide. You know, whether or not that it's ready to go or it isn't. Yeah. So, OK, so like the individual things, like if I'm going to add a video, if I'm going to fix the export or just make sure that the export has all the data, that won't take that long. But if there's a bunch of little things that need to get fixed, then I think that that would sort of I can do it. But I'd rather I'd rather get paid to do like just get everything all together. But yeah, I think though, Matt, isn't that without the user feedback, the we don't know what works and what doesn't other than in our own opinion.

1:50:55 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
So let's just do the canvas thing. Yeah. Yeah. And as say, if you read through my notes, we answered some of these questions anyway, like the buttons and that kind of stuff. And just from a cleaning up point of view, be satisfied that this actually is a functioning app now, once the canvas is sorted, and then hand it over to me and I'll go through it. And then, you know, if we decide that we want to take it live, then I will.

1:51:31 - Trevor Bradford (Brandvoice)
And if I then decide that, well, okay, despite the fact that you've delivered what I asked you to deliver in terms of it delivering the document out of the back, it still needs more work.
ACTION ITEM: Send cleaned-up fixes list to Trevor; then implement - WATCH: https://fathom.video/share/pYiVp6htpj7WTtyt227kUtvc9cAk1gCb?timestamp=6700.9999 Then we can talk about what the brief for that work is. Okay.

1:51:47 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
That sounds good.

1:51:50 - Trevor Bradford (Brandvoice)
All right.

1:51:51 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Um, then yeah, I'll, I'll process this transcript and I'll, I'll, I'll go through this free form and I'll see you And I'll put together a list of sort of the things that I want to, I can just clean up and fix, and then I'll send that over to you before I do it. And just, we can just review that. That way, like, if there's anything you want me to pull in from the future roadmap, then we can at least discuss that before I start working. Because if I can just do it all in one session, then that would, that would be great. Okay. Matt, forgive me, I have to go because my, my client call is at four. So I need to get a glass of water. I'm feeling a bit hoarse. But thanks. That was a very useful session. As always, great working session. So I'll wait to hear from you. Okay, sounds good. Yeah, I'll let you go. All right. Thanks. You too. Bye bye. Thank you. Bye bye.
