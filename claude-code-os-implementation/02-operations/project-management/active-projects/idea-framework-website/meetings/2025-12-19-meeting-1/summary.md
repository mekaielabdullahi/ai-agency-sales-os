Meeting Purpose

Align on beta launch priorities and fix critical user experience issues.

Key Takeaways

- Beta Launch Blocked: The app is unusable for beta due to critical bugs: Brand Coach's memory is stuck on one project (e.g., "H4H skincare"), and data from Avatar 2.0 and Insights fails to save to the Brand Canvas.
- Multi-Brand Support: A brand selector dropdown will be built, enabling users to switch between projects. This is a key feature for consultants and entrepreneurs.
- Product Strategy: The app is a tool for the IDEA framework, bundled with a paid course to provide high-quality, actionable outputs. This model avoids competing on price with free software.
- Immediate Fixes: Matthew will fix the data-saving bug and remove the "start over" prompt from the Brand Canvas.

Topics

Beta Launch Readiness

- Goal: Launch a functional beta to avoid losing market share to new competitors.
- Problem: The current Lovable version has critical bugs preventing a launch.
  - Brand Coach Memory: Stuck on the "H4H skincare" project, ignoring new chat contexts.
  - Data Persistence: Data from Avatar 2.0 and Insights does not save to the Brand Canvas.
  - User Flow: The Brand Canvas repeatedly prompts users to "start over," disrupting the workflow.

Solution: Multi-Brand Support

- Root Cause: The app was built for a single-brand user, causing the Brand Coach to pull data from the only available project.
- Decision: Implement a brand selector dropdown in the top bar.
  - Rationale: This provides a clean, user-friendly way to manage multiple brands, mirroring familiar experiences like ChatGPT's chat history.
  - Interim Workaround: Until the feature is built, users can create separate accounts with different emails for each brand.

Product Strategy & Monetization

- Core Proposition: The app is a tool for the IDEA framework, not a standalone software product.
- Monetization Model:
  - Primary Offer: A paid course on the IDEA framework, with the app included as a practical tool for implementation.
  - Upsells: 1-on-1 coaching and a community membership.
- Value Proposition: The app's outputs are superior to generic GPTs because they are informed by the user's specific brand data, built within the app itself.
- Future Vision: A "to-do list" feature to guide users from strategic inputs (e.g., Brand Canvas) to tactical outputs (e.g., Amazon design brief).

UI Updates

- Matthew demoed local updates:
  - Brand avatar updated to "Avatar 2.0."
  - "Diagnostic" section removed from the top bar.
  - Collapsible video component implemented on the "Start Here" page.

Next Steps

- Matthew:
  - Fix the bug preventing Avatar 2.0 and Insights data from saving to the Brand Canvas.
  - Remove the "start over" prompt from the Brand Canvas.
- Trevor:
  - Clarify the scope and timeline for the multi-brand selector feature.
- Both: - Reconnect after the holiday break to review progress.
