## Full Transcript

Chris Andrade: 00:00
So this is the dealing with Mekaiel. Looks like we want to go over some. Ideas of how. The workflow would be for an onboarding process. So for instance, a discovery call or potential discovery call.

Toby: 25:00
Hey, what's up?

Chris Andrade: 25:02
Oh, just trying to capture a little bit more of the quad interface and all that good stuff. Just watching some YouTube videos and trying to clean up a little bit around the office.

Toby: 25:18
Okay, cool, cool. Yeah, I'm just getting some food right now.

Chris Andrade: 25:24
Oh, yeah?

Toby: 25:26
Yeah. Or just eating lasagna at home again. I had. I was checking out Suno because one of my other, like, group chats about chat GBT enthusiasts is like, they. Someone there like, made a. A song from something that was.

Chris Andrade: 25:51
Okay. I was so confused for a minute. Okay, gotcha.

Toby: 25:55
Okay. Yeah, it's. It's just like a song generator. So you can just. Dude, literally, like, a couple of prompts and like, I don't know what they do, but the songs, like, are like, kind of catchy. Like, sometimes it's a little bit cringe cringy, but it's like, could be like the lyrics and stuff, but as far as the melodies and everything, it's like.

Chris Andrade: 26:18
So you know what's really cool that I was looking for? And I actually reach out to a buddy of mine. He's an audio engineer. Oh, I actually need to say hi to him. They just had a huge breakthrough and you just reminded me that. Oh, yeah, hold on. Hey, buddy. O. Pal. Just checking in. How did your meeting go? Question mark. Anyways. Wait, was I going with this?

Toby: 27:04
They had a breakthrough or something and then like, Suno, like, creating songs.

Chris Andrade: 27:10
Oh. So SNS wolf sheds needed. I was trying to, like, this could be a part of our branding kit where we come up with the script to kind of come up with like a slogan or a scuffed song. Because I was about ready to drop 400 bucks on one of my buddy who was an audio engineer. He. And you know, I like that show where Charlie Sheen, he's like, makes melodies for a living.

Toby: 27:41
Right.

Chris Andrade: 27:42
That's what I was trying to do for sns. Like, come up with a melody for sns.

Toby: 27:48
Yeah, right.

Chris Andrade: 27:49
A slogan. And I was like, man. So now you mentioned that it would be a cool little feature to have, like, as like, a part of, like, a branding kit, you know, if the customer wants, which I know SNS would want, because again, we need to, like, try to capture that.

Toby: 28:09
Yeah.

Chris Andrade: 28:10
We still don't have a hook. I come up with a little guy. I have, like, this little guy who I would love to animate But SNS still doesn't have like a hook. Man, that is still. It's one of those things that I can't really find yet. You know what I'm saying?

Toby: 28:29
Okay. Have you like, worked with chat GBT on that idea?

Chris Andrade: 28:34
Like, honestly, not on that particular topic. Not like just straight up alone, Just analyzing if that's even an option. No. Okay. I mean, I'd be curious.

Toby: 28:52
Well, it makes Suno. Like makes things sound really good. I think it can. It seems like it's coming up with decent lyrics and like, you can. You can prompt back and forth with it, make it better. So.

Chris Andrade: 29:07
Hey, you know what, dude? Like, that could straight up be an offer. Like a quick win.

Toby: 29:14
For sns.

Chris Andrade: 29:15
Yeah.

Toby: 29:17
Wow. Straight up.

Chris Andrade: 29:20
Why not? It's. It could be a quick win. Like let's around like. Like that. Like that video Mel made for. Like that. Those slide show. That time he spent on that. Like, that's a quick win. We didn't think of it at the time, but like, in all reality, we're giving. That's a quick win.

Toby: 29:38
Yeah. I mean, all these little things.

Chris Andrade: 29:42
Yeah. I mean, like, like the insight, like the. The like when I did that market research for Kelsey, like, it opened up his eyes to like, what could possibly be. He never really thought about it, really, because it's never been presented to him, like, ultimately, you know.

Toby: 30:03
Yeah.

Chris Andrade: 30:06
Say that again.

Toby: 30:07
Nowadays these tools are so like crazy that it. It does so much just to try things out. Like, let's try it out. Why not? The worst that could happen, we lose 15 minutes.

Chris Andrade: 30:23
Right.

Toby: 30:24
And then the upside is like, we might be able to create something that they could use, you know? Yep.

Chris Andrade: 30:32
Hey, that's. That's like. That's.

Toby: 30:40
So.

Chris Andrade: 30:41
Did you read my statement that I want to. I'm putting. I put together for Mr. Mr. For Liam in the program.

Toby: 30:50
I haven't yet.

Chris Andrade: 30:52
Okay.

Toby: 30:56
I can read it right now.

Chris Andrade: 30:57
Yeah, I was gonna say take a minute because I'm just. I'm just working up. I'm waiting for Mekaiel. I think he said he was gonna jump in, but I think work came back in, which is no big deal, dude. Like, that's his. That's how he's getting paid right now. So do I. I'm just here passively getting ready.

Toby: 31:15
Got you. Yeah, I had a. I had a phone interview this morning, so I haven't the plotter mechanics stuff yet, but it's. It's really interesting if this company, it's like. I mean, it's only. It's 150 to 180,000 a year. So I think what we're doing would be, is definitely going to pay more eventually. Like and I definitely want to do this but like could be a band aid solution in the meantime. But they're doing like 3D modeling of the interiors of buildings. It's called Matterport.

Chris Andrade: 31:56
And wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Matterport?

Toby: 32:01
Yeah.

Chris Andrade: 32:02
Okay, I know Matterport very well. Continue.

Toby: 32:07
Okay. Yeah, so they, they just got bought out. Very warm connection referred me to the position. So we're gonna be, I think we're gonna be talking again in January. They said a lot of people are out because of the holidays right now. But their team is working on like basically being able to chat with like the interior of a like place. Right. Like a real estate, like either apartment, a house or like commercial size buildings. And they're also planning to work on like. And they didn't say anything about not repeating this information so but they're just saying like this is what you might be working on. So it's also the other one was get it like taking images. So they make, they make interior models of the, the, the apartment or the house with 2D images and they mesh them all together into like a 3D thing that is, creates like an immersive experience. Right.

Chris Andrade: 33:27
So Trent is gonna trip out the moment you. Once he hears it. You know why?

Toby: 33:38
What? No, I've been trying.

Chris Andrade: 33:41
So there's a part of construction that I'm tapping into currently that's a part of this takeoff process, right. That generates a 3D model of these construction sites using 3D Matterport Interface or whatever the wow. That ultimately gets sent to the stakeholders that they can wear a pair of goggles provided by the contractor to ultimately allow them to walk the job site from their office at any given time. Updated job site reports.

Toby: 34:23
Yeah.

Chris Andrade: 34:24
And then that same, that data to collect that image. Right. It's also used in the process to generate what we call in the industry as like they're called so takeoffs. And then when each process of the job as it moves forward through the sign offs from the city inspectors. Right. Once the sign off from the inspectors happen, then that initiates what's called as a. As built. The as built is the process of marking the location of the specific item that was referenced in that meeting during the inspection. Does that make sense?

Toby: 35:22
Wow. Yeah. Like in Company Cam it's like you can take notes on a specific piece, like a specific place. You're like looking at the thing. You point your phone.

Chris Andrade: 35:36
Matterport makes what's Called a total station. That total station is a two part device that has a central hub.

Toby: 35:52
Okay.

Chris Andrade: 35:53
That's referenced off of the. The geo referenced point which is usually like the stake. Right. That's the city ordinance. That's all referenced off of the same coordinate system. Right.

Toby: 36:10
And I'm sure I'm following that part. Can you say that part again?

Chris Andrade: 36:15
So when a surveyor walks up onto any job site.

Toby: 36:20
Right, Right.

Chris Andrade: 36:22
Because of how many coordinate systems are available. Right. They use the nearest stake, which there are a bunch of stakes surveyed states around. Right. That they use as a reference point.

Toby: 36:42
Right. Okay. So it's like a stake in the ground. It's like a receiver. Yeah.

Chris Andrade: 36:46
So they're using a specific set of. Of of geotags like a NATO 32 or I think Natum or Datum one of the two. It's all, it's all referenced. It go. This goes to my. When I'm collecting the drone data. Right. When they're creating the topos. Yeah. It was referring off of the coordinate system. Right.

Toby: 37:09
Anyways. Yeah.

Chris Andrade: 37:12
So this total station is referencing that geo tag or stake. Right. And then as it sits there on top has a two part component. It is a. There's a 3D scanner or a camera. Right. And then there is a tracker that keeps a lock on a prism located on what's called the rover. The. That's the. The unit that the technician is using to mark out those as builts along the process of the job. Does that make sense? So as he's walking through the job site, he has this stick like you've seen those surveyors walking around with them. Sticks.

Toby: 38:06
Yeah.

Chris Andrade: 38:08
And so the. At the total station is keeping track of that stick. And as he goes to the location of what was completed, he initiates a location. And that location is what is referred to as built.

Toby: 38:26
Okay. Okay. Yeah.

Chris Andrade: 38:28
That's all collected from the matterport world. That's what I try. Gives you all it comes to. And so yeah, so we were trying because of my drone and what I've been trying to do is create virtual reality components top for contractors to offer as an upsell to why you want to use us. And that's why our prices are so high. Because we're updating you live daily if you want.

Toby: 38:59
So because. So that your drone system is kind of like data collection.

Chris Andrade: 39:06
There's a drone which does the aerial, which does volume quick. But then for interior you have other components. They call it slam, which is a lidar, but it's a. So there's lidar, which is and then slam is a lidar, but on the ground like you're walking. And as you're walking, it's collecting the cloud point system.

Toby: 39:37
What's the cloud point system?

Chris Andrade: 39:39
The cloud point system is what, what your 3D Matterport is collecting and generating a 3D model. So the 3D model is built off of billions and billions of cloud points. That's the 3D model. And then the Matterport software is what converts that into a GEO again. So it's tying it to the GEO side of the software. So that's where Matterport. Dude. And they're the king dinglings.

Toby: 40:09
Yeah, yeah, they, yeah. And I guess they were bought out by Costar, which is the one that owns apartments.com and homes.com.

Chris Andrade: 40:23
See, that's news to me.

Toby: 40:26
That happened, they said it happened this year, eight, like eight months ago or something.

Chris Andrade: 40:32
Huh. Interesting. Interesting. Well, I don't know. I mean. So listen, man, I mean I say pursue what you got right now, right? Because ultimately we can outsource until we can't, you know, or when it doesn't make sense, you know what I'm saying?

Toby: 40:57
Yeah.

Chris Andrade: 40:58
And then ultimately that just keeps the coffers full, you know, where we can keep reinvesting and then pull when we need, you know?

Toby: 41:08
Yeah, they said. So they. The. My first conversation I had with, it's with someone who I worked with at Amazon. She just, she started working for Matterport like 2 months ago and she's the one who referred me.

Chris Andrade: 41:28
So.

Toby: 41:31
I was talking with her about it and she was like. Because I told her like on my resume there's Infinity Vault and then there's the other things that I've been working on. And so she was like, well, like COSTAR has this policy that like you can't work on stuff outside of, of work, so. Because it's like a salary thing.

Chris Andrade: 41:56
Right, right, right, right.

Toby: 41:58
And Amazon had the same thing. And like I really didn't like that because I want to, I want to work on more than one thing, you know, I don't think I'm as.

Chris Andrade: 42:06
Dude, there's, there has to be loops around and we're, we're using you as a consulting on like, I don't know, there has to be a loop around.

Toby: 42:19
So. But I was pushing back on that and just to be like, you know, like, I really, like, I was trying like to not close the door, you know. And I think that part worked because they gave me this follow up interview that I had today and they didn't even talk about that at all. Today it was more technical related somewhat and so, but I was pushing back and they said that they have a. Their policy is like, you can't do more than like eight hours outside of work. And I was like, oh well, eight hours a week isn't like I can still do something then. Yeah, yeah, that's a little better. I like that. Um, but I'm still like, you know, like I want to put everything to agency, so I'm trying to figure it out, but they, they're on holiday so they're. It's like end of next week when they're going to get back in contact with me.

Chris Andrade: 43:17
Dude, listen, I, I have a feeling that things are going to work out, but right now security is everything. And then like, like I feel that because you're getting good money and because I still haven't had really any income yet, you can like, it will help out. Like, like it. And I get a little withdrawal, you know what I'm saying?

Toby: 43:48
Yeah, yeah.

Chris Andrade: 43:50
And I think if we approach it like that, I feel like it's a smart gameplay to keep the ultimate everything going down the same road, you know?

Toby: 44:01
Yeah. It's like just securing that money in. Right.

Chris Andrade: 44:09
Right.

Toby: 44:13
It also builds my resume more and opens the door for other things. So.

Chris Andrade: 44:21
And dude, if we do not get selected for this beta program.

Toby: 44:29
You must.

Chris Andrade: 44:29
Be like, I can't. I would love to see what other competition, like what's the other situations, like what are we missing?

Toby: 44:38
Yeah. You know what I'm saying? I'm. I'm actually. Yeah, I do know exactly what you're saying. And I'm like, I'm kind of flabbergasted that more people aren't teaming up. Like maybe the, the only way I can see is that there's like teams that have been delivering of like five to 10 people, like 20 of them.

Chris Andrade: 45:00
But like trying to chime in on man. This is what I'm trying to say is that we have a secret sauce, a component that's. We're leveraging. And this is where I talk about frequencies. Right. Because there's no other way to describe it. And I'm a big like Nikola. Right. Tesla and understanding energy and frequencies. And really, if you really, really, really, really, really. We're boiling it down. The whole world operates on a frequency regardless of whatever, whatever you, whatever your standpoint on life is in general. There's no argument that you. That can be made about that. Right.

Toby: 45:42
Yeah.

Chris Andrade: 45:42
And sometimes I feel that some people just have this tune that they're naturally built with. Right. This heart. And you can pick up other tuners, you know what I mean? Like, they're called eaters. Like, I don't know how if you're into the game, like this part of the survival stuff, right? Like ham radios, right?

Toby: 46:07
My dad was super into ham radios. His dad? Yeah, his dad. And his dad, like, it broke. And then his dad always kind of like his dad had a lot of kids. So my dad was kind of like one of the less favorites is what he would always tell us. And he always thought he was kind of dumb or something. And then he like fixed his dad's ham radio and he was just like, yeah, it works now it's like his dad was like struggling with it and like couldn't figure it out. So.

Chris Andrade: 46:38
So I'm just gonna say like the Polymath Guild, right, is looking for somebody like that just knows because eventually, listen, like the plan is some, like somebody's gonna need to have something like that.

Toby: 46:58
And.

Chris Andrade: 46:59
And I don't know enough that, that. But I know that there's ways that people can sell kits and like build kits and like just design kits, right? And. And so like I have a guy who's doing like solar kits and turning our sheds into these little battery power kids, dude. And all he does is just sell you a kit and installs it, warranties it. And then now you have a little 6 by 12 solar generator that can survive three months solid.

Toby: 47:33
Yeah, yeah.

Chris Andrade: 47:34
Like, it's crazy little like that. You know what I mean?

Toby: 47:37
That's so cool. I would. Yeah, I would love to have one of those someday.

Chris Andrade: 47:40
Yeah, no, listen, bro, I got you. This is, this is the plan. But like what I'm trying to say eventually, like when you can talk to your dad about. Which would be really cool because I feel like he's already kind of involved with how, you know, just the natural flow of things. You can kind of talk to him about it. Yeah, yeah. So we're talking and Chris was saying about, you know, because we're kind of getting an idea of what Mekaiel was touching on is like our specialty, right? Or like what we're good at, you know, And a lot of that comes from my background as just a general. Not just a survivalist, but you know, a horticulturist. Like a self. Like the self sustainable practices, dude. And at the end of the day, I just love to learn how to control water. Especially here in the desert. That's. That's our everything.

Toby: 48:35
Yeah. That's so cool, right?

Chris Andrade: 48:40
Yeah. And. And that's. That's ultimately how this all started, dude, like. And yeah, so that's why, again, this whole Liam story, I just don't understand why he, like, once he sees all four of us teaming up. Right.

Toby: 48:56
Yeah.

Chris Andrade: 48:57
And if people aren't doing contests to that, what we're about. And I think what Liam is about too, because I think a little bit, he's gonna see a little bit of similarities of how him and Nick started, you know?

Toby: 49:14
Yeah.

Chris Andrade: 49:16
He saw what was AI when it came out three years ago, and he's like, oh, oh, people need to learn how to use this.

Toby: 49:25
Oh, that's where for sure he's on, like, another level. And he's been, he got here, like, way before us.

Chris Andrade: 49:33
So right now, look at what Claude just did. Right. And now we have a whole other component to AI that didn't exist three years. And now here we were like, oh, right.

Toby: 49:49
And we're getting into it.

Chris Andrade: 49:52
We can, we can use this. We can, we can build people's own cloud environments and, and then teach people how to use their own environments to make their companies even better than we could ever even imagine.

Toby: 50:04
Yeah, dude. And, like, what's the deal with Darren leaving? Like, do you think he left? Like, if he left and we just start doing that, what he was doing? Like, who? I don't know. The guy who created the Claude Code OS video, the YouTube.

Chris Andrade: 50:24
I don't know who. I don't. Yeah, I, I. What's the backstory there? I'm not sure. I'm not familiar.

Toby: 50:29
Yeah, you gotta. Well, have you started watching that YouTube video I sent you? The 33?

Chris Andrade: 50:34
Yeah, no, I, I was watching it and I was working through it, but then Mekaiel kind of hopped on, so I kind of got here. It was gaining up for that.

Toby: 50:45
So that's the guy who. I'm talking about. His. He's Darren. He was a coach in the community. All right. He might still be, but we were just looking yesterday at the coaching calls that we can set up. And, like, his name isn't there right now, but I think someone had a call. I think Mekaiel had a call with him. Like a coaching call with him.

Chris Andrade: 51:06
What? Okay. Okay.

Toby: 51:09
Yeah. Talking about this idea, by the way, like, packaging, selling it like a cloud code OS to businesses.

Chris Andrade: 51:19
Oh, gotcha.

Toby: 51:20
And.

Chris Andrade: 51:21
And what was his perception?

Toby: 51:24
You have to ask Mekaiel. I kind of, I kind of forgot. I don't think I got too many details, but I think he said, like, it was like, yeah, it's a good idea, but there was some sort of reservation or something. I don't Remember? But interesting.

Chris Andrade: 51:39
I'd be really curious to see how that. So this is another thing that's coming up Matt, is like our databases, our conversations and how does that look? Is there a way that we can just have. Just build a central hub location for us to point all our firefly to. To where then we could automatically run the scripts.

Toby: 52:06
So like instead of me building one.

Chris Andrade: 52:08
Here and Mekaiel building one there, you building one there, what if we created a central drive that we just upload the files to each client that is referenced to all. Like that would initiate a trigger to run an automatic script of a voice transcription or whatever.

Toby: 52:31
So like when you're saying that I'm imagining a Google Drive folder, right. And every time one of us has a meeting on like Fireflies or Fathom, there's an automation that runs that picks that up. It's like oh like you know, a meeting just happened. Right. Let's run this automation. Let's call the API, pull the transcript. Let's get the transcript in one document. But it's going to have to process and identify like.

Chris Andrade: 53:06
Like all along the drive. If there's a way to structure it where we pre select. Okay, this is a meeting. This is what the new client or existing client, you know what I'm saying? And it only two or three selections.

Toby: 53:21
Wait, what are you saying?

Chris Andrade: 53:24
We redesignate that audio file to a designated either folder for now of a category of like a new client.

Toby: 53:37
How would that look like, like we would create a folder ourselves for a new client?

Chris Andrade: 53:43
No, like we'll have like the way I would. The way I do it on my like for my company. Right. Is I have a central like my. Our central Remus development hub that has all of our clients information. So everybody points to that hub to put information, permits, plans, takeoffs, whatever the to right. From every. And then from there it has a different segregated folder for whatever information that pertains. Right. So we use that methodology and use. Okay, so arise group. Right. And then. And then, and then we'll have just a designated folder for recordings. Right? Right.

Toby: 54:31
Yep.

Chris Andrade: 54:32
And then in the recordings folder it was going to say is this recording for meetings? Is this a cult folder like a new client, an existing client.

Toby: 54:41
Right.

Chris Andrade: 54:42
And then from there we designate which client. And then from there whatever three out of whatever folder or whatever gets initiated. That's new. Can it be a trigger to initiate some sort of response for something to happen down the line?

Toby: 55:02
Yeah. Okay, so like we can, we can. Because what I'm thinking is like the recordings will happen so where are the manual steps and where are the steps we can, we should automate? Like, because we can quickly, we can easily, like, I don't know, I'm trying to think, is it, is it going to be easy to automate, like, categorizing and like, setting up the organization and adapting the organization as it goes. Like, okay, meeting structure. Like, client number one meeting on this date. Like, we want to have dated meetings. I think there's like a folder with today's date if we have a meeting today. And then inside that folder is like a meeting meeting folder. And then inside that one is like files for the audio recording, the summary and the transcript.

Chris Andrade: 56:00
Right, Right.

Toby: 56:03
So we don't want to do the work of like copying and pasting the summary and the transcript and downloading the video file and uploading that to Google Drive, but we can do, at first, we can do the organization of like, being like, oh, we got a new client, let's create a new folder right here and then run the automation and then the automation so we, we can enable the automation for this new client. Right. So imagine like anytime we have a new Fireflies recording pop up in your, in your site or newer Fireflies, then that meeting gets processed and it just tries to identify which client of the current clients is this meeting related to. And then there's like, and then it'll maybe it just uploads it there and then it'll tell us, ideally it'll tell us what it did in a weekly report and it'll, it'll send an email to, like, you if you own that Fireflies account, it'll send you an email and it'll say, this week I put this link Fireflies in this client folder, this one in this client folder. So at the end of the week, you can just take 5 minutes and click through each one and be like, oh, yeah, that's the right one. All right.

Chris Andrade: 57:33
Like a validation process or whatever.

Toby: 57:35
Yeah, yeah, I think they're good.

Chris Andrade: 57:40
Listen, I, I think whatever we start off with, man, will help no matter which way shape form and then it will ultimately build itself out.

Toby: 57:52
Yeah, like right now, this is a problem that we're having. So, like, it's the first, it's like one of the first problems that we're having with all this data coming in of like, all this valuable data of like, things that we need to build our company. So we need to get something like, that's our job.

Chris Andrade: 58:11
I, I, I, I been like yesterday with what we did, expose some weaknesses, and I think we should use that and leverage that as an opportunity for us to get revenue in the door. Because what I'm thinking here is I'm doing it like. Like you, like, straight up. Because of the situation with sns, you guys are now running me through the business. Right. So honestly, what you did yesterday. Let me turn my camera on here. What? Right.

Toby: 58:56
Okay.

Chris Andrade: 58:57
Allowed me to understand the business at a different rate. Right, Right. Because now I'm understanding, oh, we got. I get to see things on a. On. On a analytic side versus just a login. Now I'm understanding the things a little differently. Right.

Toby: 59:27
Yeah.

Chris Andrade: 59:27
And now I'm realizing that we can use that for Kelsey and other people, like, at the end of the day.

Toby: 59:36
Yeah.

Chris Andrade: 59:37
And. And. And now I'm wondering, well, if we use what we're doing right now. So what is this? I'm doing some research is what I'm trying to get at. And I'm realizing that there is this. Do you know who Eric Heck is?

Toby: 59:57
Dude, I just. I was telling him for the first time on my YouTube today about.

Chris Andrade: 01:00:05
Claude Skill.

Toby: 01:00:07
Yeah. That's the video I saw.

Chris Andrade: 01:00:09
And what I'm seeing here is that he developed a pipeline of interface through cloud that ultimately collaborates simultaneously. It's like a shared work desk. This is what I was listening to when this meeting started. And I just let it play, honestly, to kind of go through the. The notes because I got firefly. I was waiting for Mikel, and I'm just doing around the house or the office. I was like, well, let me just let this play for the script to pick up.

Toby: 01:00:47
Okay.

Chris Andrade: 01:00:49
I'm hearing what. Because I'm trying to understand the cloud a little better. Right. And now doing some research and I'm seeing, like, these new videos because everything's still new that are like a month old. This guy just. This video is just released seven hours ago.

Toby: 01:01:07
Yeah. So that's one of the potential solutions that we were thinking that Kelsey could do. Like, right now is like, we set up a skill, a clawed skill for him.

Chris Andrade: 01:01:19
Right. And that's what in that. In, like, if there's a way for. So this is something that I'd be. I gotta turn this camera off, dude. This thing pisses me off. If there's a way to, like. I was curious to see what your thoughts were here. And if I'm thinking too vast and broad, I apologize. But because of, like, those tokens and those requests that I was running through yesterday. Right, right. And what we are capable of, who's to say that we can't custom build an internal computer that we custom built for plotter mechanics. Right. That integrate easily. Like if it was just another computer in the office, but it's our key into their system and it has the. It has their cloud environment already built, ready to roll with everything looking all nice. Right. And I go just plug this thing in and then just leave this desktop in the middle of the. The station. Right. Somewhere. And then it could be referenced like our. As like the hub that we were talking about.

Toby: 01:02:39
Right, right.

Chris Andrade: 01:02:43
We can use that to interface with the cloud environment. Like it would eliminate us having to go through and sit at his computer and upload this, take this laptop for a couple weeks. No, no, no. Let us build you a computer. Build everything we need to integrate right into your office that just connect to the WI fi and boom, we're locked in.

Toby: 01:03:08
Like a, like a turnkey. Here's your AI computer.

Chris Andrade: 01:03:13
Yeah, exactly. Like a straight up, just internal desktop server, whatever we want to call it. Right?

Toby: 01:03:24
Yeah. I love.

Chris Andrade: 01:03:25
Like, like, then we could even ship them with one of these Insta360 cameras that plug it right in and it just mounted up on a 15 foot pole. And now we just created this security system right in the middle of the office. And then we can use the Insta360 camera to talk and interface. Like. Hey, Kelsey, not. Yeah, yeah, that tool's behind you. Yeah, yeah. You can ultimately use it to interact with it. Like, you know what I'm saying?

Toby: 01:03:58
Yeah.

Chris Andrade: 01:03:58
Like eventually the plan would be to create that hub inside that office. So as they talk and share information vocally, that thing's tracking it, ready to go, sending off shit, allowing things to get approved, invoice to get created, inventories to be sent and built and compiled and get ready for tomorrow or whatever, you know?

Toby: 01:04:25
Yeah, but I don't.

Chris Andrade: 01:04:27
Is that too far fetched to say?

Toby: 01:04:29
That reminds me of this. I just started watching this, like in Solution Sorcery, there's a video that, where Liam talks about like AI agent future. And it's like a short three minute clip of like this guy walking on the beach, right? And he has. It's like the future vision of how AI agents are going to be incorporated into our lives. And it's like he's walking on the beach, he has these goggles on, and in the goggles he gets a text from his wife and she's like, oh, like our kid just filled a bottle of wine on the floor. Can you, can you get. Can you get a carpet cleaner? And let's not get, you know, overcharged like Last time or something. And then he, like, it goes like slow motion mode, and it's like he's walking his dog on the beach and he gets the text. And then I think he sends off a request to his AI assistant, Amanda, and just basically tells her what he's looking for as a response to his wife text. And then he like, throws the ball to the. To the dog running. And then by the time the dog comes back, it's like, boom. Like carpet cleaners. And one of them's 120 bucks, and one of them is 140 bucks. And she's like, which one do you want? Like, the 120 has 3.5 stars, but the 140 has 4.5. And he's like, let's go with the cheaper one. And then, boom, she sent it off. And then he, like, ties up his dog to go inside a cafe, and by the time he's waiting in line, it's like, boom. It's already been booked, like, for this Wednesday.

Chris Andrade: 01:06:29
This is what I'm trying to say. And, like, imagine if I know Kelsey would say, wait, you're telling me I. You're gonna custom build me a computer that is my own AI bot, so as soon as I walk into this office, it's going to recognize my phone, possibly already automatically download my shit. And then also I can just plug in all my devices and it would automatically download all my. And all I would have to do is pay, let's just say, five grand for this computer. And then now I got an extra security system that's, you know. Yes, it's in the system, but we can get. We. I'm sure there's another way to, like, provide an extra power source if something happened or whatever. Whatever. You know what I mean? Like, there's things that can be modified if you want, you know, but ultimately, if you want to plug cameras into this thing, you can. Microphones, this thing, you can, like, talk to it. And then this is how your cloud system works. And like, how, like, we can push all of the information directly to his system, then that can be uploaded and improved to. To the network system. You know what I'm saying?

Toby: 01:07:45
Yeah, I think so. I love this idea and I love that we have it documented, and I think it's definitely a vision, and I'm just not sure how soon we can make it happen.

Chris Andrade: 01:07:59
Oh, no, but. Right, it's the. This is what Gliam's like, when. When. If we ever talk to Liam.

Toby: 01:08:08
Yeah.

Chris Andrade: 01:08:10
And I'm sure he's had these Thoughts himself. Right. All I'm trying to say is we see a vision, we are in touch with reality, we understand what capabilities things are. But this is something that we definitely could implement if available.

Toby: 01:08:32
Yeah. And it just becomes an engineering problem. Like, how do we.

Chris Andrade: 01:08:36
Exactly. It's just a cool problem to have because I know for a fact Kelsey for Quadrant mechanics would buy it.

Toby: 01:08:44
Wow. Yeah. Because the connecting stuff part is probably the first step of like. And it's also kind of like, okay, why. Why do we need a separate computer rather than just connecting the ones that they have? If it's because maybe it requires more computing power.

Chris Andrade: 01:09:09
Right.

Toby: 01:09:10
But I'm not sure if that's actually really the case. So we would want to verify that before, like, building a separate.

Chris Andrade: 01:09:18
The reason why I would say is a. It's an upsell period. Like, boil it down. Boil all, Boil it down. It's an upsell. Right. I. But I think it's worth the opportunity to upsell because we are eliminating user error and providing just simplicity.

Toby: 01:09:41
Right.

Chris Andrade: 01:09:41
There's no network configuration, login issues, password resets, the nine, you know, like completely done for you through the plugin, put in the WI fi password, or connect the Ethernet preferably, and boom, done.

Toby: 01:10:02
Yeah, it's all connected.

Chris Andrade: 01:10:04
The thing is, that's all I'm saying is, like, some people would pay for that.

Toby: 01:10:08
Yeah, for sure. And especially companies that want to keep their data on premises exact.

Chris Andrade: 01:10:17
Exact. And it segments us from the system, ultimately giving them control at the end of the day because they can put it in behind their firewalls and approve us through that access point or whatever. I mean, listen, at the end of the day, the possibilities are endless. You know what I mean? At the end of the day, it just gives us a direct key to any interface possible and it eliminates a customer having to deal with a bunch of bullshit. And we can build a computer for cheap, bro. Like, we can straight up. We can even just use it to build an Arduino or a Raspberry PI if it needed it. But we can charge a thousand bucks for it. At the end of the day, that's all it is, an Arduino. It's just a little mini computer and then processing power.

Toby: 01:11:12
Yeah, but the. The Llama, the open source models would need some level of process processing power if we want all the data on.

Chris Andrade: 01:11:20
This is cool. Hold on. Toby, my guy, what is up?

Toby: 01:11:27
Sorry, I'm still like, unloading and doing inventory and trying to eat and just get caught up, you know?

Chris Andrade: 01:11:33
So did you guys have a Good day? Far behind.

Toby: 01:11:37
Yeah. Yeah, it was. It was a chill trip. We. We got super late, but it worked out because we. We stopped at this, like, it's like, Japanese market, I guess. It's the largest in the U.S. and we.

Chris Andrade: 01:11:55
Where is it at?

Toby: 01:11:55
Food San Diego.

Chris Andrade: 01:11:57
What part?

Toby: 01:12:00
Dude, I'd have to check. It's right by Convoy and Balboa. I don't know what the neighborhood's called.

Chris Andrade: 01:12:07
Okay, okay. But biggest.

Toby: 01:12:08
Japanese.

Chris Andrade: 01:12:09
Japanese. Yeah.

Toby: 01:12:11
So they just do a lot of, like, import food goods and stuff. So they have, like, an actual grocery store with, like, fresh and frozen stuff, and then they have, like, a dry goods store with all, like, the ingredients and stuff. And then they have, like, a home goods store with, like, toys and. Toys and home stuff, you know?

Chris Andrade: 01:12:29
Yeah, like, you would see straight up in, like, a market.

Toby: 01:12:33
Yeah, yeah. So it's pretty cool. But we ended up, like, cruising through there for a while, and then we ate eight. And so we got out of there super late, but we completely missed the traffic. So even though we spent, like, two hours there chilling, we only got back an hour later than normal, so.

Chris Andrade: 01:12:50
Nice.

Toby: 01:12:51
Yeah, we skipped the traffic, so it's kind of cool.

Chris Andrade: 01:12:54
So it's, like, definitely worth that extra hour.

Toby: 01:12:56
Oh, yeah, yeah. Because otherwise you're just sitting in the car miserable, you know, so it might as well be doing fun stuff. So.

Chris Andrade: 01:13:02
Yeah. So what are you doing now? Are you busy right now or you got. You think you're unloading? Patience.

Toby: 01:13:08
Yeah, so I unloaded. I'm basically stocking everything right now and. And uploading all the inventory. But, like, I'm taking a food break right now, so.

Chris Andrade: 01:13:18
So all the snowbirds coming back or what?

Toby: 01:13:22
Yeah, they're. They're mostly all back, but it's like, they're not really. They're not really our clients, you know, they just. They just bring money into the economy, so. Yeah, you know, they're all their travelers, and they'll. They'll come in and they'll be like, oh, I'm not. Not buying any plants. I'm in an rv and like, okay, I don't care.

Chris Andrade: 01:13:42
But interesting.

Toby: 01:13:44
Like I said, they just bring money into the. To the economy, so. Right.

Chris Andrade: 01:13:49
Not when. At the end of the day. That's what you need, right?

Toby: 01:13:53
Yeah. Because if everyone else is making money, then they're spending more money, you know, so it works out well.

Chris Andrade: 01:14:00
How is. How's. I got distracted here. Why is. Firefighting. Are you. How. What's your schedule like? Coming up?

Toby: 01:14:20
A screenshot of my calendar.

Chris Andrade: 01:14:22
Yeah.

Toby: 01:14:23
And that'll give you a good heads up. Let's see. Yeah, I'll screenshot my calendar and send it over to you. My, my days that I work are the green days on the calendar.

Chris Andrade: 01:14:35
Okay.

Toby: 01:14:36
So as long as you know that, basically then you're good to go. Then the other days too, you know, I might be working at the shop, but that doesn't matter. So.

Chris Andrade: 01:14:45
Well, hey, do you. Can I ask you some quick five questions real quick that would help expedite the process? Yeah.

Toby: 01:14:52
What's up?

Chris Andrade: 01:14:53
Okay, so what is the biggest problem in your business right now?

Toby: 01:15:01
I think getting customers.

Chris Andrade: 01:15:06
Like marketing and ads and stuff.

Toby: 01:15:09
Yeah, yeah, yeah. So like every day while I'm at the shop, we'll have people walk through the building and they'll be like, oh my God, I didn't know this building existed. You know, and they'll come into the shop and like be like, holy. How long have you been here? You know, every single day. I hear that. So. So like, because we're in Oldtown Yuma, right? Like downtown and it used to be dead here. It's a ghost town, except maybe in the winter time because there's a couple restaurants and stuff. But now there's restaurants, there's bars, there's shops. It's kind of coming back to life. It's. It's kind of like the up and cominging place right now. And you just still so many people that have lived here forever. Forever that don't know our building exists, so.

Chris Andrade: 01:15:50
And you just expanded because you got the spot next door, right?

Toby: 01:15:54
Yeah, so we, we were in the middle of the building and then the front two units moved out and they took out a wall. So we made two units in one big one. And then we're right up at the front window now.

Chris Andrade: 01:16:09
So just getting your name out there and how many followers are you gotten on your Insta and how active are you there on there?

Toby: 01:16:18 2600. We were, we were right at like 2000 in or 22 or something like that. And I started doing some paid ad campaigns where I posted some cool pictures and stuff. Like, like nice looking.

Chris Andrade: 01:16:31
How much did you spend?

Toby: 01:16:34
Maybe all together? 250 bucks. And I'm at like 2600 followers.

Chris Andrade: 01:16:39
You know how much and how big of a Spanish.

Toby: 01:16:43
How long? Yeah, we ran out for two and a half weeks, three weeks total.

Chris Andrade: 01:16:48
Okay. Okay.

Toby: 01:16:49
Yeah.

Chris Andrade: 01:16:50
Okay. And do you, Are you more active on Facebook or Instagram?

Toby: 01:16:59
Instagram. Post to Instagram and also post to my Facebook, so.

Chris Andrade: 01:17:05
Gotcha. And are you having any. Anything that help you expedite the process of posting and creating?

Toby: 01:17:15
No, not really. I kind of do everything myself. I'm getting a little bit better at it now that, you know, I'm using a little bit of AI stuff because it's a lot easier to make stuff now, you know, so before I was having to get in like Canva and make myself and whatever, and now I'm like, hey, make me a flyer with this picture and doing this and whatever. And it's usually pretty, pretty good. You know, it might take me 15 minutes to fill in with it, but it's pretty good. So I've been posting more stuff and that's been helping. So.

Chris Andrade: 01:17:46
And who are, and what are you using? What platform?

Toby: 01:17:51
Chat GBD the 20amonth.

Chris Andrade: 01:17:54
Okay. Do you have a tick tock?

Toby: 01:17:57
No, I don't.

Chris Andrade: 01:17:59
Okay, gotcha. Gotcha. I mean, so I, I know. So backstory on you is like, ultimately how this all started was the hemp business and me and you were brainstorming because the business was going slow. And that's when I was like, man, we need to start selling plants. And that's when ultimately you started, right? And then like you got your, your certificate for the Asian do that's still current for what? Tell me about that.

Toby: 01:18:29
I still, I still have my, my import license. So I don't, I don't remember. It's like the aphis. APHIS license or something like that. But so basically it's just a federal license you have to get. Anyone can get one, but you just apply for it and basically you can import plants from people who have their export license. And. Yeah, so I've done, I haven't done that many, but I've probably done like half a dozen import orders. Cool thing is, we're planning a trip. We're going to, we're going to Thailand and Vietnam in April and we're gonna go meet up with, with some greenhouse over there, like a few, and tour some facilities, meet some new contacts.

Chris Andrade: 01:19:24
So. Yeah, I gotta introduce you to Chip, my buddy Chip. He's actually the guy who's training me every week. His wife is from there. Yeah. And so they're actually even thinking about buying a spot out there because that's.

Toby: 01:19:41
What her family is like. You know, if it wasn't for her being opposed, you know, I would be probably willing to sell everything and move over there and then just do like the export business. Thank you. Bye.

Chris Andrade: 01:19:57
Well, hey man, listen, listen, we. Yeah, yeah, that's ultimately establishing a hub down here. This is where I'm trying to get You, Toby. And so real quick, on the Florida deal, did you ever establish that quarantine zone?

Toby: 01:20:10
No, I still can. I just haven't pursued it because I found other suppliers that already have their license. So the only reason I had to do do the quarantine thing was because this particular plant place didn't have the permits. So if they have an expert export permit for Arizona, then I don't need that permit. So I just found other suppliers that already had it because plenty of them all over the U.S. but Arizona makes them have a certain permit basically like a fire ant quarantine. So. And I guess they do enough business without Arizona to where they just don't bother with it. So.

Chris Andrade: 01:20:49
Gotcha. Gotcha.

Toby: 01:20:51
Yeah, so I found, I found a couple other smaller companies that have way more rare and exotic stuff. Anyway, they're, they're smaller starter plants so generally they're going to be like a 3 to 4 inch pot size, but that keeps my price point down and then it keeps the sale price point down. So you know, because if it was an established 6 inch plants, what I pay 25 bucks for right now and sell for 75, it might cost me 150 and then it would be very hard to sell.

Chris Andrade: 01:21:24
Gotcha, gotcha. That makes sense. And when you're tracking your systems in all your sales, what are you using again? Oh no, you're good, you're good. I was just asking what are you using to track your systems? And you're see like your CRM and stuff.

Toby: 01:21:47
Like my, like my TLS system.

Chris Andrade: 01:21:49
Yeah.

Toby: 01:21:51
So we go everything through square.

Chris Andrade: 01:21:54
Okay.

Toby: 01:21:55
Which I like it functions well, I just don't like, you know, they're all trying to take their piece. They're 3%. But I do like the convenience factor and then I like that's.

Chris Andrade: 01:22:07
And is that how you keep track of all your customers? Like where all your information for your customers live?

Toby: 01:22:14
Yeah, I think so, yeah. I mean it'll collect certain things, you know.

Chris Andrade: 01:22:18
And do you have any like Google data or Google Drives or anything like that of proprietary information or anything like that that you can source yourself? Like, like this is what Maples Apothecary has built or made or sustained.

Toby: 01:22:32
I'm not really sure entirely what you mean.

Chris Andrade: 01:22:35
Like a knowledge base. Like your own knowledge base. Like you have your own set of documents that you worked on. I know you have like remember how you. I guess I'm referring to like those programs for instance that you did for, to generate revenue or like awareness. You were giving away plants, right. And you had that Program and then the one that you did about the training where you're showing people how to plot transfer. Those client classes that were selling out really good, like, like that kind of stuff. Like do you have like, kind of like information put away somewhere?

Toby: 01:23:13
I have like templates for my plant classes and you know, little stuff like that, but not like, not a ton of that stuff. You know, I've been having a few, a few more curriculums.

Chris Andrade: 01:23:28
Nice, nice. Right, right, right.

Toby: 01:23:34
Mushroom growing class. Just little easy signals each, you know, because that's all profit.

Chris Andrade: 01:23:39
So do you remember like how I brought in Hunt, right. The horticulturist out of Oregon. Right. And we're talking about the mushrooms, right. And how to like turn mushrooms into sales. Anyways, what we were doing with robotics and like that data behind the plant's ability to sweat and monitoring that. Right. And that's how we know how much to water a plant right at the end of the day. So that kind of information is. What I, I was referring to with you is like you have all that kind of stuff, stuff that, that I would be really curious on how you can create your own little knowledge base that people can reference, you know, but.

Toby: 01:24:26
It'S too hard. There's too many variations or too, too many variables, you know, Like, I don't.

Chris Andrade: 01:24:32
Well, I will. You know what's cool is that this will kind of just happen on its own. But more importantly, it's like, how are you keeping track of your customers that you're, that you're selling? Is it just all through square and like that you don't have any like email outreach programs or any like, marketing things? Okay, okay, gotcha. Well, damn. So and if, because you don't have a way to like keep track your customers and reach your customers or like you have your, you know, people don't know who, where you are at. Like how much do you think that's costing you per month? Well, if there, if there was no budget, if nobody, if you had all the budget in the world, like you, you know, reality, like just. It doesn't have to be a precise number. Just.

Toby: 01:25:22
Yeah.

Chris Andrade: 01:25:23
What do you think that is?

Toby: 01:25:26
I don't know. So I, I know the plant market in general is huge and you know, there's a real big like support local.

Chris Andrade: 01:25:36
Movement right now, especially with what you got with Yuma and how long you've been there.

Toby: 01:25:41
Yeah, there's, there's plenty, plenty, plenty of people that would buy from me rather than Home Depot or Lowe's, if they know I exist. You know, and that's the thing. I think get my ad in front of everyone in Yuma, I could turn this into a legitimate career. And that's the thing. Right? So right now, you know, with the, with a trip to Thailand, getting new suppliers, I've got my, My niece's boyfriend, he's gonna start volunteering here. I. I told him, I was like, hey, he's really, really, really into, like horticulture, like growing fruit trees and stuff like that.

Chris Andrade: 01:26:20
Nice.

Toby: 01:26:21
More sciency stuff. So, yeah, I told him. I was like, hey, man, I've got, I've got some projects here. If you can volunteer for a while until these things get rolled only. And then once they start bringing in revenue, I'll bring you on, you know, if you want to do part time or whatever, there's a spot for you, you know? And he's like. Immediately, he's like, yes, absolutely, I'll do it. He's super into all that stuff, so. But I think I'm gonna have him help me out, set up a bunch of like, my, my grow tents down the. The basement, get that stuff all situated and professional.

Chris Andrade: 01:26:55
Have you locked that space down there in the basement?

Toby: 01:26:58
So I'm sitting down here right now, eating lunch.

Chris Andrade: 01:27:01
Nice.

Toby: 01:27:02
I have, I have my space down here, and she's not even charging me for it. They. They were trying to rent it out. I guess some people were trying to do like a, like a comedy club down here because it's huge. Yeah, probably. If I had to guess, it's probably 5,000, 6,000 square foot. But it's not really feasible for a business because the building is pre ADA compliance. So the staircase, there's. There's two stairwells. They're both at one end of the building near each other. They're extremely steep. There's no wheelchair access. There's no elevator. There's no, like. It would be a nightmare to get this place set up for a legitimate business. But I would almost guarantee, if I had a business plan and whatever, I could say, hey, give me the whole entire basement for a thousand bucks a month. And they would probably just do it. I'd say, hey, I don't, I don't need air conditioning. I might need a tiny bit extra electricity. But nothing crazy because I'm not growing cannabis. You know, these plants don't really need a ton of light. A little bit. A little bit of LED goes a long way for these guys.

Chris Andrade: 01:28:09
Right.

Toby: 01:28:10
I could have winter, all winter through summer. I have the perfect environment down here. And yeah, I would just be a Production powerhouse down here.

Chris Andrade: 01:28:21
So what you're telling me is you had. If you had the ability to produce, like, some sort of business plan to show an ROI on an idea on, like, a minimum scale. Right. To prove your concept, you think that she would be able to be like, damn, I can turn something into nothing?

Toby: 01:28:39
Yeah. I think right now the biggest thing is the time and the help.

Chris Andrade: 01:28:44
Right, Right. Because. Because. So backstory. So it's just you and the Mrs. And that's it.

Toby: 01:28:51
Yeah. So I've got a buddy that generally he watches the store on Fridays unless he has to work at the grocery store. It's someone that I used to work with for, like, a decade at the grocery store. And long story short, he went through, like, a bout of, like, really bad colon cancer, and then, like, his relationship went south, got. They were, like, engaged, so they. They broke up. They're no more. It was like, a mess. He left in the middle of his treatment. He's got all kinds of medical bills and debt, stuff like that. But I think a part of it was, yeah, he needs the money. But he's like, dude, he's like, I'll do it for 10 bucks an hour. He's like, I just don't want to be home alone, you know, stuck there. So he comes in on Fridays and he's like, I don't care. 10 bucks an hour.

Chris Andrade: 01:29:41
And you've been doing a lot of that because with your wife and how involved you guys are in the community, dude, because you guys been there for how long? When did you get into. In Yuma?

Toby: 01:29:53
She was born here. I've been here since 2002.

Chris Andrade: 01:29:56
Yeah, man, that's when you left my ass, bro. So listen, like. And you guys have been a part of the community. Community, right? And, like, that goes a long way. Like, it's so easy to tell your story, right? It's just like, the hope, right? All those boils down to the hope, right? And. And how long have you had this problem for?

Toby: 01:30:22
What do you mean?

Chris Andrade: 01:30:22
Like, like this problem of help, the ad creation, the, you know, like your inventory management, or if that is a problem problem, like all these issues. How long have you had this issue for?

Toby: 01:30:36
Well, it's basically been since day one. You know, we don't. We don't know what the. We're doing. Like, we're just kind of winging it, and we're doing a lot of stuff improperly. We're trying to do everything on our own. No outside capital, no outside help. And, you know, so we're. We're drowning a little bit, you know, because we're trying to juggle too many things, but.

Chris Andrade: 01:30:55
Right.

Toby: 01:30:56
We're getting better at it. My buddy that watches the store on Fridays, the grocery store paid for him to do some sort of accounting degree.

Chris Andrade: 01:31:05
Oh, really?

Toby: 01:31:06
He's gonna help me. He's gonna help me start cleaning up my QuickBooks and get that all caught back up and get me set up for tax season.

Chris Andrade: 01:31:13
Have you ever had your QuickBooks reconciled?

Toby: 01:31:17
Maybe once last year or something for tax season. But I think I got. I got bad on, on tax stuff.

Chris Andrade: 01:31:25
I remember, I remember. And then. Hey, I'm going to ask you a question. Do you know what your daily operating cost is? Ultimately? A calculation of everything that you pay. It takes. Electricity, rent, insurance, every. All of the consumables every day, the gas, the energy, everything that it takes. Like how much do you pay yourself per day? All that.

Toby: 01:32:04
So right now we're not even paying ourselves. We're just reinvesting everything. The only thing, the only way that we really pay ourselves is like, we pay our car bills. So like the, the store van, it pays for that. It pays for Susie's car. And other than that, we don't take any money out of the accounts for ourselves.

Chris Andrade: 01:32:24
Right.

Toby: 01:32:25
It's all reinvested back in there. So for us right now, it. Paying two car bills is, Is doing enough for us, you know, and then we just reinvest back in inventory. So we're slowly but surely.

Chris Andrade: 01:32:36
I got what you're saying.

Toby: 01:32:37
Inventory and growing and growing.

Chris Andrade: 01:32:40
Do you have an inventory manager? Is that all through square too?

Toby: 01:32:45
Yeah. So square tracks everything. As long as we put it in there. If we remember to put it in there, it tracks it.

Chris Andrade: 01:32:51
How often do you forget to put it in there?

Toby: 01:32:54
We're getting better, but there's, there's plenty of times you'll go in there and it says, like, oh, it says you've got negative six of these on hand, but I see five, five of them out, which means the last time we got an order, we didn't put it in. So.

Chris Andrade: 01:33:08
And how much do you think you've at that problem alone costing you?

Toby: 01:33:16
It's more about the time, you know.

Chris Andrade: 01:33:18
Put a dollar figure, bro.

Toby: 01:33:19
Put a dollar figure. Do it know, let's say a few hours a month of, of, you know, going back through. And let's say 10 hours a month where you have to go through and like.

Chris Andrade: 01:33:37
And I charge $75 an hour for your time, just so you know. So that's $75 times set about times 10 hours. A week? A month?

Toby: 01:33:49
Yeah, a month.

Chris Andrade: 01:33:50
Okay. Okay.

Toby: 01:33:51
Cool.

Chris Andrade: 01:33:52
Cool. You know, that's, that's like going right for your, your. What you DO is a 75 hour consultation fee all day. I can even, you know, that'll go up, but. Yeah, how do you prove it? Right? And if you did nothing for the next six to 12 months, like, what does that look like? The consequences, the amplification of the urgency, what you're learning with AI and the things that you can see yourself doing. And if you just did nothing, what do you think that I did?

Toby: 01:34:28
Nothing. You've been do exactly what I'm doing right now and not change anything.

Chris Andrade: 01:34:32
Yeah. Like, what does that look like for you?

Toby: 01:34:37
Well, I mean, basically we just stay afloat and we, we get by slowly, you know, very, very, very minimal growth per year. But like I said, I think this, this little bit of advertising I saw, so by accident I, I picked the wrong picture for, for my first Instagram ad, right? So I thought I was going to do a collage, but I ended up messing up and I just did one picture and it was of a wall of all of our taxidermied insects, you know, so it was like a cool. It was like the fireplace with a bunch of like framed insects, you know.

Chris Andrade: 01:35:18
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, the taxidermy section. Yeah, yeah.

Toby: 01:35:21
I saw a cool ass picture and at first I was like, I should change the picture. And I was like, you know what, it's a cool ass picture. I'm just gonna let it ride, right? The two weeks after that. I sold more frames in those two weeks than I had the last probably three months. No. So I'm like, okay, the ads are working. People saw that and then they came in and I sold a shitload of those frames. So before, you know, when, when we.

Chris Andrade: 01:35:50
Were real quick, real quick, what do those frames cost you.

Toby: 01:35:55
On average? About Depending on the species and the size, our small ones we might get for 20 to 25. And the big ones upwards of 50. The massive ones we're paying 100 plus right now. We've got it. At first we were kind of scared to put real prices on there and we were only marking them up like 50. We weren't doing the typical double your money retail, you know, because we were afraid that people wouldn't pay for it. And then we slowly started creeping up and now on almost all of them, except for the really pricey ones, we generally double double our money, so.

Chris Andrade: 01:36:36
Nice. That's my boy, dude. I think I could triple it, man. We'll get there. No worries. No worries.

Toby: 01:36:42
Yeah, because I mean, we get, we get people coming in from like Vegas or big cities and like, why are they so cheap here? They're like this, this butterfly that you're selling for 55 in Vegas would be 100 or 85 or 95, you know, so the out of towners know that, you know, like when they see it here, they're like, that's cheap compared to where we're at.

Chris Andrade: 01:37:01
So is there no way to get their testimonials? Do you have anything integrated to like, see, like, get people to scan your, to give you a goddamn review? Mr.

Toby: 01:37:10
So I've got that, but no one does it. And so you don't have a way.

Chris Andrade: 01:37:13
To incentivize them to scan that.

Toby: 01:37:16
This month I did like, I made a couple posts, hey, leave us Google reviews and we'll put you a entry into a plant raffle. So I think I'm just gonna do one of those a month or something.

Chris Andrade: 01:37:28
And how did I do, how did it perform?

Toby: 01:37:32
So I only made two posts. I made a post, I made a Instagram post that I made an Instagram reel. And I think what happens is, you know, a few people see it and then they just stop seeing it. But we got, we got like 20 something reviews in, in the matter of like two weeks. So it definitely worked. We went from 24 reviews to like 44 reviews. And there's still a couple days left, but I've noticed I haven't gotten any reviews in the last few days.

Chris Andrade: 01:37:58
So that's just one little implementation, bro. That's what I'm talking about. You doing the work that we've been talking about. Iterations, little blips to see. Let's test this.

Toby: 01:38:08
That's what you're doing. I think the next one that I'm gonna do is, you know, so same thing, free plant R. Something rare, something worth their time. But what I'll do is, you know, free entry with, with any purchase. All you have to do is take a picture of your purchase and tag us, you know, boom. So take it, you know, when you, when you get your purchase home or you can do it in the store, I don't really give a. Like, if you hold it up and take a picture with a cool back backdrop in the store, tag us on your social media. Boom. One, one entry.

Chris Andrade: 01:38:47
Boom. That's right. That's right.

Toby: 01:38:51
All their friends.

Chris Andrade: 01:38:51
Yeah.

Toby: 01:38:52
So I think, yeah, I think I need to do that every month and just stay on top of it. And that's going to help push the growth, you know, so.

Chris Andrade: 01:38:59
Oh yeah. So if, if you had a magic wand, right? I gave you a magic wand. I put that in your hand and you can wave it to do anything in your business and fix it, what would that look like? Like, like what that give me in like a blue blueprint. What, like not what we want to sell, but what does success looks like? Like, what does success looks like to you?

Toby: 01:39:29
I think so. You've seen pictures of the store? The store is cool looking everyone that comes in if they've never been in there, like, holy. Like this place is awesome. So I need to get just new people in the door. I need to get enough new business and sales to where I can afford to have a like regular employee. Someone who's competent though, you know, it's like you can't have just anyone in there. You have to have someone who knows plants, but you also have to have someone who has the, the look, the manners, you know, the social skills. So a lot of plant people are kind of introverts, you know, it's like, so you have to have someone who's social enough to engage with customers, but also someone who knows what the fuck they're doing with plants. Because if they sit there and over water my plants back to back to back, they're all going to die.

Chris Andrade: 01:40:27
So, so you're telling me like, do you have a checklist that people follow to like ultimately do their daily routines to make sure shit's getting done? Like, do you have a way of doing that by any means?

Toby: 01:40:46
It's funny you said, I'm sorry, I'm eating, so I'm.

Chris Andrade: 01:40:48
No, you're fine. Yeah, that's fine.

Toby: 01:40:54
I was actually going to. So one thing that I've. I've kind of soaked up from, from firefighting is they have guidelines and standard operated procedures for everything. Everything doesn't matter. The simplest task, there's an SOP and a guideline in the, in the city, like files for everything. So I'm like, man, I need to start, you know, I'm not going to do it myself. I'm going to have chat. GPT. Hey, write me up a standard operating procedure for my boy.

Chris Andrade: 01:41:30
Dude, you know who gave you that idea? You can give me credit. It's fine. I don't need it. But that's cool. I'm so proud of you though.

Toby: 01:41:38
So, yeah, I think, you know, I need to have like a little laminated set.

Chris Andrade: 01:41:41
Yep.

Toby: 01:41:41
And have the SOPs and guidelines for, for all the stuff.

Chris Andrade: 01:41:46
No. So let Me say if. What if you had a. What if you had your own little app that was able to be. Oh, did you make sure that you watched that Philogen, or was that that the elephant ear? The like like check, right? And then make sure that that got done. And being able to verify it got done with like maybe a picture or something. Right? And like being able to create a checklist that somebody can follow every day, that would be helpful, right?

Toby: 01:42:18
Yeah, I think a checklist. Basically they just need to learn how to water plants. That's the biggest thing. And then.

Chris Andrade: 01:42:27
But then you have over water underwater. So maybe like maybe you're watering with the moisture soil content or a moisture sensor to verify that the. You know, soils at a certain rate. PH is. I mean, it's not hard. It's a perfect. Right? There's an easy way to. To validate every. On a schedule, right? To make sure that at least once a week every single plant has been diary or whatever. And then dude, honestly, like that diary can be sold with the plant eventually, like straight up. Like, then that plant has a story of. Of the maples apothecary life cycle. And then you're buying that plant story. And here you go. Here's our app to use to make sure. You might make sure that water and soil temperature, all that information to support that plant's life is at your fingertips.

Toby: 01:43:25
So that would be something for the future I've thought about is basically for every plant species or whatever, have a care card and just, you know, put it by the plants, you know, so take a picture of this if you need it, you know, right. It's going to have the information on it and.

Chris Andrade: 01:43:45
Oh, so you're telling me if you had a way to. For people to schedule you for an hour and give you a 75 deposit and then it would actually make use of your time to like make a phone call through your own app. That'd be cool.

Toby: 01:44:02
Yeah. Just I don't know. I don't know if Yuma. There's obviously people in Yuma with money who'll be like, oh yeah, okay, 75 bucks. I'll pay 150 bucks. But I think a lot of the people are. Are like especially the younger crowd. They're just be like, I don't learn it off YouTube.

Chris Andrade: 01:44:20
No, no, I'm talking about like, if your plan works right and you develop your brand the way you plan, like, I'm talking like nationwide, like, and like, so I have a friend from high school that's doing the same thing. You're doing down in Texas. And eventually I'm going to connect you guys because she has access to plants that you may need. And this is the idea behind the Polymath Guild, right? Connecting my specialists with other specialists. Right. And so you are one in Yuma, Casey is one down in Texas. And she's killing it, dude. She's killing it. It's just straight off with the Philologens and the, the elephant ears and the like, just the simple basic, you know, and you got the exoticness going on. And I was like, damn, she can team up with you. And you guys create your own proprietary strains that we know, we've talked about that we've experimented with all that. I like all that research that we put. Create your own species. Like, dude.

Toby: 01:45:21
Yeah. So my goal, my goal right now, like I said, if I can get some help, I can get more customers flowing in, you know, because the more customers that flow in, the more help I'm able to afford. But so like the, my niece's boyfriend, he'll. He'll volunteer for free for the first few months. So that's, that's a huge help, you know, and I can get these couple projects off the ground and running.

Chris Andrade: 01:45:48
What would you have him start doing, like, if you had a game plan for him to implement from day one? What does that look like?

Toby: 01:45:55
Basically my biggest thing right now is, is I'm a bit disorganized down in the basement. So I need to get my stuff together down here, luckily, right now.

Chris Andrade: 01:46:05
What do you mean stuff? Elaborate on that for me, big guy.

Toby: 01:46:08
I just have a bunch of down here, like just disorganized storage. But I have my, my grow tent where when I import, right. So I bring everything into this, import the 10 foot by 10 foot tents, and I acclimate everything in here. And that's like a two month process, right?

Chris Andrade: 01:46:23
Oh, so you bring everything to acclimate and it's a two month process?

Toby: 01:46:27
Yeah, yeah. So what I want to do, because acclimation is a pain in the ass right there, they're at their most vulnerable state during acclamation. So I need to be in there daily checking on stuff, making sure the moisture content's good and they're, they're doing well, whatever that's.

Chris Andrade: 01:46:44
Richard, we've had grow botics online, right? But no, keep going, keep going. Right.

Toby: 01:46:48
What I need, what I need right now is to automate some of the processes in here. So like right now I have everything on just metal wire racks. Like typical wire racks you can get at the hardware Store and then I just have trays, right? Just nursery flats, 10 by 20s that'll hold water and I have a bunch of 4 inch plants sitting in trays and then I'll water them in the trays.

Chris Andrade: 01:47:10
Or real quick, I'm just curious, so you have a 10 by 10 plant tent, right? How many plants are you producing out of that? 10 by 10. That could ultimately generate, really produce some air.

Toby: 01:47:24
I, I import, then I acclimate in there and then I bring them up to the shop.

Chris Andrade: 01:47:27
So, so that process, the acclimation process, if you quantified it per, per process. You said two week process, two month process. I'm sorry, how many plants are you acclimating in two months?

Toby: 01:47:42
Generally what I'll do is I'll import about 350 plants at a time. So what I'll do is I'll order, I'll order a few like bigger, higher end plants and then I'll also order a shitload of smaller, cheaper plants that have a good markup, that don't weigh a lot or take up a lot of room. That way my cost per plant to ship goes down dramatically, you know, so. Because it might be 600 to, to ship this order, right. But if I just ordered 25 rare monsteras that take me forever to sell because they're 200 a piece, my cost per plant to ship is ludicrous, you know, so I have to factor that in. But if in the same box there's room for me to add in, you know, 200 small, little, little guys, like little tiny plants that are, you know, maybe 6 inches long and a single vine and they can just jam pack the box in there. Now, instead of 25 monsteras, now I've got 325 plants in that box. And now my cost per plant to ship is $2 instead of 3. 25, you know. Right. So, so what I try and do is I bring in 300 plants. That way my cost per, per plant to ship is around 2 bucks. And that's what drives my profits up. But there, there's plants here that, that I can still get super rare. They're not really in the mass produced market yet. They're coming around, but they're not there yet. So I pay about $3.50 for them and I sell them for 35 bucks.

Chris Andrade: 01:49:19
So what's preventing you from creating a progressive grow system?

Toby: 01:49:26
Time and help. Yeah, time and help. That's all it is. That's all I need right now is, is time and help.

Chris Andrade: 01:49:32
How much money would that cost? You just on the setup side you think, don't know.

Toby: 01:49:39
So let me like set up. It wouldn't be that bad. I think for a few thousand I could do. It's because. So it just depends. Right. So I'm, I, I like DIY stuff because I save money.

Chris Andrade: 01:49:51
But no but yeah, just like the diy if you had just a turnkey, top notch, all your just plug and play. What is that price? Like 15 grand per tent?

Toby: 01:50:03
Oh no, not per 10. That would probably be 10 grams total. And I don't know what size we're talking here.

Chris Andrade: 01:50:10
10 by 10. Just a complete mock up.

Toby: 01:50:14
To do this tent to fill it up to its maximum potential. I could probably do it for less than five grand.

Chris Andrade: 01:50:24
So five is that with plants.

Toby: 01:50:33
Itself might cost me just in hardware alone, let's say 1500 to set this up like automated. And it'll, it'll take you know, a day's worth of DIY setting stuff up, but not, not like building from scratch, you know. So.

Chris Andrade: 01:50:50
And that would be accounted for. No but yeah. So ultimately if you had a ten thousand dollar injection to pretty much cop. Build you a progressive type setup. Yeah. And, and then that way you're constantly turning and burning. Right. And, and producing a constant flow revenue stream. So to manage that, how many hours do you think it takes to manage one tent per day?

Toby: 01:51:20
We're setting up system where everything is automated on the drip system, timers, reservoirs that recycle, all that stuff. Obviously the more time you spend in there the better. But if everything's functioning properly, there's no reason why you couldn't get in there, check on everything. If nothing's out of whack or broken. An hour a day would be all you need.

Chris Andrade: 01:51:50
So if somebody had a checklist to follow a checklist every single day, you're saying that one hour per tent will make sure that those plans are at optimum conditions. Yeah.

Toby: 01:52:04
So spend a little bit more time. Preventative pest management, stuff like that.

Chris Andrade: 01:52:13
So, so, so hour a day maintenance plus another additional hour per week for pest control cleaned up and. Yep. And maintain maintenance of just the system itself. So that's not bad. That's easy. Quantifiable. And then my question to you is to like so, so that's. And then how many hours are you open a day or. Yeah. And per week.

Toby: 01:52:46
Through Saturday from 11 to 5. So six hours on those days and then Sundays 12 to 4. Four hours.

Chris Andrade: 01:52:54
Okay. Okay. So what realistically hourly rate would you need to think that you can get away with like that's comfortable, right, that you want to get. If you could pay for a quality guy, like what would that hourly rate look like?

Toby: 01:53:13
Someone that I would trust with all this is the, this is boyfriend. He's let's say he's like autistic just enough to make him like socially awkward. But he like dives headfirst into like if he's interested in it. Like he goes 100 full bore. So he's really into like the plant horticulture stuff. So the, for the first, you know, let's say three months, he would be volunteering 100 free. Then after that, my guess is he'd probably be willing to do it for 20 bucks an hour. I think minimum wage here is 15.

Chris Andrade: 01:53:48
So you keep referring to this guy and I really like leveraging an idea based on this guy. And I think what I, I'm not supposed to suggest anything to you right now, but as a friend chiming in like if they're like if you can give this dude a game plan, right? And then like hey, this is this plan that we want to, that we're we paid for, right. And we have all, we have this team helping us come up with this game plan. And little does he know that game plan, if he follows it will allow you to justify how much you could really afford off of that. Right? Yeah, but obviously like with what you're talking about and I love that you're saying it because this is something that we you noticing that companies don't even know how a proposal sent or an email should look like or how does a customer engagement look like and somebody like who has autistic and if he had something to follow like a legit playbook of what it looks like, how do I need to open the door? Where are the light switches at? What do I needed an alarm to turn off? Do I need to, do I need to open up the blinds? Like the lights? Like where are those switches at? Is there a map into the store? Are there, is there, is there sections like that pre made, you know what I'm saying? And so I want to come down there. Toby, remember how I told you about all the camera stuff like I can create now I got the Insta360 where I can come in and do a 3D model now of your store and so we can do like version virtual tours and now and then I'll get all the high end photos and all the camera stuff, you know, and I'll bring all that in like we talked about and then. Yeah but I, I, I Know we can help you, man. And I'm so excited for once, dude, that we've been talking for once in my life, bro, I got a game plan for you that's gonna blow you and Susie's mind away. And so. And you said this guy is Susie? Nephew, cousin.

Toby: 01:55:53
He's boy, son. He's like your niece.

Chris Andrade: 01:56:03
Oh, okay. We'll talk about that later. Okay, awesome. Awesome. Okay, so I do regardless as I got, I got some cool to show you and I know you've been messing around with AI, so you kind of got an idea idea of what we're talking about. But is there any questions that you have or ideas like oh, by the way, what's your website? How's that looking? Got it.

Toby: 01:56:34
Nope. Yeah, take a look at looks nice, but it's not super functional and there's not a lot going on. It's basically like a landing page and then a couple product page that says what we carry and whatever. But I don't sell anything through there. There's not like a. It's not, it's not overly functional, but people can go there and see pictures of the shop.

Chris Andrade: 01:56:55
Wait, so if I gave you that magic wand to fix your website, what does that look like?

Toby: 01:57:03
So for me, the biggest thing for me is stocking up on this rare inventory and getting it listed through the website.

Chris Andrade: 01:57:15
Which one in particular, bro? Which one's the ones that you wanting to get into? Like I knew. So you have all the plants that in like the turnover rates and sheets. I hope God, please tell me you have spreadsheets on your inventory and your pen.

Toby: 01:57:31
It's all tractor square. So can we. We put everything in by the species.

Chris Andrade: 01:57:35
Okay. So we should be able to extract all that. That and then, and then we're talking about names, volume sizes, all that too, huh?

Toby: 01:57:45
Yeah. So how do I put everything in?

Chris Andrade: 01:57:47
Yeah, yeah.

Toby: 01:57:48
So like let's say just a normal fillet in heart leaf. Then it'll be by size, so 4 inch, 6 inch, 8 inch. And then it'll tell me how many of each of those were sold in what period and whatever, you know. So each plant is categorized by size and then I can look at, you know, which, which one's selling the most and blah, blah, blah. Like I don't, I don't actually use that feature much and I know I need to, but I know it's there so I can go back and it'll tell me, you know, my top, top 10 best selling items, my top categories, all that stuff is there. I just haven't really played with it much, so.

Chris Andrade: 01:58:29
Okay, well, no, that's cool.

Toby: 01:58:30
I mean, trying to find my bathroom key. I'm, like, about to piss my hands.

Chris Andrade: 01:58:35
Yeah, me too. Let me be right back real quick. Give me five. Give me. Give me five minutes if you're cool, because I want to keep going if you can.

Toby: 01:58:41
Yeah, yeah, that's fine.

Chris Andrade: 01:58:42
Okay.

Toby: 01:58:42
I'm chilling in my shop and no one's here. The whole building.

Chris Andrade: 01:58:45
Okay, cool. So hold on. I'll be right back to you because I gotta take a leave.

Toby: 01:58:48
All right, cool.

Chris Andrade: 01:58:52
Don't hang up, Matthew. Don't hang up. This is like gold.

Toby: 01:58:56
Not a chance.

Chris Andrade: 01:58:57
All right.

Toby: 01:59:02
Pay. Back.

Chris Andrade: 02:01:06
You there?

Toby: 02:01:10
Yep.

Chris Andrade: 02:01:12
Bro, I've been waiting to have this conversation for decades.

Toby: 02:01:16
Holy. Dude, it's so. It's so good. I love it, dude. Decades, bro.

Chris Andrade: 02:01:25
I've known this guy for. He's been my best friend. So long story short, I was kidnapped as a kid. I had to move to Flagstaff. He was my very first friend in Flagstaff. Like, why? He was my very first friend in the fifth grade.

Toby: 02:01:42
Sixth grade. Wow.

Chris Andrade: 02:01:44
And then he moved out of flagship in 2002. That's why he said he left me. He left me in 2002 and moved to Yuma.

Toby: 02:01:53
Okay. Wow.

Chris Andrade: 02:01:55
Which my brother moves. Were all good friends. My brother lived in Yuma after high school and played football for Yuma. So. Yeah, we have, like. This is like a family friend, bro. This is like somebody I've known for my whole life.

Toby: 02:02:15
Yeah. Wow. So cool.

Chris Andrade: 02:02:18
So let me give them a call back.

Toby: 02:02:23
So promising, dude.

Chris Andrade: 02:02:29
Now, you know, like, this is why the ROI calculator is so important.

Toby: 02:02:34
Yeah.

Chris Andrade: 02:02:36
That's why I'm asking all those numbers, because it's going to be easy to get some sort of estimation.

Toby: 02:02:41
Yeah, that's great. Those are great questions.

Chris Andrade: 02:02:43
Yeah. Yeah. So I'm really curious, like, if there was a way, like we were talking about, you had this sop.

Toby: 02:02:53
Like.

Chris Andrade: 02:02:54
Like, do you significantly think if he's doing eight hours or how many we. How many hours per week? Toby, how many did you say?

Toby: 02:03:08
Run one of those tents?

Chris Andrade: 02:03:09
No, no, no. To run just the store. How many hours per week does it take that. Are you open?

Toby: 02:03:16
So let's see. I think 28 hours right now. And doing that math in my head. So Yeah, I think four days a week, we're open for six hours. So that's 24. And then Sunday's 12 to 4. So that's 28.

Chris Andrade: 02:03:32
28 hours are open. And if you add maybe a two hours every week for setup and close down, that's 30 hours a week.

Toby: 02:03:42
Yeah, I mean, I guess that's something about. Right.

Chris Andrade: 02:03:44
Okay. Okay. And at $20. Okay, cool. And then is there something else? That missing component, Like, I know like you we talked about building like your own language model.

Toby: 02:04:05
Right.

Chris Andrade: 02:04:05
For people to reference. Right. And ultimately.

Toby: 02:04:09
Sounds familiar earlier.

Chris Andrade: 02:04:10
What, what, what you do with like, like for example, the, the classes that you held that were a huge success. Right? That's exactly what I'm talking about. Like your own, your own language, your own ability for your own plants. Right. This is how your plants live. This is what you do to take care for. You know, like, you had really good success. Right. So much so that it was like, damn, you need bigger spaces. And how many people attended that?

Toby: 02:04:40
The biggest class was 27 people at 30 bucks ahead.

Chris Andrade: 02:04:45
And then you promised them a plant.

Toby: 02:04:51
The first one I did promise a free plant. That one I did not. So the very first one I included. Yeah, maybe 12 or 15, I think. 12, something like that.

Chris Andrade: 02:05:07
And how much time and effort did it take you to do one show?

Toby: 02:05:11
You think it's a two hour class.

Chris Andrade: 02:05:14
And then to set up and build?

Toby: 02:05:18
Yeah, you know, since it was my first one, I. That one, I put some time and effort into designing the curriculum and all that stuff. So, you know, I put a few hours into that and then just, you know, setting them, you know, moving, taking all my stuff over to the, to the space, to the venue, and then bringing it back and all that stuff. So it's a pretty minimal investment, especially now. Now that I have the curriculum set up, it's, you know, I just literally take a couple totes full of stuff and maybe I'll take a handful of stuff I think might sell, you know, bags of soil, a few plants, few popular plants. And then, and then that's it. There's a venue that I get to use that's right around the corner. I can literally walk there. It's next to our building. So she let us use it for free last time and then this the next few times. If we use it, she'll probably just charge us, you know, 150 bucks. 100 bucks? I don't know. We haven't set a rate, but yeah, she. It's. It's open to us if we want.

Chris Andrade: 02:06:21
So let's just play around. Just for contingency sake. Let's say 200 to rent the venue. And you saying how many people per shot you did?

Toby: 02:06:34
Let's see, the biggest one was 27. The last one was kind of Impromptu and there was only like 12 people there, so I definitely wouldn't pay, you know, 200 bucks to rent a venue if I'm only making 40 bucks, you know.

Chris Andrade: 02:06:47
So how much did you make per guy? Per. Per attendance?

Toby: 02:06:50
30 bucks ahead. That's what I charge. And then, and then.

Chris Andrade: 02:06:53
Okay, and then you said collectively, how many plants did you give away at how much?

Toby: 02:06:58
No, I, I don't give anything away anymore.

Chris Andrade: 02:07:00
Okay.

Toby: 02:07:00
The very first class I did, but I don't anymore.

Chris Andrade: 02:07:03
Why is that?

Toby: 02:07:08
Because I, it's, it's a six dollar loss, you know, if I give stuff away. So. Hold on one second. What? I haven't done anything. But. Yeah, because I, It's a six dollar loss times however many people. So it's like. Yeah, I'm not gonna.

Chris Andrade: 02:07:30
Yeah. And I guess it more. It's like a marketing loss cost. Right. Ultimately at the end of the day. Because if you can incentivize at the end of the day, you kind of, of have to give away for free to get people to listen. You know what I'm saying?

Toby: 02:07:43
Yeah, sometimes. But I told, I told Susie, I was like, I want to see if the class stands on its own without giving away free.

Chris Andrade: 02:07:51
Yeah.

Toby: 02:07:52
And that's when we had 27 people sign up. So I only had one person like, oh, you're not giving a free plan away. That one out of 27. So I'm like, yeah, so I'm, I'm fine with that, you know.

Chris Andrade: 02:08:07
So what about this then? What if you had a special selection of plants that you're saying, hey, just because you guys attended my class, I'll. You guys get special pricing to lose one plant? Because that's.

Toby: 02:08:21
Yeah, we talked about, we talked about doing something where like, if they attend a class, they get, you know, X amount of percent off of.

Chris Andrade: 02:08:29
Yeah, I think that's the right way because that's what I'm trying to do for my, my parents with the dealership, you know what I'm saying? It's like, how do you get people to come in? You gotta incentivize and give away, unfortunately, you know. But if I rather give money a way to do something like that versus somebody to run a Facebook ad, you know?

Toby: 02:08:49
Yeah.

Chris Andrade: 02:08:51
If you think if he, if your employee was able to use a phone while it's kind of slow and use the phone to gather data, daily marketing material and go like, like follow a script and like upload that stuff, do you think that's something that he would do?

Toby: 02:09:08
Depends on how involved you're talking like.

Chris Andrade: 02:09:11
Like seriously, go take two or three pictures every day of different plans and just upload them. Yeah. Like you have like a pre designated phone or old tablet or something that just sits at the office and he's just logged in to the one account and all he has to do is just take picture of the, of a new plant and just send it every single morning. A part of his morning routine. Is that something that he can do?

Toby: 02:09:40
I don't see why not. Like, you know, be like, hey, whoever's here, take a picture of something, anything, whether it's a plant, a cool feature wall or something and just make a post.

Chris Andrade: 02:09:50
Yeah. And then like set off a timer where like they do that once or twice a day because, you know, you're not busy all, all the time. So you have to give the, you got to give them tasks and that's where the checklist comes into play. Because this is what I'm trying to do for the dealerships. Like, yeah, they're sitting there at the dealer and if you're getting five people a day and you're open for 28 hours a week, then, you know what I mean? Like, there's a lot of time in between there. Right. What the are you doing? How come I'm not seeing pictures? How come I'm not these buildings dirty? Like, like get the, off the computer. Go get, get your steps in. Like get some done, like post some, you know, and ultimately it's because there's not a playbook for them to follow. You know what I'm saying? And that's where we're trying to kind of implement ultimately is let's build that out. Let's start there. That's where this assessment comes into play. Play. And then now we have a playbook. Now we have something to core, hold these people accountable and hold us accountable as bosses too. Because ultimately if we're not giving them what they need to do their job, then that shit's on us. Right. And then, and then that, that's our fault. But we need to know that we need to anticipate that kind of. But if you can't, then you're kind of, you know, we're all. So let's unfuck it by just creating these things in place. And that's ultimately, dude, this is what we're good at. Oh, I mean, it's not gonna hurt. Consistency is key. Consistency is king. And, and you know who Alex Hermosi is, right? Yeah.

Toby: 02:11:40
Yeah.

Chris Andrade: 02:11:40
So, dude, he started a podcast by just releasing one every week, and it was Just like, like, just, like, just him, like his journal, you know, like, he just. As people, he did it every single week for three years, and it became like the ultimate podcast just because he was consistent, you know, that's what I'm trying to do, and that's what I think you should try. Like, this is where the Polymath Guild comes, Comes into play. Beyond the AI services and the what, what we're trying to do with the technology. At the end of the day, that's where I want. This is where the communication, the collaboration comes into play with the group, you know, and that's the kind of. That I want to talk about, and that's what motivates me to not only help these developers that you're going to meet, they're going to blow your mind grind the. Wait till you see the team I got, dude. You're gonna be like, how the. I don't know, bro. I, I. Destiny is a son of a. Like, I. Wait. Like, you know how hard I've been pushing out of anybody in this world, truly, and how long I've been grinding. No one knows more than you. All right, so it's kind of crazy how it came true. And I can't wait to show you guys what, what we got.

Toby: 02:13:00
Let me.

Chris Andrade: 02:13:01
Yeah. You gave me so much, bro. I got so much to run with. I'll talk to you later. Bye. Yeah, that's. That, that's my boy right there.

Toby: 02:13:16
Man. Amazing, man. That's so cool.

Chris Andrade: 02:13:20
Straight up, Straight up. Like, see how easy it is to structure that conversation to get that information? But then you know what? I can do that because he's my boy.

Toby: 02:13:35
Yeah.

Chris Andrade: 02:13:36
When you're doing that with a stranger, it's a little different, obviously, but I had to just do it. I had to push the envelope because I needed to hear. I needed that data. I needed to hear it.

Toby: 02:13:48
Yeah, dude, we can do so much with that already. Like, plans.

Chris Andrade: 02:13:54
I almost feel like ending the meeting right now. Or should we keep going?

Toby: 02:14:00
I think that's a good idea because we talked about some other stuff we're gonna have to separate out. And then we definitely want to pull the Maples apothecary.

Chris Andrade: 02:14:10
Give me a break, because my throat is all on fire, dude. Like, this moment. He's so fired. When I straight up. Matthew, did you hear that end part there? Like, nobody knows how hard I've been grinding more than that guy right there.

Toby: 02:14:27
Yeah.

Chris Andrade: 02:14:28
And the fact that I have finally came, have a, an ability to help him and help me and, dude, the success story that he's gonna be for us and how much we can help him so easily is gonna be truly.

Toby: 02:14:47
It's gonna be so cool. I can't wait. Dude. Yeah, I was literally thinking like I just talked with Claude a little bit like during that call and we have so many opportunities that need to get built out and we have like I have all this compute time because I have Claude like max plan and right now autocloud isn't running and I'm just like I need to freaking plan stuff. I need to get stuff moving. This like building out this app, this website. Like you know, I need to prioritize cause we need to deliver for Plotter but like it's already started building the inventory management system so I need to get my stuff in order so that I'm just optimizing that compute time and like start building stuff out from all these ideas.

Chris Andrade: 02:15:39
So how do you do you journal? Like would you write down like how's your thought process? Like how do you keep track of your bro?

Toby: 02:15:46
I now I. For the last month or two I've been doing that on walks every day for like maybe not every day. No, I think every day for the last several weeks with clog code os, with the development OS and there's like daily logs for pretty much every. Every time I go for a walk I just talk with Claude, I push it, I merge it with the main and like so it's all in there. It's all in there. And what Mekaiel was saying is like we're gonna transform that into content at some point, you know?

Chris Andrade: 02:16:28
Yeah. Because dude, wait till Trent and Mekaiel hear this conversation. Yeah, let's go ahead and end this. I'm going to include his website in here as well. I'm looking at. So dude, you're. This is a part of the self sustainable practices that I'm talking about, this homesteading lifestyle app. He would be the specialist that we would call to verify garden beds, like to soil amendments. We would send test kits out, we would make sure that the soil is ready for the plants that going in there. Like all this verifiable is integrated with just gardens and, and certifying grow beds. Right. That's the, that I'm talking about like and dude you guys are just scratching the surface here.

Toby: 02:17:27
That's something I've literally like it's kind of crazy how this stuff overlaps because I've always wanted, I've always envisioned like it'd be so cool to learn about all this stuff and just like understand how to self reliance like, survive on my own out in the wilderness. And it's just like, I had no idea how the heck I'm gonna do it. Like, I've never looked into it myself, really, but I was always.

Chris Andrade: 02:17:48
I still gotta learn how to kill and gut and clean something. I haven't done that yet. I have not. That's one thing that I have not done. And I. I've grown up with guns my whole life. Since I was like, seven is I. I've had my first gun. I was Never killed anything, though, because I didn't want to eat it. Ultimately, at the end of the day, I would never, never do that. So.

Toby: 02:18:18
Yeah, I've never. I've never, like, shot a gun. I've never. I held my first one a couple months ago for the first time.

Chris Andrade: 02:18:25
Oh, no. Yeah. My son, he shot his first gun when he was like, nine. And, yeah, dude, his first three rounds had a driving at a shooting range for a 1 inch. 1 inch. At 25 yards, dude. I was like, God damn. I was like. The video games did pay off.

Toby: 02:18:53
Yeah. I played Call of Duty. I did some paintball.

Chris Andrade: 02:18:56
Right. Dude, I'm so excited, dude. Okay. Everybody respond back and then. And yeah, I'll talk to you soon. I'll create the channel for Maples Apothecary. I'll get it all going.

Toby: 02:19:13
Okay. Sounds good, bro.

Chris Andrade: 02:19:15
Thanks.

Toby: 02:19:16
See you.
