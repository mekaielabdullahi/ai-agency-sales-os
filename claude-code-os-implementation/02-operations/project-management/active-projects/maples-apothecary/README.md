# Maples Apothecary

**Status:** Discovery Complete - Ready for Proposal

## Project Overview

Maples Apothecary is a specialty plant and exotic goods retail shop in Oldtown Yuma, AZ. Owner Toby (and wife Susie) operate the business with minimal staff, focusing on rare imported plants, taxidermied insects, and plant education classes.

**Core Problem:** Customer awareness. The shop experience is excellent (customers consistently amazed), but people don't know it exists. Every day Toby hears "I didn't know this building existed."

**Owner Quote:**
> "If I could get my ad in front of everyone in Yuma, I could turn this into a legitimate career."

## Pain Points (from discovery)

### Primary Pain Point: Customer Awareness
- "Every single day I hear 'I didn't know this building existed'"
- Oldtown Yuma historically a "ghost town" - perception hasn't caught up
- No systematic marketing or outreach
- No email/SMS marketing
- Instagram growth stalled without paid campaigns

### Secondary Pain Points

| Pain Point | Impact | Quantified Cost |
|------------|--------|-----------------|
| Inventory entry forgotten | 10 hrs/month fixing discrepancies | ~$750/month |
| No SOPs/checklists | Can't delegate, owner-dependent | Owner time @ $75/hr |
| No employee accountability | Risky to hire without playbooks | Blocked growth |
| Manual grow operations | Time-consuming, error-prone | Unknown |
