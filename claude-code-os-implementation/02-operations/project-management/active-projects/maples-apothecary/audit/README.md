## Audit Summary

### Business Context

**Company:** Maples Apothecary
**Industry:** Specialty Retail / Horticulture
**Location:** Oldtown Yuma, AZ
**Owner:** Toby (with wife Susie)
**Staff:** Owner-operated + 1 part-time helper

**Products/Services:**
- Rare imported houseplants
- Taxidermied insects in frames
- Plant care classes and workshops
- Soil, pots, and plant care supplies

### Primary Bottleneck

**Customer Awareness** - The shop experience is excellent ("holy shit, this place is awesome"), but discovery is the problem.

> "Every single day I hear 'I didn't know this building existed'"

> "If I could get my ad in front of everyone in Yuma, I could turn this into a legitimate career"
