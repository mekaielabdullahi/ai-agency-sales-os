## Executive Summary

Maples Apothecary has a clear primary problem: **customer awareness**. The shop experience is excellent (customers are consistently amazed), but discovery is the bottleneck. Secondary issues around operational documentation and inventory management are real but less critical than the awareness gap.

**Key Insight from Owner:**
> "If I could get my ad in front of everyone in Yuma, I could turn this into a legitimate career."

## ROI Considerations

**Note:** Per discovery process guidelines, we do NOT fabricate ROI projections.

### Qualitative Impact Assessment

|-------------|------------------------------|

| **Google Reviews** | 20 reviews in 2 weeks from manual effort. Automation = continuous social proof |
| **SOPs/Checklists** | Enables $20/hr employee vs. $75/hr owner time. 28 hrs/week × $55 difference = significant |
