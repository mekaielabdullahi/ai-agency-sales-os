Can you go with this? Can I go? I found some on this, and then I'll... What the hell is it?


How's that one looking? Well, why is it only like doing some and not all? That's what I want to know.


Yeah, only ran it through some because I wanted to... We can have it run for all of them, but I just wanted to run through and make sure that...


I wanted to work out bugs along the way. If we go through like five of them and they look good, then I can just run out of the rest of them.


And I have it set up where I can run it backwards, forwards on any number of them. Let's see here, 119, yeah, what point is we have to see if your automation works, why don't you run through, can you run through everything that up to this date right here?


Anything that happened since June, oh, can you do that? So run it from June 9th all the way to the present, and so we can check right now.


Okay. Thank you. Over. you. you. Thank Thank Thank you. Oh yeah, I need you to authenticate, I need to get your credentials renewed because those expire for a week for the automation to work.


Thank you. Did you have one pulled up before? I wasn't sure if you had one pulled up that I just exited.


We'll disconnect. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank Thank So this is something I have to work through and push to production and deploy.


So I think the best use of time is to go through the ones that have already been processed. We'll wait for that fix.


What do you mean you can't run through all these? I can't run through more until I fix this issue, which won't take long, but it will be a deployment and might take a few iterations.


But we have several that have already been processed and it would be It good if you can let me know how good they are and how bad they are.


I'm not going to write down the ones that are good. You're not going to. So when I see Matt, that means it ran through.


Yeah. Turn it up to 987. 9824. Four receipts. So it just combines the total. It would nice to have a breakdown I used to receive.


Okay. How much work is that? Does it really iterate through these or it just counts this? Yeah, no, it iterates through these.


And for the receipt total, it pulls from this extracted. But it doesn't show the computation. Like this receipts this, this receipts this, this receipts this, this receipts this.


Yeah, I kept this very simple. Got it. Okay. For now. now. For But there's all that stuff gets processed in the back end.


So anything that you think that we need or that would be useful for you, let's, you know, we'll, so now we have the transcript from, we'll have the transcript from what we said, so we can pull all that stuff after and just be like, okay, let's get this and this and this, and then we can prioritize.


My job is to audit, right? So I have go through each receipt, right? And then pull the totals and make sure it matches.


So if we're already doing the computation on the back end, it'd be nice to do the, the, the computations apply, like material receipt, receipt one is this, receipt two is this, receipt this, this, total that.


Okay. So just the, you just want a total from each receipt to show up. So like receipt one total?


$713.62. Okay. Right. Receipt total two. Yeah. Yeah. That, mean, I could probably do before I leave. It's just that.


Yeah. Yeah, I'll get one of these clothes working on that. Thank you. Yeah, so, I mean, it seems like it's catching the numbers are aligned from the invoice.


So material and labor, right? But if it's not broken down, I'm just going to have to count on myself and make sure that it's right, right?


But if it's broken down for me already, right here, all I got to do is pull this up, right?


This is $4,015. I wish it stayed that. Okay. And then what else would you want? Like, so would you want it to be like the file name or you just want like receipt one total?


Doodle. Doodle. Doodle. Doodle. Doodle. Doodle. Doodle. Thank And that's fine? Ideally it would be in order, right? Ideally it would be, like each receipt has a title, right?


Like this one has an invoice number, right? Or this one has what? No, this one have anything. File name for each one.


So the idea is you just need to check the receipt. The idea is I need to check the receipts, match the receipts given, and it adds up to the total, which is the totals right here.


You're giving me this, right? And it matches this, but I don't see the compensation. I still have to do it myself to make sure that's the ordering process.


Okay. All right. right. right. We'll there. We'll be Thank Okay. So the invoicing system's job has helped me audit, right?


Mm-hmm. So if it's broken out by just the total of these receipts, they'll show me that, okay, these receipts are aligned with what's given to me.


And it adds up to the total. When it doesn't add up, then we know that, A, it's the wrong receipt or something's off of the invoice, right?


Mm-hmm. But so far, without me double-checking these receipts, printing it out, and, like, adding the math myself, like, the numbers match, you know what mean?


These numbers match this so far for the ones I looked at, except maybe one. Yeah, the invoice extraction is pretty good.


The receipts one is the more complicated one. Oh, okay. Let me check this again. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.


It's connected, but then it redirected to the wrong setting page. It should say connected now. Thank you. Thank you.


Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. you. Thank you. you. Thank you. you. Thank Thank Thank you. Thank you. Thank


ACTION ITEM
Add numbered per-receipt totals to analysis email
Thank you. Thank you. Right now the analysis email breaks down the invoice and the receipts totals, but we want it to now print out results for each receipt, so the total amount for each receipt should be displayed in the analysis email right after the receipts totals.


We should number each receipt. Right now in the analysis emails, we have invoices breakdown and we have receipts breakdown.


Just after that, we want to display. Receipt totals individually. So it should say Receipt 1, Receipt total, then followed by Receipt 2, Receipt total for however many receipts there are.


So if there's only one receipt, it should only display one receipt and its total. So let's make this modification to the analysis email.


Can we run the analysis on the last 10 emails? you. Thank In the Walnut folder for. Thank you. Thank you.


Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Okay, I'm going to run it for the last, I'm just going to run it for the last, latest 10.


You know where it would help? What's that? If you can run it, it's June 9th? From July 10th up.


Okay. Can hear that? Yeah. The first July 10th. Everything before July 10th has been processed, paid, so I don't need to go through it.


But July 10th up would be amazing for just Walnut. Okay. Okay. Yeah, this is a good game. Okay. Okay.


I went. Okay. Okay. Okay. Thank you. You guys ready to win another championship? Yep. We barely pulled it off.


Wait, where's Alex? How come he's not playing? I don't know. I'm to miss you. One day, but he'll be back next week.


Next week there's two games. Who played center? Jordan. Jordan. The big tall black guy? Yeah. The one who plays overseas, right?


Yeah. So we lost to other Jordan. Yeah. He stopped playing. I so. I don't know. I haven't asked or heard about him.


How many guys you have that day? Who's Jethro? Who's that? Jethro? I've played in him before. He's pretty good.


The lefty guard. He can get to the paint and score. I've never been. He's decent. He's never played on Saucy, right?


I don't know. I think maybe he did before. Before? Yeah. I've never played in one before. I think it was with Coyle.


I'm not sure. There was a Jordan on the other team who I played with too. Yeah. And that guy is usually really good.


Bye. Bye. But he didn't do much in that game, thankfully. That team was honestly fairly stacked. Like, there's another guy who, like, is on that team who's on Tuesday nights, like the game I tonight, with my other team.


We played them, like, three weeks in a row. We won the first one, we lost to them in the playoffs, and then we won the next game we played them.


And their main guy from that team is on that team that we played yesterday. But he got there late.


He shouldn't have got there late. One-point game at the end. Yeah, one-point game. Yep. Jordan was having a hard time in the paint, actually.


Against. Against the team. There was, like, a big, there was a big Asian dude. He could have got a body in.


Yeah. Even though he was a lot shorter. And then they would double. And then the other team played well together.


And then we played Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So it doesn't matter about talent. It's just kind of straight. Mm-hmm. They swarmed them probably.


Yeah. And I think we didn't do too well moving the ball quickly to find the open man. Must be a double.


Yeah. Get stuck. Get stuck. Well, that was one of our problems was the ball get stuck. Yeah. It's been the problem.


The first 10 minutes, we had 25 points. Yeah. I heard you. I was reading the chats. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.


You are on fire. Yeah. That helps. I don't know what happened. I think I did one or two threes, and then I got a couple layups.


Yeah. And now the basket becomes an ocean. Yeah. It's just 25-9, moving up, and then the last 30 minutes, we only scored 26.


Is David not playing many minutes? Big David? I think he was playing minutes, but his shot just didn't go in that game.


He's not been playing well. Traveling, holidays, so it's tough. Yeah. And then cat, we're line. Yeah. Yeah, had like a four-week break or something.


Yeah, he went to Japan for two weeks. So, how was our captain? Playing well? Yeah. He did well. Not like an amazing game or anything.


None of us really had an amazing game. Like, I had a good stretch in the beginning, but after that, like, it was a battle.


For sure. Ruben had a couple of clutch threes down the stretch, and then Vincent had a couple of clutch plays also down the stretch.


So, I was actually on the bench the last five minutes, and like, everyone was doing well, so I was like, I don't even want to touch it.


yeah. It's good. Don't lose chemistry. Mm-hmm. then Jordan got us the game-winning bucket, because he was like, one of the last timeouts, he was like, instead of having himself start off in the post, he was like, start out, and then they can't double as much.


Yeah. Yeah, that worked. Yeah, simple adjustment. If you just start in there, zone in on you, right? Start out.


And then leak through. And then rotate. If you all start out and then have all eyes on him, have other people crash through.


You know mean? That really brings out the big because the big has to go out. That should clear the middle.


Yeah, that's right. But we only did that at one. We only had to do it at one play. We only figured it out at the last play.


And you're like, all right, give it the ball to Jordan. But it works, though. Yeah, man, I'm about to cheer you guys for another championship.


ACTION ITEM
Fix credential expiration; implement long-term solution across projects
You, Alex, Jordan, Roy, David. I have an Alex back with the mobile app. Okay. The system email credentials have to get renewed and your credentials have to get renewed.


I need to figure out a solution for that because that will affect every single project. So, you're telling me you can't reiterate the views right now?


It should be okay pretty soon. We've got your credentials enabled, confirmed that they work. Now it's just the system email.


I don't know. don't I don't know. No. Thank you. Thank you. Why do our credentials keep expiring and blocking running this automation?


What are good options for long-term fixes for this issue? Thank you. Thank Thank you. Thank Thank you. Thank you.


Thank you. you. Thank you. you. Thank you. Thank you. Okay, I did have a successful email sent to six of them so far.


Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.


Thank you. you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. We're going to upgrade your tech so you don't have to do this, that'd be on the calculator.


See? Yeah, this is my constraint right now. Yeah, for sure. That's why I wanted it. you. you. you. Thank Thank you.


you. Thank Thank I hope an automation will do this for me, but you're seeing me do it by hand every time.


Yep. Should be able to do it now. Look at 70. 2987. Okay, makes sense. 1170, it processed, so let's go find it.


Yeah, have it. I'm turning it out. This is it. Okay. This is 1170. Is it this one? This is the old one.


Yeah. Hold on. Go back to Walnut. 1170. Okay. So this should be totally this. Yeah, four minutes ago. So this is actually a refund, so see it's a minus sign right here, so I calculated it at first and I added everything, was wrong, so when I found out if the refund had matched just the total of an invoice.


Okay. So I would get them to recognize a minus right here and the total is actually a refund. Yeah, okay.


Yeah, cool. 11 said the one is a minus, so I'll just write that down. Receipt 2 is a minus.


Yeah, mean there's a few different ways we could. Yeah. And so, it's So we of check when they're off.


We can just be like, hey, if we flip the sign on any of them, does that make it right?


Or we just detect the minus and be like, this is a refund. Like, receipts could be a minus. Like, that's, I think, the smarter approach, right?


Receipt could be a refund if the total is a minus, basically. Receipts could be a refund, right? If you're seeing minus science and the total is a minus.


Yeah. It seems like a gauge for a refund, right? Yeah. I think we don't have refund detection logic yet.


Yeah, I don't think so either. Ideally, I'd be able to, we could go through them and see how many it happens for.


We have a good feel of that already, because it's happened a few times already, and that's one of the main things, I think, that throws it off.


So I'm thinking I'm just going to prioritize something now. I do think that right now I want to triage and get a big picture of all the things that are wrong.


Because once I know all the things that are wrong, then you can get to a working solution. Okay. We work on it at same time, but I'm just not sure anything else.


So are we supposed to figure out what's wrong or are we going to go through one by one and we'll find out what's wrong?


think let's... Is it? Wait. It did it as now? Wait. It's right. Yeah, I went through all the way to the back.


I didn't want to go all the way back. Yeah. I wanted to start from June 9. That makes sense?


It went the wrong direction. Oh. No. It always is something a little bit wrong. I'm sorry. Got it. It went the wrong direction.


Yeah. Supposed to go up, not down. Yeah. It's probably my fault. I probably didn't specify exactly everything. Okay. From July 10th to present, that was what I said.


Yeah. I just want to confirm that it didn't do these latest. July 10th. So July 10th it did. There's all the receipts.


Yeah. went back. Yeah. back. Yeah. Thank you very Thank you very Thank you so for joining us today. Thank you.


Thank Thank you. Thank you. Shall we go out of my order now? Thank you very your call has been forwarded to voice


ACTION ITEM
Audit portable toilet invoices; confirm monthly charges and gaps
Thank you. Thank Hey, I'm like auditing all of the past invoices and then these like portal potties, how are they charges?


Monthly. Monthly? Yeah. Okay, because it doesn't look like I'm getting monthly invoices, looks like there's a gap between them.


It looks like there's a couple months in between the invoices every time they charge. How much is it a month?


It's like 180 something a month, I think it is. 184.38, right? Yeah. Yeah. And then whatever the start date is, there's the drop off charge, right?


And then the end. Yeah, it's a reoccurring like, I don't know, it was like a net 30 days or something like that.


It doesn't charge like every month on the same day. know what mean? So whatever, whatever it is from start to beginning, every single invoice is downloaded for that.


So if there's a gap in between it, that's whatever is charged for the project. Okay. Well, I'm just going through like, if you're looking at it and you're wondering why it's not like on the 20th of every month, that's not how they charge it.


Well, I'm like, I'm getting a gap from like September to like December. So I'm how they're charging. Does that make sense?


Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, if I don't have an invoice for it, then they didn't charge me for the bill jumped over to the next month.


What? I mean, I'm not even saying next month. That's like three months. That's weird. Yeah, well, I'll go through it.


But so it's I see it 184, 184, 38 each month. Yeah. So it's a monthly charge. All right. OK.


And that's all the question. Hey, I emailed you the bid for Daniel. Do you see it? Yeah, I did see it.


What are you thinking? Give me feedback. It's very raw. It's just phase one. it's kind of like just a layout.


There's no details as to the structural and the footing and foundation to be performed. I can go off of that and come up with a quote for that.


ACTION ITEM
Email Daniel Shahada re: bid clarifications; CC Liam
But there is something that I need to get clarification on. So I'll send you an email so that way you can discuss with him.


Or did you want me to email directly? exactly. Yes, Exactly. Yes, All sûr Absolutely. Or should I put it in like a?


Yeah, put CC everybody together, ask them the questions, then put me in it, and just say you're a part of Ascension Capital, you're Liam's partner.


Yeah, who should I be addressing? What was his name? His name is Daniel, and you'll see it on his tag, Daniel Shahada.


Okay, yeah, so then I'll just email him directly, and then CC you as well. Yeah. You want me to CC MP too?


No, you don't have to, just me and you right now, but obviously MP is going to know what's going on too.


Yeah. Alright? Yep. Cool, let me know. Yeah. Alright, bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Thanks. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.


Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. So seeing as Ryan now, I was wondering, should I jump in on some of them and we do two in time?


No. Let's just go one by one. Okay. I was just making sure that they're right, but are they entering right now?


Yeah. Okay. Just wait. The... Yeah. That's on refund detection. Yeah. There was already refund detection logic, but it didn't detect the negative.


So I just added that in. Okay. Are your sales for Infinity Vault? Yeah. Okay. I had to turn off the ads and go back and break even pricing, but they're still selling with that.


So that's good. You're selling, but you're not making money? Are breaking even? It's like a little bit in the positive now, 5% in the positive, so a little bit about breaking.


It's not to survive. No. Yeah. No, just cash coming in. I'm making money. I'm going to be making money now from software.


So. So. Um. So. So, so. Um, so. No, get that, but you still have a business, so... Yeah, and I need to place an order soon, so I have to get that figured out.


But I'm to just sprint to bring in money so that I can play... Like, I literally just need, like, 2,000 credit on my credit card so I can place that order in the next week or so, but I'll it out.


But, yeah, if I miss it, I miss it, and then whatever. But, like, yeah, I'm just going hard at the software.


Business, well, basically business consulting also. I might have a potential good job offer at CoStar. Someone reached out today who...


I like the previous manager, but she asked me to apply for that specific job and I already had a phone screen with them.


I think I have a feeling they talked. I told the guy today, was like, because another guy was saying his situation and I was saying mine and it's like, I don't want to do a full-time job, but if I have to, then I will.


I'm also considering hanging out Christmas tree lights during the season to just bring in some more cash. My uncle showed me how to pay the other day.


I thought you had a job right now. Yeah, but it takes like a week to get paid, so I usually end up prior to any other stuff.


And like Christmas tree lights, I get paid the same day. And it could be more. Per hour than the $50 an hour job.


Thank you very much. Do you think first quarter next year you'll have a gate or what are you going to do with the infinity vault?


Yeah, okay. I have a call tonight with essentially a new team to manage stuff, but I do have to pay them, so that's kind of blocking it.


But it's only 500 bucks a month. Correct me or wrong, you're struggling to find work to keep out payments for a business that's not making money.


Yeah, you got to keep up with all these building expenses and ordering, and the business is not generating enough revenue, so you're working to feed.


Yeah, but the profitability is increasing. it's hard to gauge like it's going from negative to free given to positive.


So it's tough to justify giving it up basically, but we can't place the order of them. The emails should be sent.


The 20 emails since July should be sent now. Let me, I'll figure this out. I'm going to heat up my food.


I'm to heat up my food. I'm to up my food. I'm going to heat up my food. You Thank you.


Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Did you tell Coach why you're not interested in the potential?


The what? The Apple job. You should talk to about that. I told them I'm not interested in learning. Yeah, you should communicate.


Like give them an answer. I did yesterday. I'm interested. Yeah. you. you. Thank Finally, it took me well enough.


Did you guys talk? No, but I talk to him every day. I'm close to him. Yeah, mean, we were childhood friends and we just got close again.


This is our season in Miami. My kids are close. I trained on pickleball. I trained Virginia in pickleball. They got me a bunch of coaching gigs, so I coach for money in pickleball now.


It's crazy. Yeah, but we have good people and if you don't want potential, just communicate. But they'll help. They'll always reach out to their networks.


Yeah, I was considering it and that's why I didn't get back because I was thinking about it and then, you know, thought about it.


I was away on the road trip. What's the ROI on Apple job? 200k a year maybe? A little less?


Oh. was. That's pretty good. Do you think it's in the 300 ranges? I was thinking like less than 200.


It depends like what they put me at. Maybe I'm just inflated today because someone reached out to me saying that they asked if I was interested in a staff engineer job, which is like one of the higher level ones that I even know I'd be considered for.


But it kind of makes sense when I think about it. So if I was considered one of those, then it would be closer to that range.


But I was getting paid $240 when I left, total compensation. $240 right now, what do you live? Pretty mental peace?


Yeah, it would, but I still think that it's not as high a leverage. It's not a prison sentence. You don't have to do $240 for 10 decades, right?


You can do $240 for two years. Yeah. And one of the guys that I'm working with that's full-time job, so it wouldn't be the worst thing in the world.


No. We'd still move forward because there's four of us, and these dudes are powerhouses. Like, we move forward every single day.


Good. In big ways, so like, yeah. I do need to keep moving forward the job because there's two things that I need to follow up on right now.


Just update my resume and send it to people. One's a Disney opportunity, and one's CoStar, and then another one, follow-up on, is Blast of Zorbex.


He emailed me out before Thanksgiving. Not emailed back, but I haven't heard from him. Sorry, it ran through the bottom again.


Are serious? Yeah. didn't go through the top, though, or did it? Looks like that one did. Didn't run through the air.


The reason why I know know... Oh yeah, well I had it clear everything and then run through everything again.


Okay, so it ran through everything. I told it to clear everything and then just run through July to present, so it seems like it just did everything.


Yeah, 17 minutes ago. It just keeps running through it. Look, 17 minutes ago, 23 minutes ago, so five minutes later I ran through it again.


Yeah, but I did rerun it a few times myself. It's not like stuck in a loop. Okay. So clear these out, all right, and then start fresh when we're tuned.


Yeah, I had it run through all the ones from July onwards because now that it has the refund logic.


Hopefully we can see it get that right, but this is the wrong one, yeah, this one, the latest. Two receipts, so something's off, right?


I don't know if it's automation or actuals. Okay. 7252, right? And then she looked right down for me. Okay.


Okay. Okay. Thank you. Thank you. you. Thank you. you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. you. Thank I have a breakdown, so let's go down here, 725273, but they're adding 638373, let's add these receipts.


Right off the bat, he's missing this. 268, there's a missing one receipt. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7.


It's missing one receipt. There's 7 receipts there, and then 6 there. All right, let's do this. 452, 4, you see that anywhere?


Yeah, I see that. 452. 486. 452. 452. 486. C3? Got it. Oh, I can't read this. Yep. Is there a problem?


So let me, yeah, let me write that now. 1134? Yeah. And it's a picture of a receipt, right? It's a picture we see.


Cool. That's what we want, identify the problems. Okay. Well done. in. Well I'm going bring the food in here, because I don't have much time, so let's try to knock this out before I have to go get the kids.


I haven't, so, yeah, close to four. Thank you. Thank Thank you. Thank you. Thank Thank Thank you. Thank you.


Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. you. you. Thank Thank you. you. Thank you. Thank you.


ACTION ITEM
Fix OCR for photo receipts; re-run Walnut Jul 10–present; then run Woodbury
you. Thank you. You Thank you. So how are you able to remedy that, the picture receipts? I'll look into it and I'll try it, yeah, figure it out.


Last time we had to use some... ... ... ... What it call? I know Carlos was working on that problem.


Yeah, the OCR. I do have OCR implemented. So I didn't read it. Yep. No problem. 1135. That's I need.


1135, trim work, materials 32, 63, 1455. Bingo. Easy. Easy invoices, they get it. Like, I'm not saying they. Your automation gets it.


The team of AI engineers. The battalion of AI engineers. Materials 298704. Correct. Receipts. 3913, 713, 62, 2611, 26. Oh, they didn't catch the refund thing again.


Negative total, or is it? Yeah, it should be negative 386, 27. Yeah, it's the same thing. So what's 1135?


Yeah, the same one. I thought you solved it. The logic. Well, I gave it a first pass, but... See it?


Yeah. Kimberly wrote it down for me. The invoice says it. 1170, not 1135. 1170. Okay. So here, yeah. The invoice says it too.


The invoice says it. We should always do that. No, not always. But... In the notes, kind of sometimes when she has time, she breaks it down for me and makes it my life simple, but your automation caught it as an addition.


I think it would help if I have access your email again. Okay. If I don't work through these issues.


That's fine. So how much time are you going to have time to commit to this? Let's talk to you, right?


Yeah. mean, without getting paid for it, I'll just do it when I can here tonight. Okay. But I can't really make promises on one.


But I want to get your business just upgraded with stuff. Like the general goal of that. I mean. Yeah.


It's hard for me to give you big goals if you can't finish small goals. Let's take it one step at a time.


We're getting way advanced here. This thing has cost us, what, six months, right? I mean, I haven't even been completed.


Also, what does completed mean? Because their goal is to save you time and effort. Yeah, it hasn't really saved me any time or effort.


It's breaking. It's not a working product, bro. You know what mean? Like, it just breaks or there's always issues.


And it's not like you're not trying. It's just you're everywhere. Well, it's not going to be perfect also. And it needs to, the goal is to save you time.


If it's not doing that, if it needs to be 100% correct for it to save you time, then we need to get it 100% correct.


But I just want to make sure that we keep in mind, like, how can we... Save your time because you need to go to some other stuff.


You shouldn't be focused on this all the time. Well, that's fundamentally, yes, but we don't have a working automation invoice system.


Right. And it's not going I don't I don't know, like. Perfection is something that we can shoot for, but it might take forever to get the perfection.


If it can, if it can work 98 percent of the time, then if that can help save you time.


Oh, absolutely. 98 percent would be amazing. But like, I don't even think this is 98 percent. Well, how do I how do we gauge 98 percent?


Yeah, I agree with you. 98 percent. I'm happy. Yeah, I'm going to always have to look through it anyways, because I'm not going to just blindly trust it.


Yeah, especially now that you said you tell me it'll never be 100 percent. If you tell me I'll never be 100 percent, that means I can't fully trust it.


Correct. I think that's the same with ChatGPT and with all the stuff, but there are things where we can have it learn and iterate off the feedback and improve off the feedback.


This is only our first round of user testing, so I expect errors right now. Well, yeah, we're going to go through it.


That's why we're going through it. Yeah, I get it. mean, if you don't want to, you know, explore other options and stuff and other things for the overall business, because this thing is not perfect, like it's up to you.


But I just want to I just don't want you to feel like you wasted a whole lot of time with me.


So I would hope that that's not the case and we can figure out just something that. I I don't regret spending time with you and investing the time.


that get with on say it's Back that's 80 get I? it I'm really big on alignment. I'm really big on input, output.


I'm really big on results. And six months later, we still don't have a working automation. And we've changed, although we've changed many times the direction, even when we've said now that it needs to be simple, straight to the point working, we still don't have it, right?


And we're going through it now. There's a lot of bugs. And if you can solve it, great. If not, then I'm just going to have to do this the old-fashioned way and not really, rely on an automation.


Because I don't want the automation to be 50-50 and it's going to slow me down even further, right? And I'm going back and forth to you.


I'm like, why is this automation not working, right? And now I have to focus on automation on this. So it becomes like more traffic for me where I can just slowly type this in and I'm okay.


But yeah. I mean, at first, Lance, if it just works like it does and I think it'll bring me a lot of value, but can it catch negatives?


Can it catch refunds? Can it catch... Yeah, I I think we can fix that stuff for the most part.


I don't want to say, like, we can 100% fix everything without having done it yet. So I just want to paint a realistic picture, but I do think we can.


I just need to figure out how. And there might be some cases where it just needs, where the automation does get it wrong.


And then, like, that's where the human needs to step in and, like, you know, verify it. So that's kind of the, that's kind of a big problem with automating this system and this process.


Because if the human is going to need to step in and verify everything anyways, then what's the point? Cancel.


I can't sell this. If I can't use it and I can't trust it, why am I going to go to other companies and try to sell this?


Or even to my own network, right? Oh yeah, want to check this automation? Yeah, does it work all the time?


No, you still have to review everything. Why am I going to pay money for it? It doesn't make any sense.


Yeah, if it doesn't actually save your time. The whole goal is to save your time and to get things done.


How are you going to make money if you don't bring value to people? There has to be a value exchange here.


So right now there's not much of a value exchange, nothing personal. I definitely want this to work, right? I want to be able to call Billy right now and be like, hey man, this works 100%.


Save him time, save him energy because he trusts me. But I can't lie to him. What's going on with the automation thing?


I don't know, man. So then six months later and we don't have anything. So. Which. Which is unfortunate, but it is what it is.


All these little bugs. I think let's complete the testing round on everything and let's write down everything that's wrong and I'm going to get feedback from the coaches.


And I'm going to use that to cover my gaps in knowledge and then go from there. Okay, well, I'm going to go through all this.


I don't know why this one right here, I'm like, some of the stuff I can do too, like, but just help us sit down with you.


was that one? This one has like, oh, it's invoice reminder. – 24 and then 35. Deeper shots. Thank This is pretty much your first automation ever made for somebody, right?


Yeah. If I were to do it again, I would do a two to three hour call or just discovery session with you about the entire business and look for the highest and just talk about everything in the business and try and discover the highest ROI automation to build.


It doesn't help the other person. You want to find out what the biggest pain point is, not the highest ROI.


This is my worst pain point at this point. Everything else that's really hard, you can't solve for me because negotiations, going to meetings, trying to...


If companies like that, you can't solve that, right? But the only thing you can solve with automation is pretty much that can't work, pretty much.


So, okay. Well, yeah, if this is your biggest pain point and you're the highest paid person or like one of the highest paid people at the company, right, then freeing up your time will mean that you can put your efforts into growing the company, which is the highest ROI.


Well, yeah, we're a small company, but if we keep scaling, I get too busy. I would just hire somebody to do this stuff.


Right. Right now, I don't want to do that because we're not to that point. But we're kind of reached that point if we're going to swallow two or three other payrolls and pick up all these construction teams, then all this becomes way more than I can possibly handle for one person.


Yeah. But a solution exists with hiring. Someone to do it and paying them that much, right? Yeah, just a part-time assistant, right?


So automation isn't the only solution? No. If the person or the person I hire seems to be reliable and they're on point, and they're going to mess up like this automation, then why would I ever have to do an automation?


ACTION ITEM
Delete payment reminder emails from processing queue
Yep. I get it. I'll delete that because these are just payment reminders and then you don't iterate through them.


There's no name by it, right? Yeah, I ignored the reminder one. Did you delete it? These are reminders, right?


Yeah. I don't know if they're reminders. I mean, that one's not. Reminder. Reminder. Reminder. Reminder. 1173. 1173. 2279. 1175.


These are reminders, right? Yeah. I don't know if they're reminders. I mean, that one's not. Reminder. Reminder. Reminder. Reminder.


1173. 1173. 2279. 1175. Thank you. Yeah, the refund thing, that should be definitely fixable. So are you still confident that if you get it to almost perfection and it's a working product, this is something that can be plugged and played into?


Yeah, I mean, if it works, then yeah, if it works, but you know how you said like there's a database of like these tools that you could?


Well, a lot of people talk to some people about and they just need like document processing for different use cases.


So like some of the stuff that I've built can be reused for different use cases. Okay. So So like definitely.


wasn't a waste of time for me because we were trying to figure out a problem. Yeah. And now I'll be able to be like, Hey, I built this, like I can work on your thing and probably get paid for working on another one.


Like I said, I don't want to just leave this where it doesn't give you any value. So I want to see this through.


Yeah, we love that because the whole I mean, the whole point of this was to share this and advertise and sell it.


Right. Yeah. I mean, that's the only reason why I sat with you for a long time, because I actually see.


And the bigger vision of like, of like, you know, being part of the revolution and like making money from selling, you know.


So. So. So basically software, like with the new AI tools and, you know, take advantage of the AI revolution.


Yeah, I mean, it's grand idea, but there's a difference between dreams and reality, right? So we tried to make this a reality that seems like it's becoming a big chore.


I would love it. So if we can just focus on like all these little problems. If I have a working product of 98% and it works 98% of the time, I would dare take a risk.


I'm like, hey, this automation actually works. But if this thing keeps breaking or I just have to do double work because I got to check my automation and then check my invoicing, like I don't really have a solution.


I have a bigger problem, right? I have an extended problem. Now it's just causing me more time. And I'd be like, this.


I'll just do it the old-fashioned way. Or hire somebody. I'm gonna leave it up to you to think that you can solve this or not.


Is it solvable? Is it? And maybe something is always solvable, but the more important question is, do you have the time and energy to solve it?


And do you think it's worth your time and energy to solve it? Yeah, that's the practical question. Like, do you think you solving this, having a working product, you will monetize from my relationships and your relationships with, hey, I did this?


Yeah, for sure. If it's working, once we get it working, yeah. Well, then if you really believe that, then that should be your certification, right?


Yep. Because I'm not gonna hound you. And after today, I really got to clear these damn voices. Can't wait for these, this automation.


Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, I mean, even if it worked 100%, I don't know, I guess if worked 100%, it would help me move faster.


For sure it would. I would. I don't You would just take a look at five of them and be like, okay, everyone worked, and I'm just going keep going and using automation.


No, actually, I would go through All Walnut, and if All Walnut worked, then I would trust the Woodbury file.


Does that make sense? Yeah. I would, I'd give myself a longer trial, not just five. Right, okay. Right? Sorry.


Yeah, I would go through All Walnut, and if it was like almost 100% or 100%, I'd be like, cool.


So just go through Woodbury now, run it. You know what mean? Yeah. Yeah. You build trust over time. You don't just, only strangers get implicit trust in the beginning.


But even then, after a few, a few actions or a choices, you'll see someone who they are. Mm-hmm. And 16.


Mm-hmm. yeah. All So, yeah, if you sign in on my computer, on your Gmail, then I can go through all of these and I can verify the refund fix and I can fix, I can work on the, is anyone on your new team as a developer like you?


Yeah, so I can recruit himself too. Yeah, well, what's his in syndication? Yeah, yeah, but like I said, I'm going to do the coaching call thing, so, and, you they're getting paid, so they're incentivized to help me come up with a good solution, and they can give me good advice on if it's doable or not, and they might have already worked with someone who's done this same thing for.


So you don't really know this is doable. Yeah. I trust that I can do it, I can get it figured out, but it's not done yet, so I don't know 100% that it's doable.


Yeah. I think it is. I'm very confident that it is, but I can't say it's not done yet. Right.


I mean, when it works, it's nice. It just seems like, you know, there's a lot of bugs, you know.


ACTION ITEM
Fix total extraction for 1173; re-run Walnut Jul 10–present; then run Woodbury
Let's go through another one. 1173, 1174. Was there an issue with 1173 automation? All right. 8960. 14, 316, 21, 217, 3, 92, 5, 9, 5, 15.


So we're off. They led 291, 14. Why did you do that? I just said 291, 14. I'll go by 35.


Oh, read 291, 14. It's supposed to be. Okay. So without the text. Yeah. be. So total text. Yeah. Okay.


Make sense? Mm-hmm. Okay. Yeah. Thank Yeah, think I could do a better job with setting the expectation, too, like before the user testing.


I think I've been through a bunch of them myself, and I've tested a bunch myself, and I obviously didn't run into these issues.


Well, you didn't run through all of them like we're doing now. Right. And I think that should always be the case, no?


That should be the process. Yeah. To what standard are we looking at here? Yeah, I should run through all of them before bringing it to to have you check it, right?


But that's hard for you because you've got a lot going on. No, but if that's the process, then that's what I should do.


mean, if it'll pay off. I'm You The, that And I should be doing that. And that's the quickest way to get myself paid.


Yeah. If you want to get paid, you've got to be good. And you have to have a high standard.


And what is a high standard? To me, I talked about this to my team and my company all the time.


The high standard is attention to detail and pursuit of excellence. Going through this one by one meticulously is a high standard.


I'm not trying to insult you or be disrespectful. But you've to answer yourself, to what standard have you been setting this?


Just this project alone. And every project that you touch, everything in your life should be a pursuit of excellence.


Yeah. And if you aren't, then maybe your output is not where you want it to be. Then you really, really need to audit your input.


Because in my company, I harp on it every day and I've argued with Billy about it. My other partner, Phillip, is on the same page.


We get better every single day and we can't just say we're better than other companies. What? Right. It's the pursuit of excellence.


Attention to detail. Right. So going one and the whole project, if you want only a couple and you think that's good enough, then that's not really a pursuit of excellence in my opinion.


So if that's not a pursuit of excellence, how do I want to invest or want to buy from you?


I don't really want to because I don't see it. The proof of work is the proof of putting, man.


So, you know, really, really ingrained that and you are trying to adopt that mindset. Yeah. I'm sorry, four. Three, nine, two, five.


Nine, two, five. five. Labor. Wow. I'm totally off on the phone. Right. Oh, yeah. We talked about this one.


Yeah. Let's go. Was that the latest analysis? Let's see. I don't know. It's good question. I think it should have done another later one.


Scroll down. No. Wait. Where is this? Yeah. It was 1174. I'm not sure why I didn't do that one.


ACTION ITEM
Ensure latest invoice instance processed; re-run Walnut Jul 10–present; then run Woodbury
1174? I didn't do it. 1174. Yeah, 1174. Yeah, 1174. 8. 127. It should be doing the latest instance of an invoice, so I'm not sure if it did that.
