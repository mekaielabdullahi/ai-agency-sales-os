## Major Topics Discussed

### 1. Pricing & Proposals
- **Phase 0 Discovery:** 10% of total project ($1.5K for $15K build)
- **Denis's 3-Phase Model:**
  - Phase 1: $15K AI Readiness (interviews, process mapping, recommendations)
  - Phase 2: $40-100K implementation
  - Phase 3: $5K/mo retainer (monitoring, optimization, partnership)
- **AriseGroup proposal:** $30K for $30M revenue company

### 2. Free vs Paid Discovery
- Liam recommends starting with **free audits** to build trust
- Alan Weiss approach: Value upfront, charge on backend
- Denis credits discovery to implementation

### 3. Technical Stack
| Tool | Use Case | Advocates |
|------|----------|-----------|
| **n8n** | Workflow automation, lower cost | Matthew, Trent, Denis |
| **Make.com** | Simpler workflows | Emma, Fabian |
| **Claude Code** | Production development | All |
| **AutoClaude** | Background autonomous builds | Matthew |
| **Notion** | CRM, project management | Trent |
| **Fathom** | Meeting recording/transcription | Denis, team |
| **Wispr Flow** | Voice dictation (127 wpm vs 40 typing) | Trent |

### 4. CRM Options
- **HubSpot:** Free tier, good integrations, feature-heavy
- **Zoho:** Inexpensive, customizable
- **Notion:** Clean but limited API
- **Google Sheets:** Simple, works for low volume
- **Monday CRM:** No free tier

### 5. AI Audit Framework (Denis's Workshop Notes)
1. Choose **MVC (Most Valuable Challenge)** worth the price alone
2. Anonymous survey: score 1-10 on happiness, downstream impact, revenue potential
3. Solo writer method: each person defines what MVC means to them
4. **Double Diamond:** Discovery → Define → Design → Deliver
5. Auctioneer method for scope selection
6. Build **alignment plan** (not action plan) for stakeholder buy-in

### 6. Sales Objection Handling
- SMBs scared of "AI taking jobs"
- Show demos, not just talk
- Denis: "Show them what they think is happening vs. what's actually happening"
- Sway's 5 Questions Close (from Otto Peterson):
  1. What's the biggest problem?
  2. What's it costing you?
  3. How long has it been like this?
  4. How will it look in 6-12 months?
  5. If you had a magic solution, what would it be?

## Sway's Sales Process Breakdown (Winning Example)

**Context:** Closed paid AI Audit with Paris firm

**Process:**
1. Met client cold at museum in Amsterdam
2. Discovery call with owner only
3. Requested group call with 4 staff members
4. Discovered entire data flow was a mess (Google Sheets chaos)
5. Partner CEO was absent - potential blocker
6. Scrapped presentation, started fresh with partner
7. Used Otto's 5 Questions framework
8. Told them flat out: "Can't give price until I see how bad the blood is"
9. Offered audit with clear deliverables they can take anywhere
10. **Result:** "Let's go!"

**Key Lessons:**
- ALWAYS talk to main decision makers
- Don't waste time with non-decision makers
- It all comes down to how much pain the client feels
