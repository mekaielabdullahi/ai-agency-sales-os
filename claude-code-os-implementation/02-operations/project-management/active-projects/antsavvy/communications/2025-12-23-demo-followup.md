Hey Christian,

Hope you're doing well heading into the holidays! Wanted to follow up on the Hidden Costs Chatbot demo I sent over.

Quick feedback request:
- Did you get a chance to try it out?
- Any initial thoughts - even small things? I can quickly iterate on any feedback (UI tweaks, different examples, etc.)
- Did you share it with anyone at AntSavvy yet?

---

**Long-Term Plan (Summary)**

Here's how I see this progressing:

**Phase 1: Hidden Costs Chatbot (CURRENT - Demo Delivered)**
- Demo built - identifies forgotten costs for event line items
- Covers 10 categories (stage, catering, venue, AV, permits, etc.)
- Prevents the $50k+ in forgotten costs per project
- Next: Get feedback, customize with AntSavvy's actual historical data

**Phase 2: Accounts Copilot (Q1 2026)**
- Chrome extension that prompts during live client calls
- Listens for line items mentioned → surfaces hidden cost checklist in real-time
- No numbers shared (addresses their data sensitivity concerns)
- Potential Blocker: Need historical project data from Trissy (real line items and hidden costs + potentially associated hidden costs)

**Phase 3: Full RAG System (Q2 2026)**
- Knowledge base with company procedures, regional permits, past project data
- Auto-generates procurement briefs from meeting transcripts
- Goal: Reduce 80-hour close process → 20 hours

---

**Outstanding from Dec 12 Meeting:**
- Historical project data (line items + hidden cost types) - needed to train the system
- Tanglish audio sample (for testing real client call processing)
- Turtle involvement (if you want him on development)

---

**My capacity right now:**
I can quickly iterate on demo feedback this week before everything slows down for the holidays. Let me know if there's anything to tweak.

Happy to hop on a quick call if easier to talk through.
