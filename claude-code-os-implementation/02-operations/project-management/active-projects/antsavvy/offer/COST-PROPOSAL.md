## Project Scope Assumptions

Based on discovery conversations and demo development:

**Assumed Use Case:**
- Accounts team needs to capture client requirements from meetings
- Requirements often get lost between client meetings and procurement
- AI assistant helps review requirements for completeness
- Manual review process still in place (AI augments, doesn't replace)

**Technical Assumptions:**
- Chatbot-based interface (as demonstrated)
- Cloud-hosted solution (no on-premise infrastructure)
- Standard web access (no special software required)
- Integration with existing workflow (minimal disruption)

**Scope Boundaries:**
- **IN SCOPE:** Requirements capture, completeness checking, workflow assistance
- **OUT OF SCOPE:** Full automation of procurement process, direct client-facing tools, complex integrations with existing systems (unless discussed)

---

## Risks & Mitigation

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| **Client feedback requires major changes** | Cap iteration time at 5 hours; additional changes = Phase 2 scope |
| **Integration complexity higher than expected** | Early technical review before deployment |
| **Training needs exceed 1 hour** | Provide documentation for self-service, offer extended training in Phase 2 |

---

## Success Metrics

**Phase 1 Success Criteria:**
- [ ] Client feedback incorporated (within scope)
- [ ] Production deployment complete
- [ ] Accounts team trained and using system
- [ ] No critical bugs or blockers
- [ ] Client satisfied with deliverable

**Business Impact (Expected):**
- Reduced requirement gaps between meetings and procurement

## Appendix: Cost Justification

### Value-Based Pricing Context

**Problem Cost (Current State):**
- Requirements getting lost = rework
- Incomplete procurement requests = delays
- Accounts team time spent chasing missing info
- Client friction from miscommunication

**Estimated Monthly Impact:**
- Even 5 hours/month saved = $200-500/month value (accounts team time)
- Reduced errors/rework = additional value
- Improved client satisfaction = relationship value

**Investment:**
- One-time: $1,000
- Potential monthly: $200-500 (optional)

**ROI:** If saves 5+ hours/month, pays for itself in 2-4 months (one-time) or immediately (ongoing)

### Pricing Comparison

**Alternatives:**
- Custom development from scratch: $5,000-15,000+
- SaaS subscription tools: $100-300/month (less customized)
- Hiring additional staff: $40,000+/year

**Our Approach:**
- Fixed-fee MVP: $1,000 (low risk, fast deployment)
- Optional ongoing support: $200-500/month (flexible)
- **Value:** Customized solution at SaaS-like pricing
