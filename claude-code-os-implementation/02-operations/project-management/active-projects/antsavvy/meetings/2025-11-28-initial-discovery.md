0:00 - Christian Marangone
  Give me one second, I'm just going to grab the one. Good. Yeah. How's your, is it, is it morning for you?

0:06 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
  How, or what, what time is it for you? Uh, 11 o'clock today.

0:10 - Christian Marangone
  So yeah. How have you been? Yeah, it's been good. So woke up, um, yeah, went, trained for a little bit, which is obviously ideal. I'm a bit suave, just started getting back into the routine of training, which is, you know, obviously great. Um, and then, all right, cool. Awesome. Uh, and then from there, what else really? It's just cleaned up the house a little bit. Um, my partner heads overseas tomorrow, so she'll be back in the Philippines for a little bit. And then, uh, I'll be here with my nan, jumped on, did, did a little bit of gaming before the fall, and then I got work this afternoon. So it's a very busy day. Nice. Cool. Cool.

0:48 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
  That's awesome.

0:51 - Christian Marangone
  Give me one second. I'm just gonna call Turtle. I'll figure out where he is. Okay. See you guys.

1:12 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
  Hopefully he's doing all right, so yeah, we just had Thanksgiving holiday yesterday, so in the United States that's just like, we just eat a bunch of food basically, so yeah. Turkey and like mac and cheese, and just, it was really good. We actually went to my parents and we had like a kind of like an early dinner, we call it, and we had like food at like 1pm, and then I tried to just not eat a crazy amount because I don't like the food coma, and I'm trying to be healthy and just like a reasonable amount each meal, you know.

2:01 - Christian Marangone
  Absolutely. Absolutely. That's the way, right? Because like, when you eat so much, you just feel so yuck by the end of it, you know what I mean? I 100% know.

2:10 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
  Like, I used to think that I, like, I've always wanted to, like, gain weight, and I used to think that I needed to eat a bunch of food at one time, but it just sent my energy, like, just all over the place. And now I really realized recently that, like, it's better to just stay even keel and just be a normal eater.

2:30 - Christian Marangone
  Absolutely. Or, like, you can just slowly increase it over time, and then, like, it goes side-by-side with your training, so that way, like, as you get heavier on the weights, and you get, like, a little bit more food into you, like, you'll be able to burn that so much easier, right? Yeah, yeah, 100%.

2:47 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
  Makes life a little bit easier.

2:49 - Christian Marangone
  I'm not sure where this dude is. I've just messaged him as well. So, fingers crossed he jumps in. He is two hours behind me, so it's 9 a.m. for him. Whether something's happened or not. Oh, there we go. He's looking at his phone now. Okay, cool. Where is he at? He's in Perth. Okay. Yeah. So I'm in Brisbane. So I'm at like the pointy bit of Australia. And then he's on like the opposite side. He's on the left hand side of Australia. So yeah, he's two hours behind me, which isn't too bad, thankfully, but makes it tricky some nights and it's like, oh, bro, like, are you on? Like, let's have a call. like, brother, it's midnight. Like, what do you mean? It's 10 p.m. Yeah. So yeah, he'll be on for two seconds. And then once that's there, we should be good to go. So yeah, man, I'm actually looking forward to this. So I've got a few ideas in mind on sort of how we can scope it out, how we can lay it out. Sort of what. What some of the backend systems are going to look like, things like that, and we'll run over all that and then maybe some ideas that we can work together as a team or how we want to go about this as well, which is really, really good. And yeah, this opportunity, it's a really, really solid one as well. Nice. Okay.

4:22 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
  Yeah. I'm excited to get into the details, but I know we don't want to do that too much until the turtle gets here. So yeah, he's a , that's all good. But I just want to say, I appreciate you finding me in the network and reaching out and then following up. Like that's, that's what I love to see. To me, that's a good indicator that like, you know, it's a real opportunity. We're going to move, we're going to be moving forward. We're going to be working on this thing, you know, consistently and delivering results at end of the day, which is what matters. So yeah, a hundred percent, man.

4:55 - Christian Marangone
  And like, at the end of the day, right, what, what I was saying to you on that initial call is that this isn't just going to be like a one and done project. So this... So is actually my partner's family's business, right? They've been operating for something like 20 years. So they're very, very new to the AI space to put it in perspective of like how new they are to the space. The director that I had a conversation with, her name is Trissie. She's used ChatGPT twice in her life. Wow.

5:23 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
  All right. Yeah. Like very, very new.

5:25 - Christian Marangone
  When they think AI, they think all AIs do the exact same thing. Whereas like when we look at it, we're like, no, you got this one, you got this one, got this one. It's like dog breeds, right? Mm-hmm.

5:36 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
  Yeah. Different AI are good at different things. So a hundred percent.

5:41 - Christian Marangone
  So, um, the opportunity there is great because we've got the knowledge. Now it just comes down into be able to provide it for them. And we'll run over some of the details of like where they're sitting and stuff like that. Turtle lad, what's doing, bro?

5:58 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
  I got a little bit drunk at the Christmas party.

6:01 - Joshua McCrystal
  Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. a feeling, bro.

6:03 - Christian Marangone
  Hey, all right? Yeah. Easy, easy. Cool. Well, Turtle, this is Matthew. Matthew, is my boy Turtle. You can call him Josh if you want. Completely up to you. I've just known him like that for a while now. Cool. Good to meet you.

6:18 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
  Yeah, whatever you want to go by, you know, I call you Turtle. Ah, yeah, I'm not fussed either way.

6:24 - Joshua McCrystal
  I'll respond to both. Good to finally meet you. Charmy's been talking up a storm about you. Sounds good.

6:32 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
  Yeah, I go on the same like Matthew or Matt is either way is fine. I usually like Matthew, but it doesn't really either way. doesn't matter to me. Yeah.

6:44 - Joshua McCrystal
  Too easy. Crazy. Easy as.

6:47 - Christian Marangone
  So, look, I think just to kick things off, just to sort of like ensure that everyone knows where they're sitting, what we'll do is we'll just do like a small little self introduction. Obviously, we all sort of know each other from our own spaces and sort of like what everyone's about. But I think this way we can all get. to know each other a little bit more personally whilst also understanding the business side of it. So I'll kick it off in that respect. I'm Christian or Charmy as Turtle Nose Meows. So for me, I've worked in sales the last five years, which is pretty much my entire adult life. I'm currently working with a handful of really, really big teams, one being Oxygen Gyms based out of Dubai in the UAE. We're going to be opening up a branch here and sort of, you know, obviously with us meeting in the network, Matt. Now it's transitioning more into running a business, which just happens to be an AI. But the biggest goal for me is realistically providing value to businesses whilst also, you know, being able to help as many people as possible. So with my career through sales, getting to Oxygen Gyms wasn't an easy feat by any means. I've done door knocking. I've done standing at shopping centres and telling people to sign up to charities. I've done cold calling and I've done fitness sales for a vast majority of my time. With the time that I have been working in the fitness sales, I've been the top of form up for maybe two-thirds of that period of time. So yeah, that's me. That's a little bit of what I'm about. Matthew, do want to go next, man? Cool. Yeah.

8:16 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
  So my name is Matthew. I started my career, so I worked at Amazon.com for six years as a professional software development engineer. And so in that time, I learned the ropes from a lot of really smart people. The whole time I was there, was surrounded by people smarter than me. And they focused intensely on best practices. And I learned a lot. Just every code review for the first three years was like, there's something wrong. There's something I didn't do quite right, which built a bit of a thick skin. And at the end of the day, what really helped was self-study. And then I learned... So a lot of things through just reading a few books that I really like and got to the next level and then, you know, started doing more high level stuff at the company, just like design reviews, which nowadays we can do pretty quickly with CloudCode, but we do need to make sure that we're detailed and like ask the right questions, dig in, and don't just trust it blindly because that will just lead to more time spent down the line. So I have a lot of opinions about best practices and stuff, but my, I've also created some documentation around this stuff that I use as like a reference when I'm working on things. But I guess more about me. So about three years ago, I left that job and started e-commerce business. So I have my e-commerce business that I'm also looking to automate. with with With AI and stuff, like workflows, and recently started down this path of AI Automation Agency, so right now I'm building out some systems of the development process, so really honing in on how we can systematize everything to make development as efficient as possible, and also make sure we maintain the high-quality bar and just, like, really think about how we're doing things, and yeah, it's all really fascinating stuff for me, so yeah, I guess that's about me. I like to play basketball, I like to go on walks, and I enjoy running, which not everyone does, but it's cool, and I've been cooking more, and yeah, I guess that's enough about me, but... or is he the turtle lad?

11:03 - Christian Marangone
  Yeah, my name's Joshua.

11:04 - Joshua McCrystal
  I don't like running. I started sort of my software engineering programming sort of hobby about maybe seven years ago. The first thing I did was made a Discord bot. And when it finally started working and doing the things I told it to do, I was like, wow, this is awesome. I can I love programming. What the hell? And so then I went and got a uni degree and I finished that mid of this year. So I'm a certified Bachelor of Computer Science majoring in software engineering. And I landed a graduate position at Cache Converters. And I've been there for the past about six months now. And like you were saying, Matthew, you learn a lot from Cache People that are much smarter than you. Every code review. So you get back, there's always something that's wrong, even though you're like, oh, this one's perfect. And they go, no, no, don't do it that way. Yeah. But yeah, it's really good. It's like I'm learning heaps from them. And it's a great company in general. So they're not making it like they don't make you feel stupid for it, which is good. But yeah, and then obviously the AI bubble has blown up and AI is on everyone's mind. And I've been playing around with that. And just like you, Matthew, I believe that you have to use it in a certain way. can't just, you know, go, hey, make this and then take whatever it spits out. You need to sort of guide it, hold its hand. And you still need to have that knowledge of what do you actually want to do? What questions do I need to ask it for it to do the right thing? Otherwise, you just end up with... And then you have a system that you think is great, and it gets hacked, and it's got vulnerabilities and whatever else. So you definitely have to know your stuff. But yeah, I'm really excited. Charmy sort of, he was chewing my ear off being like, oh, mate, this is a great idea, this, that. And I was like, yeah, I don't know. And then the more he kept talking about it, was like, you know what, I think you might actually be on to something. And yeah, he's just been getting me real hyped and excited. So I'm, I'm happy to join the team. And I'm really excited to work with you, Matthew. think I'll learn a lot from you as well. Awesome.

13:39 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
  Yeah, I love it. Crazy.

13:42 - Christian Marangone
  So, look, regarding the project, I just had a very quick chat with him about, about this just before Turtle. But I'll essentially run over the overview, what some of the backend systems we're going to need, what's going to look like. So this project, I've actually, real fancy today, we've got a whole lot of cardboard, so. So we've some bits and pieces that we're going to be operating around, right? So I can't really move too much further forward until this call, which is great. I've had multiple chats with Otto, I've had chats with Richard, and we've really, really refined down into what we're going to be building out. So to give you guys some context, the business that we're to be building for is called Ant Savvy. They're a Filipino marketing and fabrication company. They do it for a whole range of clients, but this isn't like your typical digital marketing agency, right? We're talking like these guys do things from basic digital marketing all the way through to developing large scale concerts. And we're not talking about for just general, you know, like, oh, Bob's mom and dad's fish shop down the road. We're talking for big international blue chip clients, right? We're talking like Amazon Prime. We're talking Coca-Cola. We're we're talking big echelon clients. And And some of these projects have budgets of, you know, one to 2 million USD. However, they do also take on smaller clientele that, you know, let's say their budget is 5, 10, 20,000 USD for a project. So sort of giving you guys the scope of what it is to look like, right? If we're having a look at their averages for their projects, right? Your small is going to be looking anywhere from 5,000 USD to 100,000 USD, right? As a budget. Your medium is looking 125 through to, you know, maybe let's say 400,000 USD. And then your large scale ones are looking 500,000 to north of a couple million USD as a budget per project, right? Now, the issue that we're facing with Ansavvy right now is one, everything's really messy. Two, there's been a lot of trust lost in... In a fair few areas of the business, so right here, we've sort of scoped out what the initial process was and what we want to be building to solve some of these issues that they're facing. So this is the initial process right here. I'll explain it for you, right? Let's say that we have a client that comes to the business and says, hey, I want to get this done, right? The client is going to be talking with the accounts team, and these guys are going to be talking back and forth, back and forth, back and forth for a while, right, until they can work out what the budget looks like, right? Now, this conversation here, just figuring out what the budget is and what they need, is looking at about 16 work hours worth of time. It's a long period, right? From there, once they've sort of got a general idea of what it looks like, the accounts team is now going to be conversating with procurement and implementation, right, to sort of look at like, all right, cool, where are we going to delegate these resources? How's it going How we going to implement it? What, you know, sort of permits, what's this, what's that that we need, right? And this conversation here, right, between, and mind you, these are all different departments of the business, right? The conversation between these three different departments is going to be about 24 hours worth of work time, right? Once they've sort of, generally speaking, got that nailed in, procurements, they're going to be talking with the suppliers and contractors, working out budgets, working out transits and logistics, things, so on, so forth. Right? What the materials are going look like. These conversations, because obviously these guys run their own business, that's another 30 hours, right? From there, once these guys have got their numbers down, they're going to send it through to the accounts team to add it into the budget. And once this entire process is done, which is already 60 hours worth of work time, they're then going to compile that into an email, which is going to get sent out to finance. Finance manage everything, right? They literally manage everything. And it's not just this one, Section of the business, right? They're managing all of this plus another 11 sub-businesses underneath and savvy, right? So by the time that they get this, finance have the final say of a yes, a no, or this needs to be revised and looked at, and we need to come back to it, which is then going to add on additional time, right? Yep.

18:21 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
  Cool.

18:22 - Christian Marangone
  Once they finally get the yes, finance is now going to have full contact with the clientele and all this gets wiped away. Does that sort of make sense? Yep. Total, you following? Yep. Cool. Here's a couple issues that we found with this system. One, you're looking at about 80 hours, right? Give or take. You're looking at 80 hours to  around and get this system done, right? It's all manually done. There's no automation. There's no AI used. It's just a  around in and of itself. Second thing, right? Once- This entire pitch is done for the 80 hours. Let's say, let's say that it comes down to, you know, a budget of $200,000, right? That's what the budget works out to be is 200k. So this process is taking 80 hours. Let's round it out to two weeks, right? So we're looking at two weeks to get $200,000, which doesn't sound bad on paper, right? But then you've also got to take into consideration overheads, X, Y, Z, you know, costs of, you know, the people working, all these things. It actually doesn't work out to be a lot of money, right? In retrospect. But the other thing that then comes into the issue that I've already found, right, is now we're also relying on so much manual labor. What happens with manual labor when it comes to human? We have human errors, right? Errors either cost time or they cost money or they cost both. There's no in-between on that. That's just the reality of the situation. The other issue which I've spoken with the director about is... People sometimes cut costs to ensure that it fits inside the budget, which then resolves in the company taking a loss hands down. There's no, there's no if, buts or maybes in between there. So what I've got up here, you'll see a little circle, the slash on the 5k, right? Essentially what that represents is let's say that, you know, one of the people in accounts, they go, okay, well, look, this contractor is charging an additional 5k. I forgot about that, or I didn't include that in the budget. Let's just cut it. Let's just make sure that that just counts zero is just a one off for them. But then we've got a little X10 here. So then that works out to be 5k times 10. You're looking at 50k right there. So now you're minus 50k, which is then turning technically the budget into 250k of a budget, but the business is only budgeted for 200k. But because of that loss of information and because of the loss of, I guess, reasoning and not asking the questions that needed to be off. Now the business is taking a loss. you can see all the  ups that are happening here. It's a long process. There's a lot of human error.

21:12 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
  Sorry, I have a quick question because I think I didn't fully understand that part and I just want to make sure I get it. So the 5k that you're talking about is basically human errors that cost money or time and then basically people will cut costs to fit inside the budget. heard that part right before you started talking about this. And then what was the bridge? What happens? What is this 5k coming from that gets multiplied by 10? Yeah, absolutely.

21:43 - Christian Marangone
  So the 5k, let's just say it's suppliers and contractors or let's say it's someone in accounts that didn't ask the right question or didn't relay the information that the client wanted this, right? Let me tell you on the slide. Okay. So let's say, just as an idea, right? Let's say the client wants to build out a concept. it. Please Please Just Then if that costs it, they want a food truck, but the accounts team forgot to put the food truck into the budget, so now what they're going to do is they're going to cut the cost of the food truck, they're not going to charge for the food truck, and they're still going to provide it, but that food truck costs $10,000, or sorry, $5,000, right? Are you following where I'm going with this?

22:22 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
  So why wasn't it included again? Because they forgot, it's human error.

22:27 - Christian Marangone
  Okay. Yeah. So now let's say that per project, generally speaking, right, we have 10 of those -ups, which is obviously a very grand number, but this is just for the sake of the reasoning, right? Let's say there's 10 of those -ups, right? That takes it from 10 5k's, which works out to be 50k. Yep. Got it. Yep. Following? Perfect. So now, even though we've got a 200k budget, it's costing the business 250k, so they're actually losing money in a lot of these projects just simply because there's human -ups, right? And it is what it is, right? think too terrestrial, Hey. Hey! This So the idea that we've come with to sort of fix this, right, is what we're going to do is the clients are going to, instead of having these three  around, we're essentially going to compartmentalize this into one big chunk here. So the clients talk to the accounts team, the accounts team, we're going to have fireflies or, you know, Fathom, whichever one works. better included onto that, so that way no information gets lost in the conversation and everyone can look back and revise over it, right, and that way the AI can pick up everything, then that already removes human error. The second thing is the procurement and implementation team, look, the implementation team, they were a whole department, they've actually been slashed, they're down to one or two people now, which is great. We're going to compartmentalize this into one chunk. So once the account team is. It's done with the video call. Everyone that needs to receive the email right away is going to get that email based upon their information that they need to look after in their department. Does that make sense?

24:14 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
  So is it because the note taker is in the meeting and then does the next team just get those meeting notes right away or like because I feel like there's still might be some back and forth that needs to happen just because we're introducing a note taker doesn't necessarily mean it's only one meeting now. No, of course not. Absolutely not.

24:35 - Christian Marangone
  There'll still be conversations between the departments, right? But this is just a very simplified sort of overview of like what it's going to look like. Okay. Okay.

24:43 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
  Perfect. So these guys are all going to come down.

24:46 - Christian Marangone
  They're going to figure out their costing and we're going to slash that time down from let's say 30 to 60 hours down to let's say eight, including all the conversations that they need to have, right? Once everyone's got their bits and pieces sorted, they're going to shoot it off to finance and the suppliers and contractors. From there, clients will only talk with finance and finance will talk with contractors. So that way, there's less multiple back and forth communications for information to get lost, right? And it's all run through the finance team once it gets approved, done and dusted. Okay. Cool. Okay. Now, I've worked with Richard on this to really ensure on what it looks like. And this is going to be a little bit more down your guys sort of alley to help understand what this flow is going to look like. So up here, there's a  little diagram of what I kind of want it to look like. However, if you've got any additional feedback or ideas that we can implement to make it look a little bit different or maybe run a bit smoother, we can definitely run through that. So up here, you've got a little seed, right? So this is the client. The client is going to have their meeting with the accounts team. Right? The accounts team is going to get all the information. So, Matthew, do you want to give a very simple overview of what a RAG system does?

26:24 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
  So, a RAG system is just retrieval augmented generation. So, basically, instead of just raw ChatGBT that only pulls from its training data or any context that you feed it right there in the session, a RAG chatbot can basically, you can instrument it with a knowledge base of, like, specific knowledge that you wire up. And it will take that into its context when it's generating responses. Right.

26:58 - Joshua McCrystal
  So, essentially, providing it... Context, sort of like an instruction set when you have like those real basic chatbots. Yeah, exactly.

27:12 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
  And it can be like from a full database, basically, like a vector database.

27:18 - Joshua McCrystal
  Yeah. Cool.

27:21 - Christian Marangone
  So we'll run that information through the RAG system. The RAG system will now output three sets of data, right? The three data sets are dependent on what area of the business needs to look at it, right? So data set one, right? So information set one, data set one is going to go to the accounts team, right? And then they're going to have a little chunk of what they need to look at and what needs to get done, right? And they're going to focus on their set of data. Data set two is going to come down to the procurement team, right? Again, same thing. They focus on what they need to focus on. Data set three is going to come down to the implementation squad. Right? Once that's done, they're going to funnel. So all that information into one big email that gets sent off to finance. So that way, then they have the final say. To give you guys a little bit of a scope of like what the information we need to be looking at for this RAG system, they've actually supplied me with their personal checklist, as well as that with the personal checklist. We've also got, oh, let me refresh that. We've also got some examples that we can use for it too, which is great of previous... Okay, hold up. Let me pull this back up. Give me one second. Let me just do this. Where am I looking? Let me just pull this up. Give me one sec, guys. No worries. Where am I looking? Where am I looking? Where's Yain? There we go. Bang. That's what we want right there. So this checklist is an overview of what they need and what they use when they're budgeting or, you know, getting everything ready for a project. So let me move this out the way and I'll just make sure that we've got everything there. Which one was it? This one? All right, perfect. Here we go. This is what we're looking for. Now we're cooking with gas. Cool. So they're still using Google Sheets. Okay. It's, yeah, when I say they really don't use AI at all, they really don't use AI at all. So this is the general checklist of sort of what they go over, right? And what it, what it looks  So here we go, got pre-event expenses, the venue, you know, staging, roofing, venue styling, right, technicalities, and we got some small descriptions of it, right, so what we can do with the RAG system is we can train it based upon, you know, these sets of data, right, and what it needs to be looking for, we can also, if it's an opportunity, maybe pump out some like recommendations for it, but you know, if we want to do that down the track, once we've got some more to work with, or if it's just a, you a bit hefty to do up front, that's fine as well, and as well as that, if we have a look here, these are some previous training sets that we can train it on, so this one was for Coca-Cola back in 24, so yeah, you got different, I don't know what they've done with this, I'll need to have a look at this, but there we go, participants, things like that, what it looks like, I'll have to re-go over this and ensure I've got all the right data added in there, it seems to have like  This is sort of like event planning data from the past. So that's some data sets that we can use to work on it for. But there's a few areas that we will need to get some additional information for. For example, right, because depending on where they are. So if we're thinking the Philippines, I'm going to use two areas as a bit of an idea, right? Area number one is called Shargao. Shargao is a small island. It's a very touristy island. And the other place that I'm going to use is called Manila. Manila is like the main capital city. It's the Sydney of the Philippines, right? That's the best way to envision it. So you're going to have different requirements, different permits and different legislation for Shargao than you will for Manila. Yep.

31:58 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
  Right. So that's the other thing that we do need to take into consideration.

32:01 - Christian Marangone
  Right. The different permits are going to be required, but we can definitely train the tool to be like, look, we recommend this, this, this, this, however, just check over these, right? Just as the idea. But that's essentially the idea that I have for right now, that with maybe some automated systems such as emails or email templates, that's sort of where I'm thinking for right now to where we can cut down some of the time and cut down some of the, some of the mankind. And if we can, you know, just for the sake of the argument, cut this down from, let's say 80 hours or two weeks to sign a client, and we cut that down to 20 hours or three days to sign a client, we're already not only saving them time and effort, but we're quadrupling their revenue on paper. Yeah.

32:51 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
  Fantastic. Amazing.

32:53 - Christian Marangone
  So that's the sort of, that's the idea. That's the vision. That's, that's the perspective with the limited amount of information that I do have respectively. Right? That's what's running through my mind. Right? Okay. How does that sort of sound? What, what are we thinking?

33:09 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
  Yeah. Um, so my main thing is what I'm thinking is like for the rag chat bot, um, like, are we thinking there's gonna be one chat bot or is there gonna be one sort of, uh, agent per department or is it gonna be broken down further to different roles and responsibilities with like a multi-agent system. But I think that's maybe something for a bit later. I wonder if like, um, I'm just wondering, like, what data do we have access to that we're going to feed to the chat bot? So I know you went over, um, a bunch of that already, but like, I guess I'm wondering, like, how much information can we feed to the chat bot? Like, especially around, um, different, different. And we actually, like the AI solution that we build still needs the right inputs per region. And like, what is the updated legal requirement per region? So that could get complex pretty quick. Yeah, absolutely.

34:29 - Christian Marangone
  So with that, like, for starters, I just want to touch on the first one that you mentioned, I'm thinking just initially right now, we just have one main chatbot, right? One, one basic system that just pumps out either data set one, data set two, data set three, right? Just to start with, this is this right now is about getting the quick wins, right? It's just about developing where we can get a quick win in and we can provide value early from there. That's when we can really start looking at developing those very, very complex systems, even a custom system for them. To where we can bring in some of those additional big bucks. If you think it might be easier to set up three small systems, one for each department, I'd be happy to go down that route too. I guess it just depends on one timeframe to overall cost of it, right?

35:21 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
  Yeah, I think definitely we want to focus on the quick wins and the phased approach. Because like, there's a lot that if they're a business that hasn't used AI at all, like literally just plugging in a single AI, like the simplest thing we can do, and just thinking about a little bit can provide some quick wins. I just want to make sure that we are also planning for the phased approach. But yeah, we'll what we can do is like, plan out the bigger vision, get a good feel of the problem space, and, you know, start to lay out a... Step one, step two, step three, step four, and, like, really dial into, like, okay, what are we delivering the first round? Like, what's the quickest, what's the best way we can eliminate that human error early? And then there's always going to be ideas of, like, you know, more things we can do, more complexity we can introduce, but we definitely don't want to introduce complexity, like we want to reduce complexity.

36:32 - Christian Marangone
  So, of course, absolutely, you know, especially for these guys as well, just in that early stage, right, to where it's just like, look, cool, this is it, this is what it does, right, use it, we're good to go, right? Yeah. Yep. Okay, so with that idea, then, what are you sort of thinking? What's running through your mind with it, right? Do you think just having the one initial chatbot that spits out three data sets, or are thinking just have one for each department?

37:07 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
  So, I mean, if we had one chatbot per department, it would basically, like, have, each one would have its own knowledge base. But what we can do is we can, like, I'm working on this one project right now that it's, I haven't fully tested this part, but we have designed it where it's supposed to reference only certain pieces based on the user query. So, like, if we have finance based queries, or if we have, like, accounts based questions that come into the chatbot, it should be able to handle and reference the right knowledge base, the right section of the knowledge base to fulfill. So, thank The query. There's, like, ideally, in software, you don't want to, like, merge everything together. But I think that, like, the level that AI is at, it can actually produce some reasonably good outputs, even if you do that, which, again, is not ideal, but we can improve the quality of stuff later, and just get focused on the sequence.

38:26 - Christian Marangone
  Absolutely, absolutely. So, Toto, are you still following? Yes. Okay. Cool. Do you have any questions, Ray?

38:37 - Joshua McCrystal
  Not at the moment. think it's, like, obviously, the only questions would be related to any information we're already missing, so that's fine. Yeah, I mean, the idea is fairly straightforward. You know, feed this AI agent some input from their initial meeting, and essentially now they get their output a lot quicker. Yeah, Obviously, the technicals for making sure it can understand the input we give it and refining the output to be what they expect, and obviously, you know, as correct as possible and stuff like that, will require a bit of tinkering and playing around with, but, I mean, yeah, AI is pretty capable nowadays for pretty simple stuff like that. Yeah, for sure, for sure.

39:30 - Christian Marangone
  So, look, I guess really just like, I want to ensure that like, for today, we can really refine like, exactly what we're going to do, what the steps are going to look like, timeframe and potential costs as well. Because time kills all deals, right? We've got them hot right now. So I want to ensure that we can smash this out as best as possible. In your mind, Matthew, right? What are going to be our next steps moving forward? How much of this can we can we get put? What's the general cost going to look like? Obviously, technical inspiration yourself, but also the tools, right? And where do you want to sort of go from here, right? Because I can vision things out, I can sell things, right? But in terms of tinkering and all the back-end stuff, this is primarily going to fall on both of you boys, right?

40:21 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
  Yeah, think, like, yeah, 100%. I think that we need some sort of, like, example paper trail of, like, okay, like, they, you know, this report went from accounts to the procurement or, like, the next stage. And, like, I want, like, an example of, like, all the paper trail. If we have that. If we don't have that, we can talk about me three seconds.

40:53 - Christian Marangone
  We'll see if I can get that for you.

40:54 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
  Okay, cool.

41:01 - Joshua McCrystal
  Yeah, I guess we... We kind of need to know how this business operates so that the AI can essentially imitate that.

41:11 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
  Yeah, right.

41:13 - Joshua McCrystal
  Especially certain things like what sort of things do they focus on when they're trying to build a budget? Do they go, all right, safety is number one or, you know, we need X, Y, Z better? Wow.

41:27 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
  Yeah. Like the more we can have access to about the company, the more like documents that we can have access to and like especially relevant ones about these procedures. Like, for example, like, do they have their procedures mapped out? Do they have?

41:44 - Christian Marangone
  So with that, I've actually brought in a secret weapon that we've got. I've actually got the daughter of the finance owner, if you will, right here with us. So the question that you had just before, could you run that one over again? was the paper trail. Yeah. So I'm wondering.

42:03 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
  Do we can we have access to basically the paper, the reports that like would run between departments. So like, once the once the client has a conversation initially with accounts, and, you know, I want to know, like, what's the procedure right now? And what is their objective? And then what is the report that goes from the accounts team? to the next stage?

42:34 - Christian Marangone
  So essentially what we're going to be doing right with the AI system that we want to develop, we want it to understand the entire process they do, what the conversations are, what the emails look like, and what information is being sent from who to where, right? So that way we can funnel it into the system to automate that entire process. And then get the data and then it can give them the relevant data they need for it as well. Is it that that's about on the money? Yep. Yep. Yeah. Is that possible to get? Because if we can get two or three examples of that, we can really refine this down to exactly where we need it to be. It could be a bit tricky. I don't have access to their emails right now. That's okay. Because they changed the outlook, but I... I don't know. Music. Cool. She's just going to have a look. So we'll give her five minutes to do that. That sounds good.

43:29 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
  And then, yeah, like the... I also, I think it's important to understand if the procedures are mapped out already and the process is mapped out already. And like if there's maybe internal documentation or guidance around the steps, because I've heard that it's very hard to automate if there's not systems already in place. So, yeah, of course.

44:00 - Christian Marangone
  The thing is, is that they're... They're restructuring. They currently removed three departments at least. Implementation is one of them. Yeah, three departments at least. So they are very much restructuring. They're very open to setting up a whole system wherein there is paper trail. I just don't have access to their system right now. Even the old emails because they transitioned from Google to Outlook. That's fun. Yeah. But they used Blue Project Management app to keep track of projects. So that's what they're currently using. That was their CRM. Yeah. To help them like guide where things are. Okay. That could be one of them. But in terms of procedure, pretty sure they would have a handbook regarding that. They would have that already. Okay. That's good. That makes it a little bit easier then. Yeah.

45:07 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
  Show him the examples of.

45:10 - Christian Marangone
  Yeah, we've gone over the spreadsheet, but the spreadsheet can only, like the spreadsheet can give some information and some basic examples, but that's for more like, like that's one part of it. We're trying to, the idea now is to develop the information for each department. Gotcha. So we've got one for accounts, one for implementation, one for procurement. What we can do, maybe we can list down the things that you guys would need. I fly out tomorrow, I arrive there tomorrow and I go to office on Monday. So she'll be in there with the entire business on Monday. On Monday. Cool.

45:44 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
  Okay. Yeah, that, that's good. I think now that I have, I want to review the, the notes from this call and, but I think you said that they'll have a handbook. I would be be interested to see what. I know they're restructuring and stuff, but I'd be interested to see what it looked like before, and also, I guess, if there's any information around where have things gone wrong in the past, that would be useful.

46:21 - Christian Marangone
  And the more information, the better.

46:24 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
  Don't worry about us needing to process too much information, because I think we can use AI to, like, literally help us process the documents. So the more documents, the better. Perfect. Yeah.

46:36 - Christian Marangone
  Amazing. The other thing that I wanted to run over with you today, Matthew, as well, especially, is this little section up here, which, again, I worked with Richard around this. So this is the hosting side of things, right? This is your bread and butter, Amazon. So now, chatting with Richard, he had no idea. said, Look, know, Matthew worked at Amazon for a he's like, right, cool, so you guys can just host it on AWS, right? Yeah, so. Yeah, for the knowledge base, we'll be using Bedrock for it and have Aurora as the backup extension. Does that all sound, like, aligned or...?

47:21 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
  Um, I want to know if you're planning to use OpenAI, or why would we use Bedrock, like, is it, are we using both somehow, or is it, like, can we use OpenAI's APIs? Because, because I know, because I know that, uh, with OpenAI, there's a, there's a thing called Responses API, and it, I used it recently to help set up, like, the knowledge base, and it, like, makes the development, um, a lot faster. Perfect.

48:02 - Christian Marangone
  So what we'll do, we'll just send that to OpenAI. Again, these, a lot of this stuff, I don't really follow on it, right? I've got a very, very general overview on like what it looks like, okay? This is just conversations that I have with him to really refine it and then to touch base with you on it and see sort of like where we go, right? So, you know, this, this is your stuff. This is your bread and butter. This is your baby. So we'll stick with OpenAI. Yeah, yeah, all good. So we'll stick with OpenAI for your stuff then, right? For the development side of it, right?

48:38 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
  Cause it's not like a super, we don't need super level of security. It's not like a crazy use case where it's like super protected data. So I think like we don't necessarily need to, obviously we need it to be secure, but there's levels of security. So, yeah.

49:03 - Joshua McCrystal
  Sorry, what was that? It's not like it's government documentation or something like that. It needs to be, you know, that's PII or some .  Yeah, exactly.

49:12 - Christian Marangone
  Yeah, I mean, of course, like, we do want to try and keep the information as, like, you know, close in as we can, obviously, respecting the business, but it doesn't need to be, like, you know, under lock and key in a safe with , you know, six foot, like, six foot concrete that's buried underground three kilometres or whatever. Like, it doesn't need to be crazy like that, you know? Yeah, for sure. Sorry, just give one second. Cool. Now, following on with that, Richard was talking about a couple other things. With the indexing and the chunking down, I feel like that's built into the AWS ecosystem or database. The chunking of, like, knowledge stored in the chatbot?

49:57 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
  Yeah.

49:58 - Christian Marangone
  Sorry. There's a few things that he mentioned to me, which I would... We're just going to come run over with you anyway, one was the indexing and the chunking down, second for that, right, with the chunking down to put it into ranking systems, he recommended Cohere API. Okay.

50:16 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
  Yeah. And that one actually, and I still need to look more into Aurora, by the way. Perfect. Awesome. What I'll do, I'll put it here.

50:25 - Christian Marangone
  So you just felt like this, just like that. Oh, that's a bit. Remove the second R after the H. So Cohere. Okay. Like, like this one.

50:38 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
  Yeah, exactly. Right.

50:39 - Christian Marangone
  So that's, that's an API ranking. The AWS Lambda. L-A-M. Yeah. You might know what that is. Yeah. Serverless. Yeah. And then something about step functions. Okay.

50:58 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
  I haven't used step functions before. Um. Okay. Okay. Yeah. Um, but I have heard of them and I think I've considered them before, so I can look more into those. I definitely, I've seen a lot of like what Richard posts in the network and I definitely respect his opinion. So I want to make sure I look into everything that he suggested. Perfect.

51:17 - Christian Marangone
  Yeah. So this is the sort of like, these, these, ideas that he came with trying to stick with the, with the Amazon ecosystem. Right. Um, if, if, if there's some changes that you want to make that you think will be better, please go right ahead. Um, just like, obviously keep me in the loop and we can, we can organize calls and stuff like that and see sort of like how that looks. Um, but yeah, that's sort of the general sort of idea, um, that I ran over with him as well as designing some of sort of like the idea of that backend. So with all that, what are we thinking? How are we feeling? Like is, is there a few extra things that like we need to touch on or look at or anything like that? So, so

52:02 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
  I was wondering if you found out from Richard or if you have preference on like using any of the no-code or low-code tools at all. Just curiosity, like did you want to use NADEN or is it all going to be fully custom-built? And what are your opinions on that?

52:21 - Christian Marangone
  To be honest, like, look, we can do custom-built, but look, here's the other thing, right? And this is the other thing that I do want to be very transparent about is the business is sinking right now. Not only is their reputation sinking, but their funds are sinking. They're in a tough position. So we do have to take that into consideration with not only the cost of what this is going to look like, but as well as that, like the cost that we are going to like charge them as well. This, this, this this project right now is to get in early with them to set a foundation with them and then down the track. Once we've got the trust and they've realized the value that's built there, that's when we can start looking at developing something absolutely insane that is like a statement piece for who they are, right? But right now, it's about getting in, getting the quick wins, getting the value there with the cheapest possible overhead that we can have. Yeah, got it. So I think maybe utilizing something like NAN, and then, you know, with like, again, you would know more about it. I've got a very, very basic overview of it, but I think NAN would be a valuable resource, one for time, two for cost.

53:42 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
  Yeah. What's your thoughts? So, yeah. I can be a bit torn between like NAN and just using cloud code and creating stuff in code because... So, especially now that I've worked on several projects, I have several components that are custom code components that are just, like, ready to use, pretty much. Like, I have integrations with Lambda set up, I have Terraform files that can, that have, like, integrations with AWS that just, like, set up pieces of it. But that means that I won't have everything, and there will be some that we would need to build, whereas, like, N8N will just have, most likely, it will have most of the things as already built, ready to use components, and we just feed the inputs, and we test and verify the outputs. I think... . . . So one concern I've had with N8N is the testing of the outputs, but I know that they do have an evals platform, and I know that, like, so many people have been delivering solutions that way, and I think I would agree that probably N8N, for the quick wins, might be a good path. But I definitely want to, like, before I sort of prescribe the solution and the architecture, I just want to make sure I have a good understanding of the problems and, you know, like, a bit more data, like, we can map out, like, the high level, what we want to do right now, even just with the notes from this call. At a high level, but then we really want to focus on Getting a quick win. Why is the company sinking? What is the biggest lever that we can attack with software? We don't want to just build. We don't want to spend time and resources building something that is not really going to help them that much just because we're engineers and we want to build stuff and we'll build whatever. We need to focus on what the business needs right now. We can come up with a prioritized list of like, okay, where are they losing money the most? Where are they losing money the quickest? Where is the communication gaps the most? Like, what is the biggest problem? What are the biggest problems? And rank them and just be like, okay, let's attack the, you know, where can we get actually get the biggest win?

56:57 - Christian Marangone
  So in my mind, from the conversations that we've we've had, right? So, my mind, some of the biggest problems that we're facing right now, we'll just put it as overseeing, right, or like overseeing like those costs or, you the slashes of the 5k's here, there, the in-between, right, so overseeing for that.

57:26 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
  Yeah. It'd be good to get numbers on like, you know, how often did this happen last month or like, like, you know, how often did this happen every month and every quarter? Yeah, it definitely happens per project.

57:43 - Christian Marangone
  The only issue in terms of like finding exact numbers is they've got such a large scope of projects that have different costs. So for what it won't affect on one, it will affect massively on another. I actually found, you know, I'm good with being able to pull information out of people and getting numbers, but... out. Yeah. I Man, to get numbers out of them was, it was tricky, to put it lightly. When Jane had her first discovery call with them, I wasn't there, I was at work. When she had her first discovery call, she struggled to get information out of them as well regarding numbers because the age is, yeah. So overseeing, we'll just put a dollar sign next to it, right? So second one would be communication for sure. So communication between departments, right? Okay. Right. So communication departments. And then I think we should also put maybe note taking or communication between client and business. Because again, that ties into the overseeing of it's like, oh, I forgot to mention that they wanted a food truck. You know what I mean? It's like, well,  it. So what I'll do there is I'll just put maybe the forgotten cost.

59:07 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
  Like, details from the client request, though. Like, the client requested details, they just forgot because, you know, we're not perfect. Yeah, 100%.

59:21 - Christian Marangone
  You know, like, everyone makes  ups. that's the other thing, right? I actually, I was on a call the other night with her uncle, who is the president, and the founder of the entire business. They have  ups all the time, right? It's the nature of their business, right? There's always going be  ups, there's always going to be costs associated, but the ones that they've taken recently have been so big and just shouldn't have been there that it's put them in a very jeopardized position, right? That's the other one. The next one is, I'd say we can put lack of structure, right? So we'll structure down here, because I think that's... It's a little bit, like, structure is definitely a big thing, but we can solve that very quickly with any system that we build.

1:00:12 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
  Yeah, it might actually be a longer term thing to fully solve the structure problem. But yeah, definitely cause issues, though.

1:00:25 - Christian Marangone
  Yeah. And then more of, this is what they want, right? What they realistically want is centralization. That's like their big thing. That's the biggest thing they're chasing right now is centralization. Okay. Yeah.

1:00:46 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
  Is it because they keep being like, you know, like, who do I ask about this? Like, who knows about this? And then they have to go find it or they like communicate between departments. When they could just be referencing a centralized database or something.

1:00:59 - Christian Marangone
  There's that aspect of it. But regarding back to the paper trail, to put it in the easiest way, without going into too much detail, there was a person who had a department, that department is no longer there, who was put in an extremely trustworthy position, and she allowed company resources and her team to go work for a direct competitor and essentially stabbed not only the entire family, but the entire business in the back. So the centralization is also knowing who goes where, what happened, like, in the nicest way possible, a government ID type situation, to where it's like, we know what resources are doing what and like, where is going where, without being like, so overbearing and dictating, but ensuring that the resources isn't being used on other .  Okay.

1:01:57 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
  Yeah. that make sense? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Kind of like, Well, I think it seems overall like there's just a lack of tracking things. Yeah, for sure.

1:02:10 - Christian Marangone
  So that might be the biggest win of itself.

1:02:13 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
  Just, I don't know, like, and, and just, so how do they do, one question is like, how do they do these client meetings? Because if they're doing conversations over the phone, and we can't track it with an AI note taker, if we don't know if there's a, I don't know if there's a solution for that. Like, personally, I've just been using Fathom on Google Meet. And if we can get them to just use Google Meets, or just use video for meeting that has the AI note taker, like that will, one, help keep track of all the little details, unless, of course, the AI misses the details, which it might, that's also a common problem with AI. But I think it will reduce the chances that that happens. Yeah. And it will also give us the data we need to get more visibility into what's going on in the company. Yeah, for sure.

1:03:21 - Christian Marangone
  So Zoom and Google Meet with notetakers, that's obviously a big thing. Yeah. if you agree with that, I'm pretty sure off-memory they use Zoom, off-memory they use Zoom. Okay. You know, if we put them over to Google Meet, that's fine as well. We'll figure something out there, that's fine. Yeah, I think either way is fine.

1:03:44 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
  The thing we need is the AI notetaker output, and would they be willing to adopt that? Yeah.

1:03:53 - Christian Marangone
  I don't see why they wouldn't. I'm pretty sure my mum used one for a meeting anyway. I'm just going to be  to go sit through the whole hour and a half conversation because I was in the middle. So, um, but yeah, I compartmentalized everything. I got all the information out of it anyway.

1:04:10 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
  Um, the second thing.

1:04:13 - Christian Marangone
  So yeah, obviously collecting the information is probably the biggest thing, right? All the information gets where it needs to get to. And even if let's say, let's say that on average, again, this is so widespread of a number, right? Let's say that there's 10 things that missed that total cost of 50k. If we can reduce that down to one or two things, and that cost goes from 50k down to five or 10k, that's already massive in their eyes anyway. I think the second thing that definitely needs to be the biggest selling point here as well is the time reduction, right? 82 weeks, 80 hours, one client, it doesn't matter how big the project is, right? Like, and if it's a bigger project, that's a longer timeline for it anyway, right? That's, that's too long. You know what I mean? Like two weeks to sign a client is ridiculous. are-抓, this It The Thank  Yeah.

1:05:03 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
  So like, what are their, I guess, do they have checklists that they work towards for that two week period? Remember that sheet that I pulled up before?

1:05:14 - Christian Marangone
  Yeah.

1:05:15 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
  That's it. Okay, cool. So that will help us get started. Yeah, for sure.

1:05:27 - Christian Marangone
  So the two biggest things to focus on right now is the Zoom Google meet with the note takers and ensuring that information gets to where it needs to get to. And the ability to save the time by shortening down the checklist and giving like, a custom rag system that can provide enough like information to where they only have to do a quick oversee on it. Is that sort of the idea that we're having here? Or how are you seeing it?

1:05:56 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
  Um, so the . The idea with the RAG system is essentially to communicate between departments, or is it something that's like a centralized resource that anyone in the company could use?

1:06:20 - Christian Marangone
  The idea that I'm having for it is that we can use it to provide recommended and most ideal data for them to short track the checklist tool, so that way they're not spending 40 hours to do it, they're spending four hours to do it, with like cross-referencing and everything. Okay. That I'm envisioning it, but if you've got a better way, one that you think would be more effective, I'd be happy to hear it as well.

1:06:49 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
  Yeah. I really want to go back to the handbook thing and just see what is their current process, because there might just be some... I think just understanding what they're currently doing can really give visibility into the best solution at the end of the day, whether that's a chatbot and we put it in a certain place in the flow or whether that's a process refinement before the chatbot stage, I don't know yet. And then there's like, like, I would want to look at the first part really in detail, like that conversation with the client, because if we can just make sure we capture everything the client wants and feed that through the system, that will eliminate the  ups, which seems to be the thing that's bringing them under right now. So, like, if we Can take a good hard look at that section, I think. And if we can make improve that first section, that might automatically improve the downstream time that takes. And then, so I think that's the one that we target first is the intake. And like, how does that whole intake process happen?

1:08:28 - Christian Marangone
  Are you asking me now? Or is that just like the question to put out there?

1:08:32 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
  That's, no, yeah, that's the question that we need to understand the answer to. And we can, you know, as soon as, like, if there's more, if there's documentation, if there's like, if you know already, then, like, wherever we can get more details about that client intake process, that will help inform everything, I think. Like, because then we can Understand like, okay, how do we get, maybe there's a quick win right there at the beginning. Like, it wouldn't make sense to look at the finance section first. Like, I think we look at that section first, Yeah, of course.

1:09:15 - Christian Marangone
  So, this might be a question for you. These are sort of the ideas that we're looking at, right? So, we've established which we knew that the biggest -ups right now that are costing the business of people missing information and not conveying the information correctly across to the rest of the departments, right? She just rolled her eyes, so you know that that's obviously a big issue. Second thing is saving time between the departments, which we established two weeks to sign one client as a  joke. So, the big thing here is going be the handbook. And then from there, we can go over whether we want to do a chatbot, whether we want to do a process refinement prior to the chatbot. We need to have a look at step one here. Which is? Which is the. The process of it is actually through Zoom or face-to-face because our clients are not, they're not the usual digital marketing, it's events. So they usually do face-to-face meetings. So that's where it's a bit tricky on like gathering the whole data. Okay. Yeah. We're supposed to work around that though. There's a way to work around it, like the note-taking apps that we have, right? Exactly. We can use that. So that's one, that's the number one way client and team speaks first. And then once they have, once they meet face-to-face, that's when the email thread starts. The email paper trial, yeah. Yes, that's when it starts. And then the accounts team then talks through, talks by email to the other department. Sorry. Does that make sense? Yeah.

1:12:00 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
  I'm just, I'm still thinking about the. When there's a face-to-face interaction, I wonder if we can, like, if they, if your company can kind of pull up the phone and, like, a Google Meet on the phone, and I don't know if Fathom works, if, like, the AI Notetaker works just on the phone, or maybe there's a way you can set it up beforehand where it basically can also record those face-to-face meetings because that might help. Oh, okay.

1:12:33 - Christian Marangone
  I think there is a way, because I remember when, when I was on my sales call with Joel, right, before jumping into the community, he was, he was suggesting ideas for me because I'm thinking as well as that for my job that I go to at Oxygen, which kicks off next year, I'm thinking of implementing a system essentially like Fireflies, where I'll have a microphone clipped to my shirt that costs 80 bucks and it records it and then feeds it into something like Fireflies. Fireflies and then condenses that. Maybe that could be an idea as well, but that would also, again, that's like an after conversation, right? But maybe we can have a look into that and see if that's like a possibility or, you know, if we can figure out a way that Fireflies or Fathom can run through it anyway.

1:13:18 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
  Yeah, because once we have that data captured, like the transcript captured, then we can do a lot of things with it. Yeah, absolutely.

1:13:27 - Christian Marangone
  It'll be not a day difference like that. Yeah, right.

1:13:32 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
  Cool.

1:13:33 - Christian Marangone
  Okay. So right now, it's going to come down to your shoulders then, I think. We, when you're over in the office, I need you to, well, we need you to get a lot of this information here. So just to summarize on the exact information that we need, right, to ensure that we've got a bang, hit list type of situation ready to go, right? Handbook is the biggest thing. That's a non-negotiable is the handbook. Even the old one. Yeah. Yeah, perfect. Cool. Handbook, check. The client, can you pass me a couple of those? The client's onboarding process would be the second one, or client intake, however you want to word it. My chest hurts so much. Client onboarding? Yeah. And the client needs analysis, right? You know what I'm talking about when I say needs analysis, yeah? Cool. Analysis. Perfect. Matthew, is there anything else that comes to mind for you?

1:14:51 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
  Yeah. mean, while we're collecting all this data, we might as well collect data about, like, the other pieces of it, because... There is a chance that the client discussion stuff is all actually pretty good. So we want to make sure we understand the procurement and implementation process as well. And essentially the handoff processes between the teams is the most important to understand. And also if there's any that don't have a process or a checklist, then that's going to be something that we would want to look into. And just understand where that gap in process is. And then one more thing is just to understand kind of like within those processes, just like what data is being tracked and if there's any data not. I know it's kind of like a huge ask, but that's, I guess, the goal. And we can fill in pieces over the lifetime of the project. Yeah, for sure.

1:16:20 - Christian Marangone
  It's obviously going to be a big chunk, but I think just the reality of where they're sitting, it just needs to kind of be like that, right? Yeah. Yeah. So that way we can really find the biggest pain point and solve it the fastest way possible, the most efficiently. And then from there, once we've got that, we can sit down, we can run over everything. If you can compartmentalize documents into an email and stuff like that, we can sit down here on a call. talk to Tristan? Yeah? I think we have dinner. You've got dinner with her? Yeah. Okay, cool. All right. Easy. Yeah, if we can get... Yeah, I think if we can even... So 80% or 60% of this information, I think it'll still put us in a really, really good spot. think probably the biggest pain, like the biggest key points here, handbook, that's a bit non-negotiable. The needs analysis and the client onboarding. And then from there would be like data tracking and checklist slash processes. Yep. In that order.

1:17:27 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
  Actually, I think checklists and processes would be before data. Maybe. yeah, absolutely.

1:17:35 - Christian Marangone
  So what we can do is these top three here, then it'll be these two, then it'll be this one. So do one, two, three.

1:17:45 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
  Because that order helps us understand if there's like a gap in process somewhere. Like if there's just a gap in process somewhere and someone just needs to think through it, that could solve it even without us needing to implement any AI. That could help.

1:18:00 - Christian Marangone
  Yeah, for sure. So, all right, cool. Once we've got that, we can come back, we can sit down, we can have a look at like, perfect, what's going to be the next steps from here? What's that going to look like? What's the timeframe? What's the cost? Things like that. And then from there, that's where you can really refine like what we're going to offer and how that's going to go about it. How's that sound? Yeah, I think that sounds like a good plan.

1:18:25 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
  Sounds great. Awesome.

1:18:27 - Christian Marangone
  And then on that call, that's when we'll talk more about, yeah, sort of what we'll line up for. Realistically, right? Let's say that we get everything in section one, right? What do we sort of like, what would you be leaning a little bit more toward? Or does that also depend on like what data comes out of it?

1:18:50 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
  So, section one, handbook, the client onboarding and their needs analysis.

1:18:54 - Christian Marangone
  So the conversation is like this. Yeah.

1:18:57 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
  So like, if we have, say we have like a transcript, we have some trans... So transcripts of what actually happens, and then we have the handbook of what's kind of like supposed to happen, then we can just literally look at that and assess it for gaps. And then, I mean, we would, we would be funneling the, the, the transcript, what I think would happen is we'd be funneling the transcript through, like, well, we need to, we need to do that analysis first, and we need to understand, like, what's, what's happening, and where the, where the gaps, and, like, I guess, like, the main point is just, like, where are things being forgotten? And, like, if they're just recorded, uh, maybe, that, uh, is, like, The biggest initial win, and then like from there, is that your question? Like from there, what's the next thing?

1:20:11 - Christian Marangone
  Yeah, I think if we can get it recorded, and then once that's recorded, we can refine down into like what's missed, what needs to be looked at, so on and so forth, and they sort of know what the scope is from there to ensure they're at least trying to stick with inside their budget. Because if we can get them to stick with inside their budget, that's the biggest thing, right? Yeah.

1:20:33 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
  I also kind of think the budget might expand if, you know, we would deliver a good quick win. Yeah.

1:20:44 - Christian Marangone
  Sorry, I was talking about budget of the clients. Yeah. Clients, yeah, yeah. So because right now, a lot of their things, they're not sticking inside their budgets. So if we can get them to stick inside their budgets, that'll provide that value, which then they'll be like, .  I'd it We can get more out of this, which then we can get a bigger intake and a bigger budget to be able to expand this as well. Yeah.

1:21:08 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
  Okay. So it's, it's, it's the operation of the company is trying to, you know, stay within the budget of what the client is asking. Um, okay. I guess we would need to identify like, where does it go out of budget, uh, today? Like, what are some examples of like, where it's gone out of budget and why, and what's the reasoning behind that?

1:21:36 - Christian Marangone
  It's mainly having to do with the employees basically forgetting. Yeah. It's, it's, it's, it's mainly there. It's, it's those 5k overseas per, per project, 10 times, which totals out to 50k. Right. You remember that like concept is that. There's no like proper documentation. So client would say, Oh, we said this to you. In the meeting, or via email, and then it's overlooked, because there's no organization, there's no follow-ups, and so on and so forth, and then now they're just , because they already signed the contract, and they have to deliver at the end of And they're taking a loss because of that. Yeah. Okay. Yeah.

1:22:26 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
  So then, I guess what I would want to build at that point is just, like, proper tracking. So, pulling from the transcript and just being like, hey, like, remember this? Or, like, just like a checklist. Maybe it's emails that go to people at the right time. Yeah. That's what I thought of the email source.

1:22:46 - Christian Marangone
  Yeah. So that's one thing that I was doing that I was playing around. I just never got ran to completing it. I've just kind of, it's been sitting here, and I just haven't got around to it. But let me, where's my share screen? I was doing this on N8N, right? And again, very simple. Simple system, same as Nate Herbst's stuff. Cool. Yeah, yeah. You already understand what's going on here with this. Yeah. Yeah, perfect. Gmail trigger, text classifier, compartmentalizes into one section, then would reread the email, break it down into what it is, put out a draft email saying, hey, XYZ, write, have a template, then you get a notification for what needs to be followed on for, so on and so forth type. Again, just very general idea of it. I've just never got around to finishing it, so I'm so focused on everything else. But yeah, something like that, which again, can be very easily built on NAN, can just save so much time and headache, right? Yeah.

1:23:53 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
  And like if the source is, like we can have the source be the Fathom API? Yeah. So one, quite one thing. The that can add complexity is, I don't know how to work with like, because each employee will have their own Fathom, I'm guessing, or how would that work? Because we don't, would there be one company account Fathom? It seems like a giant company, so I don't think that's feasible, really. They've got, what is it, 60 employees at the moment?

1:24:27 - Christian Marangone
  Yeah, 60 employees at the moment. How much is Fathom? How much does Fathom cost usually, or do they, or are they like different, are you looking at it? It costs 15 dollars a month. I would say the accounts people would have it. Yeah, just the accounts team, which is how many people, what, like five? Yeah. So 5, 15, what's that, 60, okay, plus additional, Yeah, it's like 100 bucks a month. That's nothing, and it's tax deductible anyway. Yeah, we're different tax system. we're lucky. We paid taxes quite early. Huh? Full tax price. Yeah, so what we could just do with that is we could just have it for strictly the accounts team, because obviously that's the most important standpoint right now, is get the information from the client, ensure it's the correct information, and then the rest of it gets looked at. Yeah, cool. That's the only team that would do face-to-face meeting with clients. They'll be the ones who need it now. Well, in the nicest way possible, they're the ones that are  up. Oh, yeah. Yeah, so the more that we can reduce the -ups from accounts, and get the correct information from the clients to follow through through the rest of the departments, and be checked out, that's the biggest win right there. Yeah. Less -ups, the better. That's been established. Yeah. So, accounts same problem. Cool. Yeah. Awesome.

1:25:59 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
  Thank you. Awesome. So you said there might be like five people in the accounts team? Yeah.

1:26:06 - Christian Marangone
  Five, six, six as the director. Six as the director? Cool. Hundred bucks a month. I don't think they would be close to that.

1:26:18 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
  Um, wait, sorry, what was that? You don't think they would be close? No, no, no, they wouldn't be opposed to the idea.

1:26:24 - Christian Marangone
  Wouldn't be opposed. Oh, okay. Cool.

1:26:27 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
  Sounds good. Um, so then, yeah, there would just be like five different API keys that need to be wired up.

1:26:35 - Christian Marangone
  Sometimes I, I do believe they mainly use Zoom for the calls for online meetings. Good. They might use Otter AI because that's what I see them when we had a meeting with them. That's what, yeah, but that was just your mom. So that if my mom's using it, most likely everyone in the company. What is it called? Otter. O-T-T-E-R. That AI. Yeah. Do you know of that one? Yeah, I've seen that one. I've that

1:27:02 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
  News before. then Zoom itself also now has its own AI. Yeah.

1:27:10 - Christian Marangone
  It records and transcripts all the calls. Yeah.

1:27:13 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
  So, like, are they paying for Zoom already? Like the pro version that includes?

1:27:19 - Christian Marangone
  All right. Yeah. Cool.

1:27:22 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
  So if they're paying for that already, let's check if if it's the AI transcription is already included. And if they can just flip a switch or something. They did.

1:27:34 - Christian Marangone
  Remember, they sent in the transcript to us after the meeting? Yeah, you sent it to me. I never watched it. I just compartmentalized the transcripts into the key points. They do have the transcript. Yeah. Well, that's that's a good start. I'll confirm it again for the accounts team. I mean, the reality is, right, let's say they do it. They've only just started using it, but they're still blocking it. Oh, yeah. So it doesn't matter. We just said perfect. Perfect. We'll reduce your -up stamp to 1%.

1:28:08 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
  Any transcripts that are already created, I think that we should get those sent over as soon as possible. Yeah, because we can use that as well. Yeah.

1:28:20 - Christian Marangone
  Okay. There's a lot of information that's been running through. Let's chunk it down into the key things that we need. Right? We've got the three main sets of data. Right, here, which we do want to look at in terms of hierarchy of most important to, not least important, but where okay to sort of skip over, give or take. Right? Second thing, second is, well, it ties into this, is the processes. So it'll primarily be around the accounts team. Right? With their calls, with the meetings, and so on and so forth. um, and then. From there, once we've got that information, we can then have a look at how we're going to develop the system with centralization and reducing the amount of, like, forgotten and overseeing costs and communication losses between departments or people or clients and so on and so forth. Okay.

1:29:23 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
  Is that sort of what we're thinking right now?

1:29:28 - Christian Marangone
  Yeah, I think that sounds good.

1:29:32 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
  That'll definitely give us a better scope. then especially if we have some transcripts to work with, then we can start, I can start working with those. Yeah.

1:29:45 - Christian Marangone
  Amazing. A little box there. Cool. Is there anything else that comes to mind for you, Matthew, that would be of, like, big priority right now? Um, I guess I'm wondering, like, why or not why. Um...

1:30:02 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
  Are they, if they have transcripts that are being used or that are being captured right now, are those being used in any way already? Because if they're already recording transcripts, and if they're already using them for something, I think it would be good if we know that, because that might also just be like the most important thing that they identified to use it for, but I don't know if they're using that yet. Yeah.

1:30:35 - Christian Marangone
  Cool. Amazing. Alrighty. And then after this, what we'll do is we'll, when, when we've got the information, we'll come back, we'll catch up again, we'll run over everything, and then we'll design a bit of a game plan. Um, instead of developing a demo for them, I've run over with Otto a replacement idea that we can do, which is great. Instead instead of developing out a whole system. and selling it to them, right, because I still need to get them over the line, right, but right now it's just mapping it out and getting information that we need from you to ensure that we can figure out like what your costs are going to be as well, right, is I'm going to develop a Figma flow, right, so once we've got the idea down in place, we can map out on how it's going to look into a Figma flow, right, develop that, and then that's where I can do the pitch. Sounds good.

1:31:29 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
  Awesome. And then the pitch, is that going to be, I'm guessing we're going to do like a phased approach?

1:31:37 - Christian Marangone
  Right now, it'll just be like, again, yeah, like for us, the way that we're looking at it is going to be very different to the way that they're looking at it. So for us, we're looking in the four quadrants or, you know, long-term scope, right, for them, right, right now, we're just trying to get them over the line. And I'm like, look, we can do this for you, right, and if it goes well, we'll have a look at some other conversations down the track, and that's just how I'm going to say. So Okay. Sounds good.

1:32:05 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
  Yeah.

1:32:06 - Christian Marangone
  then once they realize the value and once they realize that, holy , that's when we can be like, perfect. How about a custom and savvy only solution? You guys the only one that got it and you guys will have niche XYZ associated with it. Yeah. Yeah.

1:32:22 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
  And that's when we can, um, you know, ask for more payment. Exactly. We can, we can have a bigger budget.

1:32:31 - Christian Marangone
  If you want to develop full custom code, you're more than welcome to do that as well. Right. And we'll figure out a way that we can, you know, get that up and running and get that sorted. And then everyone, everyone eats as I like to say. Yeah.

1:32:44 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
  Sounds good. So, um, after that, right.

1:32:48 - Christian Marangone
  Once, once we've got all this information, we'll develop the chunks, we'll develop what it looks like. Um, I'll get them over the line. I'll , I'll get them over the line. Right. Once we get them over the line, that's when we can decide either. Yeah. Okay. Thank Who's going to do what, or how we're going to go about this next process, who falls into what category, things like that, and we'll figure out all those bits and pieces as well.

1:33:12 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
  Okay, sounds good. All right. Easy as.

1:33:18 - Christian Marangone
  Turtle lad, you got anything?

1:33:21 - Joshua McCrystal
  No, I've just pretty much been sitting in the passenger seat here. It's pretty much all been covered, like any questions I had, Matthew was asking them. So, yeah, obviously, yeah, we just need the more information now. But with the info we've got, I think sort of the game plan, we can clearly see what their pain points is. From what I can gather, it's basically a game of Chinese whispers that's  them over, and we just need to stop with the, you know, the telephone calls between. It just needs to be pure information, sort of centralized. know. to like, a it's So, Right? Go Yeah, And put into the places that it needs to be, so that it's not being missed. Spot on.

1:34:09 - Christian Marangone
  Pretty much. Beautiful.

1:34:10 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
  I guess I was wondering about like, are we going to be charging them for the audit part? Or how does that work? Because I know we're trying to get our foot in the door.

1:34:22 - Christian Marangone
  I won't charge them for the audit. Because, again, it's just right now for them, it's just getting them over the line. Once we get them over the line, what we can do is we can have a look at, like, the idea of a retainer. And we can scope on how that's going to look. But even then, I've already sort of created a game plan for that. But the retainer is definitely going to be looking like the most viable option. So we'll have the post up front, then we'll have a retainer, right? Then with that retainer, right, at the moment, essentially for the retainer pitch side of it, I'm just going to be like, look, the end of the day, like, this can be a slightly complex system. What I'm going have to do is do. You guys is we'll just have a retainer, right? Usually I charge someone 500 USD a month, right? For this retainer. However, because I understand that you guys are struggling, I'm going to bring that down to 250 a month, right? And then from there, we can sit down as a group and have a conversation on how that's going to be divvied up, right? Who can cover what? Or if something needs to be fixed, who needs to, you know, who takes priority on that? And then we'll, you know, have that go equal based upon that. Okay, sounds good.

1:35:32 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
  One idea, another idea I just had is like, their emails, like, especially when you're showing this, like, can we can we hook into their emails? Like, can we get access to the emails? And hook in? That might be tricky.

1:35:49 - Christian Marangone
  For right now? Yeah, that might be tricky to get access to their emails. Why is that? Why is that? Well, well, the number one thing is the privacy, right? That's it. That's the number one thing they'd be concerned about. Yep. A lot of it's really private. Would you want, like, just sample emails? Would that be fine?

1:36:14 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
  Yeah. Yeah, we don't have to get every single one. Like, we could cherry pick. The thing that I would want to have the email for is just, like... The usual type of emails that they would get.

1:36:28 - Christian Marangone
  Is that...?

1:36:30 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
  Yeah, like, tracking or kind of, like, understanding where the key information is flowing. So maybe the handbook is the best place to start, even. And then we can, you know, we can set up email, like, auto-reply or processing or something later if we find that that might be a good idea, but...

1:36:53 - Christian Marangone
  That's what I was thinking as well. Already, like, kind of off the bat, but whether we can get access... I think, right now, develop the trust once... Once got the trust, right, and once we've got the quick win and the foot in the door, that's when we can start looking at some more sensitive data. Yeah, sounds good.

1:37:15 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
  Crazy.

1:37:16 - Christian Marangone
  Easy as, all right lads, I appreciate your time, it's been absolutely great. I'll keep you boys in the loop, sort of like what's going on. We can touch base and organize another one of these calls once we've got all this information ready to go. It'll, again, still be before Christmas, the goal is to have these guys on board before Christmas, so that's the scope, that's the way it's looking, please don't put it on the door, and yeah, we'll go from there, but I'll let you guys know sort of what the next steps are, and how it's looking, and where we're gonna head from here, right?

1:37:51 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
  Okay, awesome, and I'll send you, I'll try and like just break down this Fathom call and send you something. Thanks, Joshua, thanks very much.

1:38:02 - Christian Marangone
  Matthew. Oh, sorry. Thanks, Joshua and Matthew. I'll see you later. Thank you. So much for a 30-minute meeting.

1:38:10 - Joshua McCrystal
  Oh, my Lord.

1:38:12 - Christian Marangone
  Yeah, it's never going to be a 30-minute meeting, brother. Never going to be a 30-minute meeting. It's good to meet you as well, Matthew.

1:38:18 - Joshua McCrystal
  I'm looking forward to it.

1:38:20 - Christian Marangone
  Yeah, great to meet you too, Turtle.

1:38:22 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
  Yeah, my meetings, when I need to know information, I just keep asking questions.

1:38:27 - Joshua McCrystal
  No, it's good. It's good though. That's the way to do it, bro.

1:38:30 - Christian Marangone
  That's the way to do it. All right, awesome, lads. Appreciate your time. All right. Thank you, guys. You too.

1:38:36 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
