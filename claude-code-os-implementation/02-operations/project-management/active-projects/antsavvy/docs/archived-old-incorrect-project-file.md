## Proposed Solution

### Fathom OS Integration for Meeting Tracking

**Workflow:**
1. Every client meeting recorded via Fathom
2. Fathom webhook triggers on meeting end
3. Transcript automatically processed
4. Key data points extracted:
   - Client name and details
   - Problems discussed
   - Action items identified
   - Important data points
   - Follow-up requirements
5. Automatic file creation in organized structure
6. Meeting summary generated
7. Action items added to tracking system

**Technical Components:**
- Fathom API/webhook integration
- Transcript processing (AI-powered)
- Data extraction and classification
- Automatic file/folder structure creation
- Meeting summary generation
- Action item tracking
- Search and retrieval interface

## Questions to Answer

1. What specific data points do they need from each meeting?
2. How many client meetings per week/month?
3. What's their current process (and why is it failing)?
4. What's the cost of NOT having this system? (Company failure?)
5. Who uses the system? (Just Christian/Turtle or whole team?)
6. What's their budget/urgency level?
7. Do they need real-time alerts or just storage?
