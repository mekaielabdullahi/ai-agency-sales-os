# Plotter Mechanix Phase 3 - Vision & Roadmap

**Created:** January 24, 2026
**Status:** Future Planning (Post Phase 2 Completion)
**Depends On:** Phase 2 success validation + Kelsey/Nikki business goals

---

## Executive Summary

Phase 3 is about **scaling revenue and freeing Kelsey** once Phase 2 infrastructure is in place.

**Phase 2 Built:**
- Training system (Kelsey can hire without being bottleneck)
- Equipment CRM (know customer history, predict needs)
- Ply + integrations (efficiency, inventory visibility)

**Phase 3 Leverages:**
- The infrastructure to drive revenue growth
- The data to automate business development
- The team capacity to serve more customers

**Core Outcome:** Kelsey's business grows 30-50% while his hours DECREASE.

---

## What Phase 3 Might Include

### Stream 1: Revenue Growth Automation

#### 1.1 Proactive Maintenance Outreach Engine
**Problem:** Reactive service only = lumpy revenue, customer churn

**Solution:** Automated outreach based on equipment CRM data

**How It Works:**
- Equipment CRM tracks last service date, meter readings, equipment age
- System identifies customers due for maintenance
- Auto-generates personalized outreach (email/SMS)
- Alyssa gets daily "outreach list" with talking points
- Tracks conversion rate (outreach → booked service)

**ROI Potential:**
- Convert 30% of eligible customers to proactive maintenance
- 50 customers × 30% × $500 avg service = **$7,500/month** = **$90,000/year**

**Investment:** $8,000-12,000

---

#### 1.2 Service Contract Sales Automation
**Problem:** Eligible customers not being pitched contracts

**Solution:** Contract eligibility scoring + automated sales process

**How It Works:**
- Equipment CRM scores customers (frequency, equipment value, history)
- Top 20% get "contract eligible" flag
- System generates contract proposal with customer-specific data
- Alyssa/Andrew gets script + proposal ready to send
- Track contract close rate

**ROI Potential:**
- Close 10 new contracts at $99/mo = **$990/mo** = **$11,880/year**
- Year 2: 20 contracts = **$23,760/year**

**Investment:** $6,000-8,000

---

#### 1.3 Used Parts Marketplace
**Problem:** $50k inventory sitting unused, no system to sell it

**Solution:** Simple e-commerce storefront for used/refurbished parts

**How It Works:**
- Ply used parts inventory syncs to storefront
- Customers can browse/buy online
- Automated pricing (cost + margin calculation)
- Integration with Jobber for invoicing
- Track used parts revenue recovery

**ROI Potential:**
- Sell 20% of $50k inventory = **$10,000/year revenue**
- Ongoing: $2,000-5,000/year as new parts come in

**Investment:** $10,000-15,000

---

### Stream 2: Operational Excellence

#### 2.1 Andrew's Supplies Sales CRM
**Problem:** Andrew needs tools to track leads, quotes, follow-ups

**Solution:** Simple sales pipeline for supplies side of business

**How It Works:**
- Lead capture (web form, phone, referral)
- Quote builder with inventory check
- Follow-up reminders for Andrew
- Win/loss tracking
- Integration with Jobber for fulfillment

**ROI Potential:**
- Increase Andrew's close rate 10-15% = **$20,000-30,000/year**
- Better lead tracking = less missed opportunities

**Investment:** $5,000-8,000

---

#### 2.2 Customer Satisfaction & Review System
**Problem:** No systematic feedback, missing online reviews

**Solution:** Post-service feedback loop + review generation

**How It Works:**
- Auto-send feedback survey after every job
- Flag issues for Kelsey to address
- Request reviews from happy customers (Google, Yelp)
- Track NPS score over time
- Monthly satisfaction report

**ROI Potential:**
- 5-10 new 5-star reviews = better inbound lead flow
- Catch issues before they become churn = **$15,000-30,000/year retention value**

**Investment:** $4,000-6,000

---

#### 2.3 Financial Dashboard & Reporting
**Problem:** No real-time visibility into business performance

**Solution:** Live dashboard with key business metrics

**Metrics:**
- Revenue (service vs. supplies vs. contracts)
- Profitability by customer/job type
- Technician utilization (Kelsey, Joe, Steve)
- Inventory turns
- Customer acquisition cost
- Lifetime value by customer segment

**ROI Potential:**
- Better decision-making = **10-15% margin improvement** = **$60,000-90,000/year**

**Investment:** $8,000-12,000

---

### Stream 3: Team Scaling

#### 3.1 Steve Onboarding & Management System
**Problem:** Phase 2 enables hiring Steve, but need to manage him

**Solution:** Tech performance tracking + job assignment optimization

**How It Works:**
- Track jobs completed, time per job, customer ratings
- Identify Steve's strengths vs. training gaps
- Optimize job assignment (Joe gets X, Steve gets Y, Kelsey gets premium)
- Performance leaderboard (gamification)
- Training progress tracking

**ROI Potential:**
- Optimize tech utilization = **$40,000-60,000/year** in additional capacity
- Faster Steve ramp-up = **2-3 weeks saved** = **$12,000-18,000**

**Investment:** $6,000-10,000

---

#### 3.2 Technician Recruiting Pipeline
**Problem:** Will need to hire more techs as business grows

**Solution:** Automated recruiting funnel

**How It Works:**
- Job posting automation (Indeed, ZipRecruiter)
- Applicant tracking system
- Pre-screening questionnaire
- Video interview library (candidates watch, record responses)
- Scorecard for Kelsey to review only qualified candidates

**ROI Potential:**
- Reduce hiring time by 50% = **Kelsey saves 20 hours per hire** = **$6,000/hire**
- Better candidate quality = less turnover

**Investment:** $5,000-8,000

---

### Stream 4: Customer Experience

#### 4.1 Customer Portal (Self-Service)
**Problem:** Simple questions = Alyssa's time wasted

**Solution:** Customer login to view history, request service, pay invoices

**How It Works:**
- Customer sees their equipment history
- Request service online (auto-creates Jobber job)
- View/pay invoices
- Access training materials ("How to maintain your plotter")
- Track service request status

**ROI Potential:**
- Reduce Alyssa's call volume 20-30% = **$5,000-8,000/year**
- Faster payment collection = **cash flow improvement**

**Investment:** $12,000-18,000

---

#### 4.2 Predictive Maintenance AI
**Problem:** Reactive service = lost uptime for customers

**Solution:** Equipment data + AI to predict failures before they happen

**How It Works:**
- Meter readings tracked in Equipment CRM
- Machine learning identifies patterns (failure predictors)
- Alert customers before breakdown: "Your plotter shows signs of X, schedule maintenance now"
- Position as premium service differentiator

**ROI Potential:**
- Charge premium for predictive monitoring = **$20-50/mo per customer**
- 20 customers = **$4,800-12,000/year**

**Investment:** $15,000-25,000 (requires data history)

## Triggers to Start Phase 3

**Don't start Phase 3 until Phase 2 proves value:**

✅ **Go Signal (Start Phase 3):**
- Phase 2 delivered and working
- 30-60 day metrics show ROI
- Kelsey's training time reduced
- Equipment CRM actively used
- Ply integration working smoothly
- Steve hired or hiring in next 3 months
- Business needs next level of automation

⚠️ **Wait Signal (Not Yet):**
- Phase 2 not fully adopted
- Team still learning Phase 2 systems
- Budget constraints
- Business goals unclear
- Kelsey not ready for more change

---

## Phase 2 → Phase 3 Bridge

**Between Phase 2 completion and Phase 3 start:**

### Month 1-2 Post Phase 2:
- Monitor metrics (30-60 day validation)
- Collect feedback from Alyssa, Joe, Megan
- Identify pain points still not solved
- Validate ROI assumptions

### Month 3 Post Phase 2:
- Phase 3 scoping meeting with Kelsey/Nikki
- Prioritize modules based on business goals
- Budget approval
- Scope finalization

### Month 4+:
- Start Phase 3 build (if green light)

**Alternative:** Shift to retainer model instead of Phase 3 project

---

## Success Metrics (Phase 3)

### Revenue Metrics
- Monthly recurring revenue (contracts): $X → $Y
- Service revenue growth: X% increase
- Used parts revenue: $X/month recovered
- Customer lifetime value: $X → $Y

### Operational Metrics
- Kelsey's billable hours: X hrs/week → Y hrs/week
- Tech utilization rate: X% → Y%
- Customer satisfaction (NPS): X → Y
- Lead-to-close conversion: X% → Y%

### Scaling Metrics
- Technicians on team: X → Y
- Customers served per month: X → Y
- Average job value: $X → $Y
- Jobs completed per tech: X → Y

**Ultimate Goal:** Kelsey works 20-30 hrs/week (not 50-60) while revenue grows 30-50%

---

## Phase 3 vs. Retainer

| Factor | Phase 3 Project | Monthly Retainer |
|--------|-----------------|------------------|
| **Best for** | Clear growth goals, specific pain points | Ongoing optimization, unclear needs |
| **Investment** | $20k-80k (one-time) | $3k-5k/month |
| **Timeline** | 8-24 weeks | Ongoing (month-to-month) |
| **ROI** | Measurable, specific | Incremental, compounding |
| **Commitment** | Fixed scope | Flexible |

**Recommendation:** Start with Phase 3 project (3-4 modules), THEN shift to retainer for maintenance

## Open Questions for Phase 3 Planning

1. **Business Goals:** What's the 12-month revenue target? (Current: ~$600k)
2. **Team Goals:** How many techs does Kelsey want by end of year?
3. **Work-Life Goals:** How many hours/week does Kelsey want to work?
4. **Exit Strategy:** Is Kelsey building to sell? Or building for lifestyle?
5. **Andrew's Role:** Will supplies side become major revenue stream?
6. **Megan's Role:** Will she stay involved or exit after systems stabilize?
7. **Budget:** What's the appetite for continued investment in automation?

**These answers determine which Phase 3 modules make sense.**
