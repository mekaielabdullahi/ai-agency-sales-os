## Phase 1: Opening (5 min)

### Set the Frame
> "Kelsey, appreciate you making time. Here's what I'd like to do today - I want to understand exactly where you're at, what's working, what's not, and whether there's something we can do together that makes sense. If there's a fit, we'll talk about it. If not, no pressure. Sound fair?"

### Warm Alternative
> "Kelsey, good to see you. Before we dive in - how's the week been? Still running at full speed? ... [listen] ... Alright, let me ask you this - if we could fix one thing in the business right now, what would have the biggest impact?"

### Direct Alternative
> "Kelsey, I've been thinking about what you said last time - about becoming Arizona's premier wide-format service center. I want to understand what's standing between where you are now and that vision. Walk me through it."

---

## Phase 2: Situation Discovery (10 min)

*Goal: Get them talking about current state. You're gathering ammunition for later.*

### Current State Questions
1. > "Walk me through a typical week. What does Monday look like? Friday?"
2. > "How many hours are you personally putting in right now?"
3. > "When you look at those hours, how much is actual billable service work vs. everything else?"
4. > "Who else is in the operation? What's everyone's role?"

### Growth Questions
5. > "What's revenue looking like this year compared to last?"
6. > "Where do you want to be by end of year? In 3 years?"
7. > "You mentioned wanting to double - what needs to happen for that to be real?"
8. > "You're hiring 2 techs - what's driving that decision?"

### Operations Questions
9. > "How do jobs flow through the business right now? From first call to getting paid?"
10. > "Who handles what? When does something need your direct involvement?"
11. > "What systems are you running on? Jobber, email, what else?"

**Listen for:** Hours worked, revenue targets, hiring plans, bottlenecks, frustration signals.

---

## Phase 3: Problem Discovery (10 min)

*Goal: Surface the pain. Let them feel it. Don't solve yet.*

### Bottleneck Questions
12. > "You said you're at 70+ hours. What's eating up the time that isn't service work?"
13. > "When you're on a job, what pulls you away? Calls? Decisions only you can make?"
14. > "If you took a week off tomorrow, what would break?"

### Team Dependency Questions
15. > "You mentioned Joe - how often does he need to call you during a job?"
16. > "What percentage of his calls could he handle if he had the right information?"
17. > "When you train someone new, how long until they can work independently?"
18. > "What happens when you have to repeat the same explanation for the third time?"

### Operations Pain Questions
19. > "Alyssa's handling admin - what's taking most of her time?"
20. > "How many places do you have to check to know what's going on? Email, Jobber, texts?"
21. > "When something falls through the cracks, how do you usually find out?"
22. > "You said 'I make the process up every time.' What does that cost you?"

### The Frustration Question
23. > "What's the thing that frustrates you most about how the business runs right now?"

**Listen for:** Specific pain points, emotional weight, repeated themes.

---

## Phase 4: Quantify the Cost (5 min)

*Goal: Make the pain a number. This is where they sell themselves on the solution.*

### Time Cost
24. > "You said you spend [X hours] on [problem]. At your rate, that's what - $[calculate live] a week?"
25. > "If Joe needs you on 30% of calls, and you're doing 20 calls a week, that's 6 interruptions. What's that worth in lost productivity?"
26. > "Training those 2 new techs - how many hours do you expect that to take? At $175/hr..."

### Opportunity Cost
27. > "Every hour you spend on admin is an hour you're not billing. What's a service call worth?"
28. > "You want to double revenue. With the current operation, is that even possible? Or does something have to change first?"
29. > "What would 10 extra hours a week be worth if you could spend them on high-value work? Or with your family?"

### Future Cost
30. > "If nothing changes in the next 6 months, what does that look like?"
31. > "You're hiring 2 techs. Without a training system, you'll spend 400 hours getting them up to speed. That's $70,000 of your time. Is that the best use of it?"

### The Realization Question
32. > "When you add it up - the time, the interruptions, the training, the chaos - what do you think this is costing you per year?"

**Let them say the number.** If they lowball, help them calculate.

---

## Phase 5: Need-Payoff / Vision (5 min)

*Goal: Paint the picture of life after the problem is solved.*

### Vision Questions
33. > "If all of this was fixed - Joe handling calls independently, training happening without you, Alyssa not drowning in admin - what would you do with that time?"
34. > "You mentioned Pinetop. What would it take to actually run this business from there?"
35. > "What does 'Arizona's premier wide-format service center' actually look like? What's different from today?"
36. > "If you could snap your fingers and fix one thing, what would it be?"

### Value Confirmation
37. > "So if we could save you [X hours] a week, cut training time by 80%, and get your team operating without needing you on every call - would that be worth solving?"
38. > "What would that kind of transformation be worth to the business? Ballpark."

---

## Phase 6: Present the Solution (5 min)

*Goal: Bridge discovery directly to what you offer. Reference what they just told you.*

### The Bridge Statement
> "Okay, let me share what I'm thinking based on everything you just told me. You've got three problems:
> 1. [Their words] - costing you $X
> 2. [Their words] - costing you $Y
> 3. [Their words] - costing you $Z
>
> We built something specifically for this. Let me show you how it works."

### Solution Mapping
| They Said | You Solve With |
|-----------|----------------|
| "Joe needs me on 30% of calls" | Knowledge base - answers without calling Kelsey |
| "Training takes forever" | Video training system - train once, use forever |
| "Alyssa drowning in admin" | Operations platform - consolidate 10 inboxes to 2 |
| "I make it up every time" | Documented processes - consistent execution |
| "Can't scale without me" | AI assistant - Kelsey's brain available 24/7 |

### Present Tiers (Briefly)
> "There's three ways to approach this:
> - **Foundation ($15K)**: Fixes operations - Alyssa's productivity, basic systems
> - **Growth ($28K)**: Adds training system - new techs up to speed fast
> - **Full Scale ($42K)**: Complete transformation - knowledge platform, AI assistant, the whole thing
>
> Based on what you told me about [hiring 2 techs / wanting to double / needing to step back], I'd lean toward [tier]. But let me ask you - which of these sounds like the right fit?"

---

## Phase 7: Handle Concerns (5 min)

### "I need to think about it"
> "Totally fair. Help me understand - what specifically are you weighing? Is it the investment, the timing, or whether this will actually work?"
>
> [If investment]: "You told me this problem is costing you $[their number] per year. The question isn't whether you can afford to fix it - it's whether you can afford not to."
>
> [If timing]: "When would be a better time? After you've spent 400 hours training techs the old way? Or before?"
>
> [If trust]: "What would you need to see to feel confident this works?"

### "The price is high"
> "I get it. Let's look at the math you just gave me. Training 2 techs = 400 hours x $175 = $70,000 of your time. [Tier] costs less than half that and trains unlimited techs forever. Does that change how you see it?"

### "I'm too busy right now"
> "That's the problem, right? You're too busy because you're the bottleneck. Every week you wait, you're spending another [X hours] on stuff that shouldn't need you. When does that cycle break?"

### "I've tried systems before"
> "What didn't work? ... Here's the difference - we're not giving you a generic tool and hoping it fits. We literally documented how you use Jobber, how you mark messages for Alyssa, how you diagnose problems. This is built around YOUR workflow."

### "Let me talk to my team"
> "Good idea - Alyssa will be using this daily. What do you think her reaction will be when she hears about consolidating 10 inboxes into 2? Want to loop her into the next call, or should we talk to her now?"

---

## Phase 8: Close (5 min)

### Summary Close
> "Let me make sure I have this right. You're working 70+ hours, hiring 2 techs who need 400 hours of training, Alyssa's buried in 25 hours of admin, and Joe still needs you on a third of his calls. You told me this is costing you [$X] a year and it's the thing standing between you and doubling the business.
>
> [Tier] fixes all of that for [$price]. What's holding you back from starting?"

### Choice Close
> "Based on everything you shared, it sounds like [Growth/Full Scale] is the right fit - you get the training system for the new techs plus the operations fix for Alyssa. The only question is: do you want to start now while you're ramping up, or wait until after you've done it the hard way?"

### Assumptive Close
> "Here's what I'm thinking - let's start with [tier]. I'll send over the agreement today, we'll schedule kickoff for next week, and we can have quick wins deployed before the new techs start. What day works for kickoff?"

### Direct Close
> "Kelsey, you know the problem, you know the cost, you've seen the solution. Are you ready to move forward?"

## Key Numbers (Calculate Live)

| Metric | Value | How to Use |
|--------|-------|------------|
| Kelsey's hourly rate | $175/hr | Multiply by hours wasted |
| Opportunity cost rate | $300-500/hr | What he could bill as consultant |
| Training hours per tech | 150-200 hrs | x $175 = $26,250-$35,000 per tech |
| New techs coming | 2 | = $52,500-$70,000 training cost |
| Joe escalation rate | 30% | = 6+ interruptions/week |
| Alyssa admin hours | 25 hrs/week | x $25/hr = $625/week = $32,500/year |
| Non-billable hours | 30 hrs/week | x $175 = $5,250/week = $273,000/year |
| Revenue target | $1.7M (double) | "How do you get there with current ops?" |

## Their Words to Echo Back

Use their exact language. It builds trust and shows you listened.

> "I make the process up every time I do it, and therefore causing chaos and confusion."

> "If it goes like this throughout the rest of the year, I could see how we could double our income."

> "I see this business just exploding and blowing up my old one out of the water."

> "I'm gonna become Arizona's wide format premier service center."

## Transition Phrases

**From Situation → Problem:**
> "Okay, so that's how things work now. Let me ask you - what's not working the way you want it to?"

**From Problem → Cost:**
> "So that's clearly frustrating. Let's put a number on it. How much is this actually costing you?"

**From Cost → Solution:**
> "Alright, so we're talking about $[X] a year in lost time and opportunity. Let me show you what we built to fix exactly this."

**From Solution → Close:**
> "So that's how it works. Based on everything we talked about - does this feel like the right move?"
