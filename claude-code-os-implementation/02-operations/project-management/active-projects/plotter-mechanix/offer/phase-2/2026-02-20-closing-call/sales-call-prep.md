## Part 1: Opening Scripts

### Option A: Direct & Value-Focused
> "Kelsey, thanks for making time today. I know you're running at 100% capacity with 70+ hours a week, so I'll keep this tight. I sent over the Phase 2 executive summary - I'm curious what stood out to you, and if you have any questions before we talk next steps."

### Option B: Vision Callback
> "Kelsey, good to connect. Last time we talked you painted a picture - Arizona's premier wide-format service center, business running without you turning every wrench, eventually managing it from Pinetop. I put together Phase 2 with that vision in mind. What was your reaction when you went through it?"

### Option C: Urgency + Empathy
> "Kelsey, I know you're hiring 2 techs this month and that's 400 hours of training staring you in the face. Before you invest that time the old way, I wanted to walk through what we proposed and see where you're at. Have you had a chance to review the summary?"

### Option D: Collaborative/Consultative
> "Kelsey, appreciate you jumping on. The goal today is simple - I want to hear what resonated, what didn't make sense, and what concerns came up. Then we figure out together if this is the right move and which tier fits your situation. Sound good?"

### Option E: Warm & Personal
> "Kelsey, man, good to see you. Before we get into business - how's the week been? You still at 70 hours or did things calm down? ... [listen] ... Alright, let's make this time count. I put a lot of thought into that proposal based on everything you shared. Walk me through your honest reaction."

### Option F: Check-In First
> "Kelsey, appreciate you carving out time. Quick check before we dive in - anything change since we last talked? New fires, new hires, anything I should know about? ... [listen] ... Good to know. Alright, you've had a chance to sit with the Phase 2 summary. Let's hear it - what's on your mind?"

### Option G: Straight to Feedback
> "Kelsey, I'm not going to waste your time with small talk. You've seen the proposal - $15K, $28K, or $42K to transform your operations. Tell me straight: what's your gut saying?"

### Option H: Validation + Open Door
> "Kelsey, thanks for taking this call. I know you've got a lot on your plate - Alyssa processing 25 hours of communications, Joe still needing you on calls, and now two new techs coming in. I built Phase 2 to fix all of that. But before I say another word - I want to hear from you. What did you think?"

## Part 2: Comprehensive Feedback Questions

### Category 1: First Impressions
1. "What was your initial reaction when you read the executive summary?"
2. "What stood out most to you - positively or negatively?"
3. "Did anything surprise you in the proposal?"
4. "On a scale of 1-10, how excited are you about this? What would make it a 10?"

### Category 2: Value Understanding
5. "The $254K annual value projection - does that feel realistic to you?"
6. "Of the three deliverables - Training Center, Operations Platform, Inventory System - which one would move the needle most for you right now?"
7. "When you think about transforming from a $175/hr technician to a $300-500/hr consultant, what comes up for you?"
8. "We projected saving you 10-15 hours/week. What would you do with that time?"

### Category 3: Pain Validation
9. "You mentioned Joe still needs your help on 30% of calls. How much is that costing you weekly?"
10. "Alyssa's spending 25 hours/week processing communications. Is that number still accurate?"
11. "With 2 techs coming on, how many hours do you expect to spend training them the old way?"
12. "Last time you said 'I make the process up every time I do it, causing chaos and confusion.' Is that still the reality?"

### Category 4: Concerns & Objections
13. "What concerns do you have about moving forward?"
14. "Is there anything in the proposal that doesn't sit right with you?"
15. "What would need to be true for you to feel confident saying yes?"
16. "Who else needs to weigh in on this decision?"
17. "What's the biggest risk you see with this investment?"

### Category 5: Tier Selection
18. "When you look at Foundation ($15K), Growth ($28K), and Full Scale ($42K) - which feels like the right fit?"
19. "Is budget the main factor, or is it more about scope?"
20. "If money wasn't a constraint, which tier would you choose?"

### Category 6: Timing & Urgency
22. "What's driving your timeline here? Is there a deadline or event pushing this?"
23. "Every month you train techs the old way costs $26,250. Does that change your urgency?"
24. "If we started next week, when would you want to see first results?"
25. "What happens if you wait another 3-6 months on this?"

### Category 7: Vision Alignment
26. "The Pinetop dream - managing from the cabin. How far away does that feel right now?"
27. "You mentioned wanting to become Arizona's premier wide-format service center. How does Phase 2 fit into that?"

### Category 8: Process & Partnership
29. "Do you have questions about how we'd work together?"
30. "The support tiers show different response times and access levels. Does that make sense?"

## Part 3: Objection Handlers (Kelsey-Specific)

### "I need to think about it"
> "Totally get it. What specifically do you need to think through? Is it the investment, the timing, or whether this will actually work?"

### "The price is high"
> "I hear you. Let me ask - you're about to spend 400 hours training 2 techs. At $175/hr, that's $70,000 of your time. Phase 2 costs less than that AND trains unlimited techs forever. Does that change the calculation?"

### "I'm too busy to implement this right now"
> "That's exactly the problem Phase 2 solves. You're too busy because you're the bottleneck. The question is: do you want to stay too busy forever, or invest now to get your time back?"

### "I've tried systems before and they didn't stick"
> "What specifically didn't work last time? ... The difference here is we're building around YOUR workflow, not forcing you into a generic tool. We documented exactly how you use Jobber - screenshots, marking messages unread for Alyssa, all of it."

### "Let me talk to Alyssa/my team first"
> "Good call - she'll be using this daily. What do you think her biggest concern would be? ... Actually, should we loop her into the next conversation?"

### "What if it doesn't work?"
> "Fair question. Here's the reality - you can keep doing what you're doing, or you can build something that scales. The worst case with Phase 2 is you have documented training and better systems. What's the worst case if you keep going as-is?"

### "Can we start smaller?"
> "Absolutely - that's what Foundation is for. $15K gets operations fixed. You can add Growth components later if you see results. What matters most to you right now?"

### "I need to see more proof first"
> "I respect that. What would convince you? We can set up a pilot, show you the demo sites we've built, or walk through the ROI calculations together. What would help?"

---

## Part 4: Closing Approaches

### The Summary Close
> "So let me make sure I have this right. You're at 100% capacity, hiring 2 techs, Alyssa's drowning in 25 hours of admin, and Joe still needs you on 30% of calls. Phase 2 fixes all of that for less than one tech's training cost. What's holding you back from starting?"

### The Choice Close
> "It sounds like Foundation or Growth makes the most sense for where you are. Foundation gets operations fixed, Growth adds the training system. Which direction are you leaning?"

### The Urgency Close
> "You mentioned wanting to double revenue this year. We're already mid-February. If we start now, you're operational by summer. Wait another month, that pushes to fall. What's the best path forward?"

### The Risk Reversal
> "Here's the reality - you can keep doing what you're doing, or you can build something that scales. The worst case with Phase 2 is you have documented training and better systems. What's the worst case if you keep going as-is?"

### The Direct Ask
> "Based on everything we've discussed - are you ready to move forward? Which tier works for you?"

### The Next Step Close
> "Let's do this - I'll send over the agreement for [tier they chose]. We can schedule the kickoff call for next week. Sound good?"
