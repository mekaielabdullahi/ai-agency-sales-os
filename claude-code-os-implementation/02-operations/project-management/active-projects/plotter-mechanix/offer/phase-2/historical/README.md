# Historical / Superseded Documents

**⚠️ OUTDATED - DO NOT USE FOR DECISION MAKING**

**Purpose:** Archive of working documents that were superseded by the final proposal
**Audience:** Internal reference only - shows evolution of thinking
**Status:** Purely historical - information is OUT OF DATE

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: These Documents Are Outdated

**DO NOT reference these documents for current Phase 2 planning.**

These files contain earlier iterations, assumptions, or pricing that were **replaced** by the final proposal. They're kept for historical context only.

### ✅ **FOR CURRENT INFORMATION, USE:** `../to-review/`
- **PHASE-2-PROPOSAL.md** - Final client-facing proposal
- **VALIDATION-ACTION-PLAN.md** - Current validation process
- **QUICK-START-GUIDE.md** - Team execution guide

### 📚 **FOR CURRENT INTERNAL ANALYSIS, USE:** `../internal/`
- business-problems-analysis.md
- pricing-strategy.md
- quo-ply-integration-technical.md

|----------|---------------------|-------------|

| **implementation-plan.md** | Earlier timeline/deliverables iteration | PHASE-2-PROPOSAL.md timeline |
| **pricing-breakdown.md** | Earlier client-facing pricing structure | PHASE-2-PROPOSAL.md pricing section |
| **roi-validation-plan.md** | Earlier validation methodology | VALIDATION-ACTION-PLAN.md |

## Why We Keep These Files

### 1. **Institutional Knowledge**
Shows how our thinking evolved:
- Why we changed from $10k → $47k pricing
- What assumptions we validated or revised
- Why we added email automation and chat agent

### 2. **Audit Trail**
If client asks "Why did you decide X?":
- We can show the analysis that led to decisions
- Demonstrates thorough planning process

### 3. **Future Reference**
If we need to:
- Revisit pricing strategy
- Understand why we chose certain deliverables
- See what options were considered and rejected

## Evolution Timeline (What Changed)

### Initial Plan (gap-analysis.md era)
- $10k cost-plus pricing
- Tried to modify Quo UI directly
- 8-week timeline
- Build custom inventory system (competing with Ply)

### Mid-Planning (implementation-plan.md era)
- Realized Megan implementing Ply (don't compete)
- Discovered Quo UI constraint (can't modify)
- Added chat agent approach
- Compressed timeline to 4-6 weeks

### Final Plan (PHASE-2-PROPOSAL.md)
- $47k value-based pricing (AAA framework)
- Chat agent with tool access (solves Quo constraint)
- Support Megan's Ply (don't replace)
- Added email automation (was missing)
- Equipment CRM separate from parts inventory

## When to Reference These Files

### ✅ **OK to reference for:**
- Understanding how we got to final decisions
- Explaining our thought process to team
- Learning from what changed and why

### ❌ **DO NOT reference for:**
- Current pricing (use PHASE-2-PROPOSAL.md)
- Current timeline (use PHASE-2-PROPOSAL.md)
- Validation process (use VALIDATION-ACTION-PLAN.md)
- Technical decisions (check ../internal/ for current docs)

## Questions?

- **"Why keep these if they're outdated?"** → Institutional knowledge and audit trail
- **"Can I delete them?"** → No, keep for historical reference
- **"Which docs should I use?"** → Always use `../to-review/` for current information
- **"What if I accidentally reference these?"** → Team review will catch it
