## The Business Problems

### Problem 1: Kelsey's Time is Trapped in Low-Value Tasks

**Current State:**
> "I'm so exhausted of pouring myself into people. Joe is the last dude I'm pouring myself into." - Kelsey

**Baseline Metrics:**
- Kelsey spends **5 hours/week training Joe** (estimated)
- Kelsey's billable rate: **$300-375/hour**
- Annual cost of training: **$78,000/year** in lost billable time
- Time to train new technician: **4-6 weeks of Kelsey's direct involvement**

**Impact:**
- Can't hire Steve (no bandwidth to train)
- Can't take vacation (business stops without Kelsey)
- Can't focus on high-value work ($400+/hr opportunities)

---

### Problem 2: No Equipment Service History = Revenue Leakage

**Current State:**
> "The business lacks a system for tracking critical client data like serial numbers and maintenance history"

**Baseline Metrics:**
- **Zero equipment records** in centralized database
- Lost service contract opportunity: **PK Associates example ($5k-10k/year)**
- Eligible customers for service contracts: **~20 customers** (estimated)
- Contract revenue potential: **$23,760/year** ($99/mo × 20 customers)
- Customer churn: **Unknown %** (no tracking system)

**Impact:**
- Signing bad contracts (no history to evaluate)
- Missing proactive maintenance opportunities
- Customers leave because we're reactive, not proactive
- Can't prove value for service contract pricing

---

### Problem 3: "Do We Have X?" Kills Productivity Daily

**Current State:**
> "I don't know what we have here or there... it wastes a lot of time." - Kelsey

**Baseline Metrics:**
- Alyssa interrupted **~10 times/day** with inventory questions (estimated)
- Time per interruption: **~5 minutes** (estimated)
- Kelsey's hourly rate: **$300/hr**
- Daily cost: **$250/day** in Kelsey's time wasted
- Annual cost: **$62,500/year** (250 work days)

**Impact:**
- Can't quote accurately on phone
- Customer callbacks = slow sales cycle
- Kelsey interrupted during billable work
- Alyssa's time fragmented

---

### Problem 4: Used Parts Inventory is Lost Revenue

**Current State:**
> "$1,200 power supplies from parted-out machines lost without system"

**Baseline Metrics:**
- Used parts inventory: **$50,000** (estimated total value)
- Currently tracked: **$0** (no system)
- Revenue recovery potential: **10-20% of parted machine value**
- Annual opportunity: **$5,000-15,000/year**

**Impact:**
- Valuable parts sit unused or get lost
- Can't price used parts competitively (no cost basis)
- Buying new when we have used in stock
