# Plotter Mechanix - Business Problems Menu & 10x Scale Analysis

**Created:** January 24, 2026
**Purpose:** Map business problems → ongoing initiatives → our solutions
**Framework:** "If you were 10x your size tomorrow, what breaks?"

---

## Executive Summary

**Current State:** ~$600k revenue, 2-3 technicians, owner-operator model
**10x Vision:** $6M revenue, 20-30 technicians, systematized operations

**The Question:** What problems prevent you from scaling 10x?

**The Answer:** 5 categories of friction that compound with growth:
1. **Knowledge Transfer** (Kelsey is the bottleneck)
2. **Information Flow** (data trapped in silos)
3. **Inventory Visibility** (manual, reactive)
4. **Communication Overload** (email/calls/handoffs)
5. **Customer Intelligence** (service history scattered)

**Current Initiatives (Already Underway):**
- ✅ **Andrew:** Ramping up supplies side with domain knowledge
- ✅ **Megan:** Setting up Ply for inventory management
- ✅ **Phase 1:** Quo→Jobber workflow reducing Kelsey/Alyssa handoff friction

**Phase 2 Role:** Support these initiatives + fill the gaps + validate ROI

## The 10x Scale Test

### Current State: 1x Scale

| Metric | Current (1x) |
|--------|--------------|
| Revenue | ~$600,000/year |
| Technicians | 2-3 (Kelsey, Joe, potential Steve) |
| Admin | 1 (Alyssa) |
| Service calls/week | ~20-30 |
| Customers | ~100-200 active |
| Inventory SKUs | ~500-1000 items |
| Emails/day | ~50-100 (10 inboxes) |
| Calls/day | ~10-20 |

**What works today:**
- Kelsey knows every customer personally
- Alyssa manages all communication manually
- Inventory tracked on whiteboard + mental model
- Training = Kelsey shadowing new techs

---

### Future State: 10x Scale (Without Changes)

| Metric | 10x Scale |
|--------|-----------|
| Revenue | **$6,000,000/year** |
| Technicians | **20-30 techs** |
| Admin | **3-5 people** |
| Service calls/week | **200-300** |
| Customers | **1,000-2,000 active** |
| Inventory SKUs | **5,000-10,000 items** |
| Emails/day | **500-1,000** |
| Calls/day | **100-200** |

**What breaks at 10x:**
- ❌ Kelsey can't train 20 techs personally
- ❌ Alyssa can't manage 500 emails/day manually
- ❌ Whiteboard inventory can't track 10,000 SKUs
- ❌ Manual handoffs create 50+ dropped balls/week
- ❌ Service history in Kelsey's head doesn't scale

**Result:** Revenue ceiling at ~$1-2M before chaos sets in

---

## The 5 Business Problems (Menu)

### Problem 1: Knowledge Transfer Bottleneck

**The 1x Problem:**
- Kelsey trains every technician personally
- All expertise in Kelsey's head
- 5 hours/week training Joe
- Can't hire Steve (no bandwidth to train)

**The 10x Problem (What Breaks):**
- Need to train 20+ techs
- Kelsey's time = 100 hrs/week training (impossible)
- Business growth limited by Kelsey's availability
- Knowledge lost when Kelsey takes vacation

**Annual Cost at 1x:** $78,000/year (5 hrs/week × $300/hr)
**Annual Cost at 10x:** $1,560,000/year (impossible to sustain)

**Current Initiative:** None (blocked)

**Our Solution:** Training System
- Chris films Kelsey during service calls
- 25-30 video library covering common procedures
- Knowledge base with searchable SOPs
- New techs onboard in 2-3 weeks (vs 4-6 weeks)

**ROI Validation:**
- [ ] Track Kelsey's actual training time with Joe (5-day study)
- [ ] Measure: How long did Joe take to onboard? (interview Kelsey)
- [ ] Calculate: Time saved per new hire × planned hires

**Investment:** $18,000
**Expected ROI:** $39,000/year savings (50% training time reduction)

---

### Problem 2: Information Flow Silos

**The 1x Problem:**
- Data trapped in separate systems:
  - Quo (calls)
  - Jobber (jobs, invoices)
  - Ply (inventory - Megan setting up)
  - QuickBooks (accounting)
  - Email (vendor communications, pricing, RMAs)
- Alyssa context-switches 50+ times/day
- "Do we have X?" requires checking Ply manually
- Equipment service history scattered

**The 10x Problem (What Breaks):**
- 5 admin staff each managing different systems
- 500+ context switches/day = 20+ hours wasted
- Customer calls take 3x longer (looking up info)
- Quotes delayed by 24-48 hours (data buried)
- Can't answer "What's our revenue this month?" without manual export

**Annual Cost at 1x:** $??,000/year (need to validate Alyssa's context-switching time)
**Annual Cost at 10x:** $100,000-200,000/year in admin overhead

**Current Initiative:**
- ✅ **Megan:** Setting up Ply for inventory
- ✅ **Phase 1:** Quo→Jobber workflow (reduced handoff friction)

**Our Solution:** Unified Chat Agent
- Single interface for ALL data queries
- Tool access to: Ply, Quo, Jobber, QuickBooks, Equipment CRM
- Anyone at company can ask:
  - "Do we have HP 730 ink in stock?" → Queries Ply
  - "Show me ABC Graphics service history" → Queries Equipment CRM + Jobber
  - "What's our revenue this month?" → Queries QuickBooks
  - "Are there any open POs for Canon parts?" → Queries email + Jobber

**How This Supports Megan's Ply Work:**
- Ply stays as inventory system of record (Megan's domain)
- Chat agent queries Ply via API (doesn't replace it)
- Adds context from other systems Ply doesn't have (customer history, service records)

**ROI Validation:**
- [ ] Track Alyssa's context-switching time (5-day study)
- [ ] Count: How many times/day does she switch between systems?
- [ ] Measure: Time to find customer info (before/after)

**Investment:** $10,000
**Expected ROI:** $25,000-40,000/year (time savings + faster quotes)

---

### Problem 3: Inventory Visibility & Management

**The 1x Problem:**
- Manual tracking (whiteboard + Ply being set up by Megan)
- "Do we have X?" = Kelsey interrupted 10 times/day
- Used parts from parted machines = $50k invisible inventory
- Vendor pricing updates buried in emails
- No visibility into stock levels during customer calls

**The 10x Problem (What Breaks):**
- 10,000 SKUs can't be tracked on whiteboard
- 100+ "Do we have X?" interruptions/day = 8 hours wasted
- $500k in lost/untracked inventory
- Miss vendor pricing changes = margin erosion
- Stockouts kill customer satisfaction at scale

**Annual Cost at 1x:** $62,500/year (10 interruptions/day × 5 min × $300/hr)
**Annual Cost at 10x:** $625,000/year (100 interruptions/day)

**Current Initiative:**
- ✅ **Megan:** Setting up Ply for parts inventory, job material tracking, stock alerts

**Our Role (Ply Enhancement Layer):**

**What Ply Does (Megan's Domain):**
- Parts inventory tracking
- Job material tracking
- Stock alerts
- Jobber sync
- Purchase orders
- Cycle counts

**What Ply Doesn't Do (Our Opportunity):**
| Gap | Our Solution |
|-----|--------------|
| Equipment serial #s & service history | Equipment CRM |
| Used parts from parted machines | Used parts tracking module |
| Quo call context (inventory during calls) | Chat agent Ply integration |
| Printer-specific workflow needs | Custom Ply configuration support |
| Vendor pricing email extraction | Email automation |

**How We Support Megan:**
1. Interview to understand Ply implementation status
2. Fill gaps Ply doesn't cover
3. Build integrations Ply needs (Quo context, email pricing)
4. Don't duplicate what she's already building

**ROI Validation:**
- [ ] Track "Do we have X?" interruptions (5-day Alyssa log)
- [ ] Confirm used parts inventory value with Megan
- [ ] Validate Ply implementation % complete (Megan interview)

**Investment:** $8,000 (Ply enhancements + used parts tracking)
**Expected ROI:** $21,000-55,000/year (interruption reduction + used parts recovery)

---

### Problem 4: Communication Overload

**The 1x Problem:**
- Alyssa manages 10 email inboxes manually
- Vendor pricing updates buried in PDFs
- RMA communications scattered across threads
- Purchase orders lost in email
- Manual email processing = ?? hours/week

**The 10x Problem (What Breaks):**
- 500-1,000 emails/day (10x volume)
- 5 admin staff each managing different vendors
- Critical pricing changes missed = margin loss
- RMAs take weeks instead of days
- PO tracking chaos

**Annual Cost at 1x:** $??,000/year (need to validate Alyssa's email time)
**Annual Cost at 10x:** $50,000-100,000/year in admin overhead

**Current Initiative:** None (manual)

**Our Solution:** Email Automation
- N8N monitors vendor email inboxes (HP, Canon, Epson, Roland, etc.)
- Extracts pricing from PDFs/attachments
- Auto-updates inventory system with new costs
- Flags RMAs for action (routes to Alyssa)
- Categorizes POs and links to Jobber jobs
- Alerts on critical communications

**Integration Points:**
| From | To | Action |
|------|-----|--------|
| Vendor pricing emails | Ply/inventory system | Auto-update costs |
| RMA emails | Alyssa's task list | Flag for action |
| PO confirmations | Jobber | Link to job, update status |
| Critical vendor alerts | Chat agent | Notify team |

**ROI Validation:**
- [ ] Track Alyssa's email processing time (5-day study)
- [ ] Count: How many vendor emails/day need manual processing?
- [ ] Measure: Time spent extracting pricing, routing RMAs, filing POs

**Investment:** $5,000
**Expected ROI:** $10,000-20,000/year (50-80% email processing time reduction)

---

### Problem 5: Customer Intelligence Gap

**The 1x Problem:**
- Equipment service history in Kelsey's head
- No central database of customer equipment (serial #s, models, install dates)
- Can't identify service contract eligible customers
- Reactive service only (no proactive maintenance)
- Manual lookup during customer calls

**The 10x Problem (What Breaks):**
- 2,000 customers = impossible to remember histories
- Miss proactive maintenance revenue (20% of potential)
- Sign bad service contracts (no history to evaluate)
- Customer churn from reactive-only service
- New techs can't access equipment knowledge

**Annual Cost at 1x:** $30,000-50,000/year (missed contract revenue + churn)
**Annual Cost at 10x:** $300,000-500,000/year

**Current Initiative:** None (Ply tracks parts, not customer equipment)

**Our Solution:** Equipment CRM
- Customer equipment database (serial #s, models, install dates)
- Maintenance history log (what was done, when, by whom, parts used)
- Service contract eligibility scoring
- Proactive maintenance reminders
- Integration with Jobber (link equipment to jobs)
- Accessible via Chat agent during calls

**Example Use Case:**

**Customer calls:** "My HP T730 is showing an error."

**Alyssa sees in Chat agent:**
```
📞 ABC Graphics calling
🔧 Equipment: HP T730 (Serial: ABC123, Installed: 2022)
📅 Last Service: Jan 15, 2026 (Maintenance kit replacement)
🔔 Meter Reading: 45,000 prints (due for service at 50,000)
💰 Service Contract: Eligible (3+ services/year, equipment value $8k)
📦 Parts in stock: ✅ T730 maintenance kit, ✅ Printhead
```

**ROI Validation:**
- [ ] Count customers with 3+ service calls/year (Jobber data)
- [ ] Calculate contract revenue potential ($99/mo × eligible customers)
- [ ] Track time to look up equipment history (5-day Alyssa study)

**Investment:** $10,000
**Expected ROI:** $37,600-52,000/year (contract revenue + retention improvement)
