# Freeing Kelsey to Build a $1.7M Business
## (Without Breaking Himself)

**Presented by:** Arise Group AI
**Date:** February 2026
**Investment:** $12,000 - $38,000 (3 tier options)
**Timeline:** 4-6 weeks
**Expected ROI:** $30,000 - $198,000/year (validated with your team's input)

## Executive Summary

Every stakeholder we interviewed said the same thing in different words:

> *"I wish he would spend more time running the business instead of working in it... go out and make connections... that's what he's really good at."*
> — **Nikki**

Phase 1 proved we deliver — Quo-Jobber integration is deployed and Kelsey chose Quo as his default phone. Now Phase 2 addresses the single biggest blocker to Kelsey's Pinetop dream: **everything goes in and out of Kelsey.**

**The Goal is Simple:** Give Kelsey back 10+ hours per week to focus on what he's actually great at — networking, making deals, and growing a business that can run without him in the field every day.

**The Pinetop Test:** Can Kelsey take a week off while the business runs?

## The Kelsey Bottleneck

Your team told us what's really going on:

### 1. Kelsey is the Only One Who Knows Everything

> *"Everything goes in and out of Kelsey. It's a technical constraint beyond belief."*
> — **Megan**

| Problem | Business Impact | Source |
|---------|-----------------|--------|
| Training new techs | $21,000-$35,000 in lost billable time per hire | Joe: 20-30 hrs/wk × first 3-4 weeks (tapers) |
| Knowledge gaps | 30% of calls need Kelsey | Joe: 20% + 10-15% minor guidance |
| Single point of failure | Can't scale, can't step back | Every stakeholder interview |

### 2. Alyssa is Drowning

> *"Kelsey was calling me over like half hour. Clients were calling... one thing after the other without any breaks."*
> — **Alyssa**

| Problem | Business Impact | Source |
|---------|-----------------|--------|
| Kelsey calls | 5-8 daily updates | Alyssa interview |
| Managing 10 email inboxes | Constant context switching | Alyssa interview |
| Can't take time off | Brings laptop on vacation | Alyssa interview |

### 3. Data Lives in Too Many Places

> *"I have to keep pestering, like, hey, where's the tracking? Or maybe I miss it in the emails because I have, like, how many inboxes do we have, like 10?"*
> — **Alyssa**

| Problem | Business Impact | Source |
|---------|-----------------|--------|
| Parts tracking chaos | ~$50k in used parts untracked | Joe interview |
| No unified data access | Everyone calls Kelsey | All interviews |
| 10 email inboxes | Constant context switching | Alyssa interview |

### 4. Nikki's Time is Being Wasted

> *"I don't want to do this. Like, this isn't my goal. I'm only doing this because he needs somebody to do it... I'm applying to law school."*
> — **Nikki**

Nikki spends 25-30 hours/week on bookkeeping she doesn't want to do, because the last person who did it stole money. That's a trust problem, not a Nikki problem.

## The Real Cost of the Kelsey Bottleneck

Let's do the math on what this is costing you:

### Kelsey's Rates

**Billable Rates (from Jobber):**
- Trip charge: $75/trip
- Service call: **$175/hr**

**Opportunity Cost (Revenue-Based):**
Based on your projected revenue of $1.2M-$1.7M and assuming Kelsey works 50-hour weeks:
- Revenue ÷ Hours = $462-$654/hr potential
- Conservative estimate (accounting for overhead): **$300-375/hr**

Every hour Kelsey spends doing work someone else could do costs this much.

### Annual Cost of the Bottleneck

| Time Drain | Hours | Cost at $175/hr | Opportunity Cost |
|------------|-------|-----------------|------------------|
| Training new tech (each) | 120-200 hrs (front-loaded over 3 months) | $21,000-$35,000 | $36,000-$75,000 |
| Morning coordination | 375-500 hrs/yr | $65,625-$87,500 | $112,500-$187,500 |
| Joe help calls (30%) | 150-200 hrs/yr | $26,250-$35,000 | $45,000-$75,000 |
| Alyssa update calls | 100-150 hrs/yr | $17,500-$26,250 | $30,000-$56,250 |

**February 2026 Reality (2 new techs):**
- 25 hrs/wk × 2 techs × 4 weeks = **200 hours** of Kelsey's time in the first month
- At $175/hr = **$35,000** in lost service revenue

**Total:** The Kelsey bottleneck is costing you **$200,000+ per year** in high-value time.

## The Solution: Clone Kelsey (Digitally)

Phase 2 delivers three things:

### 1. Unified Company Brain
Connect ALL your data into one voice-friendly interface:
- **Jobber** (jobs/scheduling)
- **Ply** (inventory — Megan is implementing)
- **QuickBooks** (finance)
- **Quo** (calls — Phase 1 delivered)
- **Emails** (vendor pricing, RMAs, POs)

**The Key:** Voice-first design for Kelsey's way of working.

> *"I can't learn on the fly with software I've never seen before. I can't even see the buttons on the screen."*
> — **Kelsey**

Kelsey's dyslexia isn't a limitation — it's a design requirement. No typing. No clicking through menus. No reading walls of text. Just talk and get answers.

### 2. Clone Kelsey Training System

> *"If you follow him for a year and you record every single service call, I think that's what's going to change the business from him working in it to being able to work away from it."*
> — **Nikki**

We won't wait a year. We'll capture the top 25-30 repair scenarios Joe identified:
- Technical parts replacements
- Diagnostic flowcharts
- Post-repair procedures
- Service mode operations
- Non-HP equipment (Joe's gap areas)

**Joe's preference:** Self-paced video learning, not live training. He wants to review complex procedures on his own time.

**ROI:** Reduce 120-200 hours per new tech hire to 30-50 hours. Savings of $15,750-$26,250 per hire at billable rates.

### 3. Operations Cleanup
- Automate email extraction for vendor pricing/RMAs
- Reduce Alyssa's 10-inbox chaos
- Equipment database for customer service history
- Streamline morning coordination workflow

## Success Metrics

### The Nikki Test: "10 Hours Back"

| Metric | Current | 30-Day | 90-Day |
|--------|---------|--------|--------|
| Training hrs/week (per new tech) | 20-30 (first month) | 10 hrs | 5 hrs |
| Joe help requests | 30% | 20% | 10% |
| Alyssa update calls | 5-8/day | 2-3/day | 1-2/day |
| Morning coordination | 1.5-2 hrs | 1 hr | 30 min |
| **Total Kelsey Time Freed** | 0 hrs/week | 5+ hrs/week | **10+ hrs/week** |

### The Pinetop Test

By 90 days, Kelsey should be able to:
- Take a 3-day weekend without constant calls
- Let Joe handle 85%+ of service calls independently
- Review business performance from anywhere
- Focus on networking and growth, not firefighting

## Why This Investment Makes Sense Now

### The Window is Open

> *"We're not just trying to keep up with the calls... I want him to be able to go out and create more business, make more connections, network with people, and that's where the growth is."*
> — **Nikki**

You're projecting to double revenue this year. The market tailwind from competitor supply chain issues won't last forever. The question isn't whether to build this infrastructure — it's whether you build it before or after you hit a wall.

### Joe is Ready

Joe identified exactly what he needs:
- Video tutorials (his preference over live training)
- Mobile RAG agent for field queries (his request)
- Troubleshooting flowcharts
- Coverage for his specific gaps (solvent printers, Epson, UV curable)

He's enthusiastic and ready to test everything.

### The Math is Clear

**Training one new tech without system:**
- 20-30 hrs/week × first 3-4 weeks = 80-120 hours (plus taper period = 120-200 total)
- At $175/hr billable rate = $21,000 - $35,000 per hire in lost revenue
- That's 55-92% of the Full Scale investment for ONE hire

**February 2026 example (2 new techs):**
- 25 hrs × 2 techs × 4 weeks = 200 hours = **$35,000** in lost service revenue

**With our system:**
- Self-paced videos Joe requested
- 70-85% reduction in Kelsey's involvement
- ROI on first hire alone

---

## Your Protection

### Technical Guarantees
- Knowledge base accessible on mobile devices (voice-friendly)
- Training videos covering Joe's priority topics
- Equipment database integrated with Jobber
- Email automation for vendor pricing extraction

### Validation Checkpoints
- Week 1: Equipment database structure live
- Week 2: First videos reviewed by Joe
- Week 4: Joe testing mobile RAG agent
- Week 6: Full team trained and confident

### What We DON'T Guarantee
- Team adoption (but Joe's enthusiasm suggests high adoption)
- Behavior change (but systems work regardless)

---

## The Bottom Line

Your team told us what you need:

| Stakeholder | What They Said | What It Means |
|-------------|----------------|---------------|
| **Nikki** | "10 hours for higher leverage things" | Kelsey needs time back |
| **Nikki** | "Pinetop dream — sipping coffee on the balcony" | Freedom is the goal |
| **Alyssa** | "One thing after the other without any breaks" | Operations need relief |
| **Joe** | "20-30 hrs/week initially... 3 months to ramp" | Knowledge transfer is broken |
| **Megan** | "Everything goes in and out of Kelsey" | Single point of failure |
| **Kelsey** | "Can't learn on the fly with software" | Voice-first is required |

Every tier pays for itself in year one. The Full Scale option could pay for itself with the time savings from a single new tech hire.

**The question isn't whether to do Phase 2. It's how comprehensive you want the solution to be.**
