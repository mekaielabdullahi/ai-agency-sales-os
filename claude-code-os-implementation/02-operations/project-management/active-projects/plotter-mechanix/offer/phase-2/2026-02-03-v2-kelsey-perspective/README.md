# Phase 2 Proposal v2 - Kelsey Perspective

## The Core Shift

This version reframes the Phase 2 proposal from **Kelsey's business owner perspective** rather than Joe's field tech perspective.

| Original Framing | New Framing |
|------------------|-------------|
| "Building Infrastructure That Scales to 10x" | "Freeing Kelsey to Build a $1.7M Business" |
| Joe's field problems | Kelsey's business bottleneck |
| Technical deliverables | Business owner freedom |
| Training efficiency | "Clone Kelsey" to scale |
| Chat agent capabilities | Voice-friendly interface (dyslexia constraint) |

## Key Stakeholder Quotes Used

These direct quotes drive the narrative:

1. **Nikki:** *"I wish he would spend more time running the business instead of working in it... go out and make connections... that's what he's really good at"*

2. **Nikki:** *"Saving him about 10 hours to do those higher leverage things would be like a success"*

3. **Nikki (Pinetop vision):** *"He could be making money by sitting on his balcony, sipping his coffee"*

4. **Kelsey (dyslexia):** *"I can't learn on the fly with software I've never seen before. I can't even see the buttons on the screen."*

5. **Kelsey (cash flow):** *"I don't even know how I'm gonna pay you, but I will."*

6. **Alyssa:** *"Kelsey was calling me over like half hour. Clients were calling... one thing after the other without any breaks"*

7. **Megan:** *"Everything goes in and out of Kelsey. It's a technical constraint beyond belief."*

8. **Joe:** *"First 3 months required 20-30 hours/week of Kelsey's time"* (training)

9. **Joe:** *"20% of calls need Kelsey's help... another 10-15% need minor guidance"* (knowledge gaps)

10. **Joe:** *"1.5-2 hours every morning planning routes... 'Most frustrating part of my day'"* (morning coordination)

## Pricing Adjustment

Prices reduced from original to address cash flow sensitivity:

| Tier | Original | New | Reduction |
|------|----------|-----|-----------|
| Foundation | $15,000 | $12,000 | -$3,000 |
| Growth | $28,000 | $22,000 | -$6,000 |
| Full Scale | $47,000 | $38,000 | -$9,000 |

## Critical Design Constraints

### Kelsey's Dyslexia
All interfaces must be:
- Voice-first (no reading required)
- Conversational (natural language)
- Simple (minimal buttons)
- Consistent patterns

**Validation:** Kelsey already uses voice texting while driving and chose Quo as default phone.

### Cash Flow Sensitivity
- Payment plan options available
- Upgrade path from Foundation
- Quick wins in Week 1 to show value fast
