## Focused Validation Questionnaires

### Kelsey Interview (60-90 min) - FULL QUESTIONNAIRE

Use the complete questionnaire provided. Priority sections in order:

1. **Section 1: Time & Labor** (T1-T14) - CRITICAL
2. **Section 2: Service Operations** (S1-S8) - CRITICAL
3. **Section 6: Financial Baseline** (F1-F13) - CRITICAL
4. **Section 4: Training & Delegation** (D1-D13) - HIGH
5. **Section 3: Phone & Communication** (P1-P16) - MEDIUM
6. **Section 5: Inventory & Parts** (I1-I14) - MEDIUM
7. **Section 7: Customers & Contracts** (C1-C13) - MEDIUM
8. **Section 10: Strategic Goals** (G1-G8) - LOW (but good for framing)

### Joe Follow-up (15 min) - SHORT VALIDATION

We need to clarify the training taper pattern:

| # | Question | Why It Matters |
|---|----------|----------------|
| 1 | After your first month (20-30 hrs/wk), what did training drop to in month 2? | Validate taper rate |
| 2 | And in month 3, how many hours/week were you still getting trained? | Complete the pattern |
| 3 | When did it drop to "less than 10%" of Kelsey's time? | Confirm endpoint |
| 4 | How many total hours do you estimate Kelsey invested in training you? | Cross-check calculation |

**Current assumption:**
- Month 1: 100 hrs (25/wk × 4)
- Month 2: 50 hrs (12.5/wk × 4)
- Month 3: 30 hrs (7.5/wk × 4)
- Total: ~180 hrs

### Alyssa Follow-up (10 min) - SHORT VALIDATION

| # | Question | Why It Matters |
|---|----------|----------------|
| 1 | What's your hourly rate? | Automation ROI calculation |
| 2 | Confirm: 5-8 Kelsey calls per day, 5-10 min each? | Verify interview data |
| 3 | How much time do you spend on the Shopify-to-Jobber order translation per week? | Quantify if we add this |

### Nikki Follow-up (10 min) - SHORT VALIDATION

| # | Question | Why It Matters |
|---|----------|----------------|
| 1 | What was last year's actual revenue? | Baseline for all ROI |
| 2 | What's the 2026 revenue target? | Growth goal |
| 3 | How many hours/week does Kelsey actually work? | Validate our 50 hr assumption |

## Proposal Numbers That Need Validation

| $21K-$35K cost per hire | 120-200 hrs × $175 | Depends on above |
| 2-3 hires/year | Assumption | Confirm with Kelsey (D10, G2) |

### Knowledge Base ROI

|----------------|----------|-------------------|
| 30% of calls need help | Joe interview | VALIDATED |
| 2-3 daily interruptions | Joe interview | VALIDATED |
| $300-375/hr opportunity cost | Revenue / hours assumption | Validate revenue (F1) |

### Morning Coordination ROI

| Proposal Claim | Based On | Validation Needed |
|----------------|----------|-------------------|
| 1.5-2 hrs/day | Joe interview | VALIDATED |
| 4 of 5 days | Joe interview | VALIDATED |
| Reduction to 30 min | Assumption | Based on system design |

### Alyssa Time Recovery ROI

| Proposal Claim | Based On | Validation Needed |
|----------------|----------|-------------------|
| 5-8 Kelsey calls/day | Alyssa interview | VALIDATED |
| 5-10 min per call | Alyssa interview | VALIDATED |

## Pre-Call Checklist

Before the Kelsey call, ensure:

- [ ] Joe follow-up complete (taper pattern clarified)
- [ ] Alyssa follow-up complete (hourly rate, call frequency confirmed)
- [ ] Nikki follow-up complete (revenue baseline, Kelsey hours)
- [ ] Print Kelsey questionnaire with priority sections highlighted
- [ ] Have calculator ready for real-time ROI adjustments
- [ ] Record the call for transcript

---

## Post-Validation Actions

After all interviews complete:

1. **Update ROI calculations** with validated numbers
2. **Recalculate tier pricing** if ROI changes significantly
3. **Update proposal** with actual quotes and numbers
4. **Prepare final presentation** with "YOUR data shows..." framing

---

## Risk: What If Numbers Don't Support $38K?

| Scenario | Action |
|----------|--------|
| ROI drops below $80K/year | Reduce to Growth tier ($22K) as default |
| Training hours lower than expected | Shift emphasis to Knowledge Base ROI |
| Revenue lower than $1M | Reframe as % of revenue (3-4% investment) |
| Kelsey works fewer hours | Opportunity cost argument weakens - shift to quality of life |
