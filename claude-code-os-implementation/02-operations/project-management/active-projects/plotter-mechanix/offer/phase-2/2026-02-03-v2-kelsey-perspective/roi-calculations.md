# Phase 2 ROI Calculations - Kelsey Perspective
## Every Number Traced to a Stakeholder Quote

**Updated:** February 2026
**Validation Sources:** Nikki, Alyssa, Joe, Megan, Kelsey interviews

---

## Executive Summary

The ROI for Phase 2 centers on one metric: **freeing Kelsey's time**.

Nikki defined success as:
> *"Saving him about 10 hours to do those higher leverage things would be like a success."*

At Kelsey's effective rate of $300-375/hr, 10 hours/week = **$156,000-$195,000/year** in freed capacity.

## Kelsey's Hourly Rates

### Billable Rates (from Jobber)

| Service Type | Rate | Source |
|--------------|------|--------|
| Trip charge | $75/trip | Jobber pricing |
| Service call | $175/hr | Jobber pricing |

### Effective Rate (Revenue-Based)

| Metric | Low Estimate | High Estimate | Source |
|--------|--------------|---------------|--------|
| Projected Revenue | $1,200,000 | $1,700,000 | Kelsey: 2026-01-27 call |
| Working Hours/Year | 2,600 (50 hr/wk) | 2,600 | Industry standard |
| Gross Rate | $462/hr | $654/hr | Revenue ÷ Hours |
| Net Rate (after overhead) | $300/hr | $375/hr | Conservative 65% |

**Used for calculations:** $300-$375/hr for Kelsey's opportunity cost (not billable rate)

### Supporting Evidence

> *"Revenue doubling target — aiming to surpass previous $1.7M peak."*
> — Kelsey Operations Update, 2026-01-27

> *"This morning, he got up at 4, went to Bible study, delivered a plotter... won't get home till six o'clock tonight... yesterday he drove all the way to Prescott and back."*
> — Nikki

Kelsey's 12-14 hour days represent unsustainable output that must be recaptured for growth.

## ROI by Deliverable

### 1. Training System - Investment: $8,000-$18,000 (tier-dependent)

#### The Problem (Joe's Validation)

> *"Like 20, 30 hours, 20, 30 hours initially... it took me, like, a good three months, I'd say."*
> — Joe Interview, 2026-01-28

**Clarified Training Pattern:**
- **First 3-4 weeks:** 20-30 hrs/week (intensive)
- **Weeks 5-8:** Tapers to 10-15 hrs/week
- **Weeks 9-12:** Tapers to 5-10 hrs/week
- **After 12 weeks:** <10% of Kelsey's time

| Metric | Value | Calculation |
|--------|-------|-------------|
| Peak training (first month) | 80-120 hours | 20-30 hrs/wk × 4 weeks |
| Taper period (months 2-3) | 40-80 hours | Declining intensity |
| **Total per new tech** | **120-200 hours** | Front-loaded, then tapers |
| Kelsey's billable cost | $21,000-$35,000/hire | 120-200 hrs × $175/hr |
| Kelsey's opportunity cost | $36,000-$75,000/hire | 120-200 hrs × $300-$375/hr |

**February 2026 Example (2 new techs):**
- 25 hrs/wk × 2 techs × 4 weeks = **200 hours** of Kelsey's time
- At $175/hr billable = **$35,000** in lost service revenue
- At $300/hr opportunity = **$60,000** in capacity cost

#### The Solution ROI

| Metric | Current | With System | Savings |
|--------|---------|-------------|---------|
| Training time/hire | 120-200 hrs | 30-50 hrs | 90-150 hrs |
| Dollar value/hire (billable) | $21,000-$35,000 | $5,250-$8,750 | $15,750-$26,250 |
| With 2-3 hires/year | $42,000-$105,000 | $10,500-$26,250 | **$31,500-$78,750/yr** |

#### Training Content (Joe's Priorities)

> *Joe prefers video tutorials over live training (can review, better retention).*
> — Joe Interview, 2026-01-28

Joe identified his training gaps:
1. Solvent printers
2. Epson equipment
3. UV curable systems
4. Ink assemblies
5. Non-HP equipment generally

**Confidence:** HIGH (validated by Joe's actual onboarding: 20-30 hrs/wk × first 3-4 weeks, tapering over 3 months)

### 2. Unified Company Brain / Knowledge Base - Investment: $8,000-$12,000

#### The Problem (Joe's Validation)

> *"20% of calls need Kelsey's help... another 10-15% need minor guidance."*
> — Joe Interview, 2026-01-28

| Metric | Value | Source |
|--------|-------|--------|
| Jobs needing Kelsey help | 30-35% | Joe: 20% major + 10-15% minor |
| Average interruption time | 10-15 min | Joe: context switch + call |
| Daily interruptions | 2-3 | 7+ calls/day × 30% |
| Daily time lost | 30-45 min | 2-3 × 10-15 min |

#### The Solution ROI

| Metric | Current | With System | Savings |
|--------|---------|-------------|---------|
| Help calls | 30% of jobs | 10% of jobs | 20% reduction |
| Daily interruptions | 2-3 | <1 | 2+ interruptions |
| Daily time | 30-45 min | 10 min | 20-35 min |
| Annual hours | 125-188 hrs | 42-63 hrs | 83-125 hrs |
| Annual value | $25,000-$70,000 | $13,000-$24,000 | **$12,000-$46,000/yr** |

#### Design Requirement (Kelsey's Constraint)

> *"I can't learn on the fly with software I've never seen before. I can't even see the buttons on the screen."*
> — Kelsey, 2026-01-27

**Critical Design Constraint:** Voice-first interface, conversational queries, minimal buttons.

> *"He already uses voice texting while driving and chose Quo as default phone."*
> — Kelsey Operations Update

**Confidence:** HIGH (validated by Joe's explicit request for mobile RAG agent)

---

### 3. Operations Cleanup - Investment: $3,000-$6,000

#### 3a. Email Automation

> *"I have to keep pestering, like, hey, where's the tracking? Or maybe I miss it in the emails because I have, like, how many inboxes do we have, like 10?"*
> — Alyssa Interview

| Metric | Value | Source |
|--------|-------|--------|
| Inboxes managed | ~10 | Alyssa interview |
| Email processing/day | 2+ hours | Alyssa: constant context switching |
| RMA tracking issues | Ongoing | Megan: process broken |
| Vendor pricing extraction | Manual | Alyssa: PDF to Jobber |

**ROI: $8,000-$15,000/year in recovered admin time**
**Confidence:** MEDIUM (volume confirmed, time tracking needed)

#### 3b. Morning Coordination

> *"1.5-2 hours every morning planning routes... Routes change 4 out of 5 days... 'Most frustrating part of my day.'"*
> — Joe Interview, 2026-01-28

| Metric | Current | With System | Savings |
|--------|---------|-------------|---------|
| Daily coordination | 1.5-2 hrs | 30-45 min | 1-1.25 hrs |
| Weekly savings | 5-6.25 hrs | — | 5-6.25 hrs |
| Annual savings | 250-313 hrs | — | 250-313 hrs |
| Annual value | — | — | **$12,500-$15,625/yr** |

**Confidence:** HIGH (Joe validated daily, quantified time)

---

### 4. Equipment Management - Investment: $4,000-$8,000

#### The Problem

> *"Jobber missing customer equipment lists... Can't update profiles in field... No tech expertise mapping."*
> — Joe Interview, 2026-01-28

Joe's capability assessment:
- HP: 70-80% confident
- Graphtec cutters: Strong
- Solvent printers: Needs help
- Epson: Needs help
- UV curable: Needs help
- Ink assemblies: Needs help

#### The Solution ROI

| Andrew onboarding | Already in progress; leverage existing work |
| Kelsey consistency | Voice-first design reduces learning curve |
| Cash flow | Tiered pricing + payment plans available |

---

## Bottom Line

Every stakeholder interview confirmed the same core truth: **the Kelsey bottleneck is costing more than we originally estimated**.

| Original Estimate | Validated Reality | Impact |
|-------------------|-------------------|--------|
| Training: 5 hrs/wk | 20-30 hrs/wk × first 3-4 weeks (tapers after) | 4-6x higher during ramp |
| Training per tech | Undefined | 120-200 hours total ($21-35k billable) |
| Knowledge gaps: 10% | 30-35% | 3x higher |
| Morning coordination: Unmeasured | 1.5-2 hrs/day (4 of 5 days) | $10-15k/year |

### February 2026 Reality Check

If Kelsey hires 2 techs in February:
- **200 hours** of Kelsey's time in the first month alone
- **$35,000** in lost billable service revenue
- **$60,000** in opportunity cost

**The question isn't whether Phase 2 delivers ROI. It's how much ROI you want to capture.**
