## Slide 1: Title

**Freeing Kelsey to Build a $1.7M Business**
*(Without Breaking Himself)*

Arise Group AI
February 2026

*[Background: Arizona landscape, Pinetop vibes]*

---

## Slide 2: The Voice of Your Team

> *"I wish he would spend more time running the business instead of working in it... go out and make connections... that's what he's really good at."*
> — **Nikki**

> *"Everything goes in and out of Kelsey. It's a technical constraint beyond belief."*
> — **Megan**

*We interviewed everyone. They all said the same thing.*

---

## Slide 3: The Kelsey Bottleneck

**What's Really Going On:**

| Problem | Cost | Source |
|---------|------|--------|
| Training new techs | 20-30 hrs/wk × first 3-4 weeks = **$21K-$35K** per hire | Joe |
| 30% of calls need Kelsey | 2-3 daily interruptions | Joe |
| Morning coordination | 1.5-2 hours every day | Joe |
| Alyssa overwhelmed | 5-8 Kelsey calls/day | Alyssa |
| Data in 10 places | Constant context switching | Everyone |

*At $175/hr service rate, every hour Kelsey trains is an hour he can't bill.*
*February with 2 new techs = 200 hours = $35,000 in lost service revenue.*

---

## Slide 4: What Success Looks Like

> *"Saving him about 10 hours to do those higher leverage things would be like a success."*
> — **Nikki**

**The Pinetop Test:**
Can Kelsey take a week off while the business runs?

*[Visual: Coffee cup, balcony, laptop with dashboard]*

## Slide 5: The Solution — Clone Kelsey (Digitally)

**Three Things:**

1. **Unified Company Brain**
   - One place to ask any question
   - Voice-friendly (no clicking, no reading)
   - Connects Jobber, Ply, QuickBooks, Quo, email

2. **Clone Kelsey Training System**
   - 25-30 videos of actual repairs
   - Joe's preferred learning method
   - New techs onboard in weeks, not months

3. **Operations Cleanup**
   - Reduce 10-inbox email chaos
   - Automate morning coordination
   - Streamline Alyssa's workflow

---

## Slide 6: Why Voice-First Matters

> *"I can't learn on the fly with software I've never seen before. I can't even see the buttons on the screen."*
> — **Kelsey**

**Design Requirement:**
- No typing required
- Conversational interface
- Ask questions in plain English
- Get answers by voice

*Kelsey already uses voice texting while driving. We're building for how he actually works.*

---

## Slide 7: The Training Problem (Validated)

> *"Like 20, 30 hours... initially. It took me, like, a good three months."*
> — **Joe**

**The Pattern:** 20-30 hrs/week for first 3-4 weeks, then tapers off.

| Without System | With System |
|----------------|-------------|
| 120-200 hours per new tech | 30-50 hours |
| $21,000-$35,000 in lost billable time | $5,250-$8,750 |
| 3-month full ramp | 3-4 week ramp |

*Joe wants video tutorials he can review on his own time. We're building exactly what he asked for.*

---

## Slide 8: Investment Options

**All tiers include every value add. The difference is scope.**

| Tier | Investment | Annual ROI | Payback |
|------|------------|------------|---------|
| Foundation | $12,000 | $30K-$62K | 2-4 months |
| Growth | $22,000 | $71K-$137K | 2-3 months |
| Full Scale | $38,000 | $102K-$198K | 2-4 months |

**Payment Flexibility:**
- Standard: 50/50
- Extended: 3 payments over 3 months
- Upgrade Path: Start small, add scope as you see results

---

## Slide 9: ROI Math (Their Words, Our Numbers)

| Deliverable | Current Cost | With System | Savings | Source |
|-------------|--------------|-------------|---------|--------|
| Training/hire | $21K-$35K (@ $175/hr) | $5K-$9K | **$16K-$26K** | Joe |
| Knowledge gaps | 30% calls | 10% calls | $15K-$40K/yr | Joe |
| Morning chaos | 1.5-2 hrs/day | 30 min/day | $10K-$15K/yr | Joe |
| Kelsey freed | 0 hrs/wk | 10+ hrs/wk | **$150K-$195K/yr** | Nikki |

*Every number traces back to a direct quote from your team.*

---

## Slide 10: The Timeline

**4-6 Weeks to Transformation**

| Week | What Happens |
|------|--------------|
| Week 1 | Start filming with Joe, set up equipment database |
| Week 2-3 | Deploy knowledge base, first training videos |
| Week 4-5 | Mobile tools for Joe, full integrations |
| Week 6 | Team training, validate success metrics |

*Joe's ready to test. He's been asking for these tools.*

---

## Slide 11: Success Metrics

**The Nikki Test: "10 Hours Back"**

| Metric | Now | 30 Days | 90 Days |
|--------|-----|---------|---------|
| Training time/new tech | 20-30 hrs/wk (first month) | 10 hrs/wk | 5 hrs/wk |
| Joe help calls | 30% | 20% | 10% |
| Alyssa calls | 5-8/day | 2-3/day | 1-2/day |
| Morning coordination | 1.5-2 hrs | 1 hr | 30 min |
| **Kelsey freed** | **0 hrs/wk** | **5+ hrs** | **10+ hrs** |

---

## Slide 12: The Bottom Line

**What Your Team Told Us:**

| Person | What They Said |
|--------|----------------|
| Nikki | "10 hours for higher leverage things" |
| Nikki | "Pinetop dream — sipping coffee on the balcony" |
| Alyssa | "One thing after the other without any breaks" |
| Joe | "20-30 hrs/week initially... 3 months to ramp" |
| Megan | "Everything goes in and out of Kelsey" |
| Kelsey | "Can't learn on the fly with software" |

**The question isn't whether to do Phase 2.**
**It's how comprehensive you want the solution to be.**
