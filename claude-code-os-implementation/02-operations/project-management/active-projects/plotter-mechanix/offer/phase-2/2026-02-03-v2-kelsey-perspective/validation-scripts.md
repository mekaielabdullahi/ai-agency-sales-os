# Phase 2 Validation Follow-up Scripts
## Quick Calls to Confirm Proposal Numbers

**Created:** February 3, 2026
**Purpose:** Short validation calls before Kelsey interview

---

## Joe Follow-up Script (10-15 min)

**Goal:** Clarify training taper pattern to finalize hours-per-hire calculation

### Opening
> "Hey Joe, thanks for the great interview last week. We're putting together the final proposal for Kelsey and need to clarify a couple numbers from our conversation. This should only take 10 minutes."

### Questions

| # | Question | What We Need | Notes |
|---|----------|--------------|-------|
| 1 | "You mentioned the first 3-4 weeks were 20-30 hours of Kelsey's time per week. After that first month, what did it drop to? Like in your second month, how many hours a week was Kelsey still training you?" | Month 2 hours/week | Current assumption: 10-15 hrs/wk |
| 2 | "And then month 3 - was it even less by then?" | Month 3 hours/week | Current assumption: 5-10 hrs/wk |
| 3 | "When would you say it dropped to basically nothing - like less than an hour or two a week?" | Endpoint timing | He said "less than 10%" now |
| 4 | "If you had to guess, how many total hours do you think Kelsey spent training you over those 3 months? Like if you added it all up?" | Total hours estimate | Our calc: 120-200 hrs |

### Recording Table

```
Month 1 (weeks 1-4):  ___ hrs/week × 4 weeks = ___ hours
Month 2 (weeks 5-8):  ___ hrs/week × 4 weeks = ___ hours
Month 3 (weeks 9-12): ___ hrs/week × 4 weeks = ___ hours
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
TOTAL:                                        ___ hours

Joe's gut estimate of total: ___ hours
```

### Closing
> "Perfect, that's exactly what we needed. One last thing - you mentioned you prefer video tutorials over live training. If you had a library of Kelsey doing the top repairs, would you actually use it? Like how often do you think you'd pull it up?"

**Answer:** _______________

> "Thanks Joe, really appreciate it. We'll have some tools for you to test soon."

## Alyssa Follow-up Script (10 min)

**Goal:** Confirm call frequency and get hourly rate for ROI calculation

### Opening
> "Hey Alyssa, quick follow-up from our interview. Just need to confirm a couple numbers for the proposal - should only take 10 minutes."

### Questions

| # | Question | What We Need | Notes |
|---|----------|--------------|-------|
| 1 | "What's your hourly rate? We need it for the automation ROI calculation." | Hourly rate | Assumed $35/hr |
| 2 | "You mentioned Kelsey calls you 5-8 times a day. Is that still accurate? Has it gone up or down lately?" | Confirm call volume | She said 5-8/day |
| 3 | "And those calls are usually 5-10 minutes each, right?" | Confirm duration | She said 5-10 min |
| 4 | "How much time per week do you spend translating Shopify orders into Jobber? Like the paper/ink orders where you have to convert boxes to rolls?" | Shopify-Jobber time | Joe mentioned 15-20 min per order |
| 5 | "How many of those orders do you process in a typical week?" | Order volume | For Shopify fix ROI |

### Recording Table

```
Alyssa's hourly rate:        $___/hr
Kelsey calls per day:        ___ calls (confirmed / changed to ___)
Call duration:               ___ minutes average
Shopify-Jobber time/order:   ___ minutes
Orders per week:             ___ orders
Weekly Shopify-Jobber time:  ___ minutes = ___ hours
```

### Quick Math (Do After Call)
```
Kelsey call time:
___ calls/day × ___ min × 5 days = ___ min/week = ___ hrs/week
___ hrs/week × $___/hr = $___/week Alyssa time on Kelsey calls

Shopify-Jobber time:
___ orders × ___ min = ___ min/week = ___ hrs/week
___ hrs/week × $___/hr = $___/week on manual translation
```

### Closing
> "Thanks Alyssa. One more thing - if you had a system where Kelsey's updates automatically showed up without him having to call you, would that actually help? Or do you need the calls for other reasons?"

**Answer:** _______________

## Nikki Follow-up Script (10 min)

**Goal:** Get revenue baseline and confirm Kelsey's working hours

### Opening
> "Hey Nikki, quick follow-up. We're finalizing the Phase 2 proposal and need a couple baseline numbers to make sure our ROI calculations are accurate. Should only take 10 minutes."

### Questions

| # | Question | What We Need | Notes |
|---|----------|--------------|-------|

| 3 | "How many hours a week does Kelsey actually work? Like from when he starts to when he's done for the day, including weekends?" | Weekly hours | We assumed 50 hrs |
| 4 | "You mentioned 10 hours freed would be success. Is that still the bar? Or has that changed?" | Success metric | She said 10 hrs/week |
| 5 | "Is Kelsey still planning to hire 1-2 more techs this year?" | Hiring plans | Affects training ROI |

### Recording Table

Hiring plans:           ___ techs this year
```

### Quick Math (Do After Call)
```
Kelsey's effective hourly rate:
$___ revenue ÷ 52 weeks ÷ ___ hrs/week = $___/hr

Training ROI (if hiring ___ techs):
___ techs × ___ hrs/tech × $175/hr = $___ training cost without system
```

### Closing
> "Thanks Nikki. Last question - you mentioned the 'Pinetop dream.' Is that still the goal? Like what would need to be true for Kelsey to actually take a week off up there?"

**Answer:** _______________

## Post-Calls: Update These Numbers

After completing all three calls, update `roi-calculations.md` with:

### Training System ROI
```
BEFORE (assumption):
- Month 1: 25 hrs/wk × 4 = 100 hrs
- Month 2: 12.5 hrs/wk × 4 = 50 hrs
- Month 3: 7.5 hrs/wk × 4 = 30 hrs
- Total: 180 hrs

AFTER (validated):
- Month 1: ___ hrs/wk × 4 = ___ hrs
- Month 2: ___ hrs/wk × 4 = ___ hrs
- Month 3: ___ hrs/wk × 4 = ___ hrs
- Total: ___ hrs

Cost per hire: ___ hrs × $175/hr = $___
With 2-3 hires/year: $___ - $___
```

### Alyssa Time Recovery ROI
```
BEFORE (assumption):
- 6.5 calls/day × 7.5 min × 5 days = 244 min = 4 hrs/week
- 4 hrs × $35/hr = $140/week = $7,280/year

AFTER (validated):
- ___ calls/day × ___ min × 5 days = ___ min = ___ hrs/week
- ___ hrs × $___ /hr = $___/week = $___/year
```

### Kelsey Opportunity Cost
```
BEFORE (assumption):
- Revenue: $1.4M (midpoint of range)
- Hours: 50/week × 52 = 2,600/year
- Rate: $1.4M ÷ 2,600 = $538/hr gross → $350/hr net (65%)

AFTER (validated):
- Revenue: $___
- Hours: ___/week × 52 = ___/year
- Rate: $___ ÷ ___ = $___/hr gross → $___/hr net
```

## Red Flags to Watch For

| If They Say | It Means | Adjust |
|-------------|----------|--------|
| Joe: "Training was more like 10 hrs/week" | Our 20-30 estimate too high | Lower training ROI |
| Alyssa: "Kelsey only calls 2-3 times/day now" | Things improved since interview | Lower Alyssa ROI |
| Nikki: "Revenue was $800k" | Our $1.2M-$1.7M way off | Recalculate all opportunity costs |
| Nikki: "Kelsey works 70 hrs/week" | He's even more overloaded | Strengthen burnout argument |
| Anyone: "Things have changed a lot" | Need fresh data | Consider re-interviewing |
