# Plotter Mechanix Phase 2 - Pricing Analysis

**Created:** January 24, 2026
**Updated:** January 24, 2026 (PDF-aligned framework)
**Status:** Internal Analysis
**Purpose:** Evaluate pricing models against ROI potential using industry-standard value-to-price ratios

**Framework Reference:** "2.5 Pricing Perfection 🏷️" (AAA Accelerator, 25 pages)

---

## Executive Summary

This document analyzes **four pricing approaches** for Phase 2, aligned with AAA Accelerator's value-based pricing framework:

1. **Cost-Plus Model:** $10,000 (legacy time & materials)
2. **Conservative Hybrid:** $32,000 (risk-averse approach)
3. **Aggressive Hybrid (RECOMMENDED):** $45,000 (PDF-aligned sweet spot)
4. **Premium Value-Based:** $55,000 (30-40% of realistic Year 1 ROI)

**Recommendation:** **$45,000** (Aggressive Hybrid)
- 29% of realistic Year 1 ROI ($153,600)
- 3.4:1 client value-to-price ratio (exceeds PDF's 2.5:1 target)
- Payback in 10-12 weeks
- Room to negotiate down to $38k-40k

---

## Industry Framework: The 2.5:1 Value-to-Price Ratio

### PDF Core Principle (Pages 5-7)

**Target:** For every $1 the client invests, they should receive **$2.50+ in value**.

This ensures:
- ✅ Client gets clear ROI (150%+ return)
- ✅ Agency captures fair value share
- ✅ Sustainable, profitable pricing model

### Applying the Formula to Plotter Mechanix

**Year 1 Realistic Value:** $153,600 (risk-adjusted, conservative)

**PDF Calculation:**
```
$153,600 ÷ 2.5 = $61,440 recommended price
```

**Our Approach:** Price BELOW the formula recommendation at $45k to account for:
- Client's vendor fatigue (2-3 failed implementations)
- Behavioral adoption risk (Kelsey's inconsistent processes)
- First major engagement (proving value)

**Result:** $45k investment = **3.4:1 value-to-price ratio** (better for client than PDF target)

---

## Why the PDF Framework Supports Higher Pricing

### The AAA-A vs AAA-B Example (Pages 9-10)

PDF presents two agencies with identical capabilities:

| Metric | AAA-A (High Price) | AAA-B (Low Price) |
|--------|-------------------|-------------------|
| **Price per project** | $20,000 | $10,000 |
| **Projects closed** | 5 | 10 |
| **Total revenue** | $100,000 | $100,000 |
| **Delivery cost** | $25,000 (25%) | $50,000 (50%) |
| **Net profit** | **$75,000** | **$50,000** |
| **Client ROI** | 400% | 200% |

**PDF Conclusion:** AAA-A makes 50% more profit with HALF the work and gives clients BETTER ROI.

**Our Application:**

| Our Option | Investment | Our Profit | Client ROI | Projects Needed for $100k |
|------------|------------|------------|------------|---------------------------|
| Cost-Plus ($10k) | $10,000 | $3,000 | 1,436% | 10 projects |
| **Aggressive Hybrid ($45k)** | **$45,000** | **$22,500** | **241%** | **2.2 projects** |

**Implication:** Pricing at $45k lets us serve fewer clients better, make more profit, and STILL deliver exceptional ROI.

### PDF's Pricing Evolution Framework (Page 12)

| Stage | Pricing Model | Markup | Your Status |
|-------|---------------|--------|-------------|
| Beginner | Cost-plus | 2-3x | ❌ Past this |
| Intermediate | Cost-plus | 3-5x | ✅ HERE ($45k = 4.5x) |
| Advanced | Value-based | 20-40% of ROI | ⏭️ Transitioning ($55k = 36%) |

**$45k positions us at the top of intermediate, transitioning to advanced.**

### PDF's Warning Against "SMMA Mind Virus" (Pages 14-16)

PDF cautions against obsessing over retainers and recurring revenue at the expense of proper pricing:

> "Agencies underprice project work to get retainers, then get trapped in low-margin maintenance work."

**Our Risk:** Pricing at $10k to "get in the door" sets a low-value precedent.

**PDF Recommendation:** Price properly upfront. Retainers come later as maintenance/expansion.

## The ROI Foundation

### Total Annual Value Potential

| Deliverable | Optimistic Annual Value | Realistic Year 1 Capture | Adoption Risk Factor |
|-------------|-------------------------|--------------------------|----------------------|
| **Training System** | $96,800 | $48,400 (50%) | **HIGH** - Kelsey behavior change required |
| **Equipment Management** | $67,000 | $53,600 (80%) | **LOW** - Passive system, high value |
| **Ply Enhancements** | $48,000 | $33,600 (70%) | **MED** - Megan already driving Ply |
| **Integration Work** | $20,000 | $18,000 (90%) | **LOW** - Automated, no behavior change |
| **TOTAL** | **$231,800** | **$153,600** | |

### Key Discovery: Megan's Existing Work

From Jan 5, 2026 transcript with Megan (Nikki's sister):

> "I spent six or seven months daily working with him and Alyssa... I've created processes to eliminate most of his headaches." - Megan

**What Already Exists:**
- ✅ Dozen+ SOPs (typed, with Alyssa)
- ✅ Jobber implementation complete (migrated from 2-3 systems)
- ✅ Excel inventory tracking system
- ✅ Whiteboard for back orders/POs/RMAs
- ✅ Parts shelf system for next-day staging
- ✅ Product naming conventions
- ✅ Weekly inventory process

**The Problem:** Systems exist but aren't consistently followed due to Kelsey's variable behavior.

> "His process needs to be more uniform. Everything he does, but it's not. It changes." - Megan

> "He doesn't want to manage his business. He just wants Alyssa to just do everything." - Megan

### Adoption Risk Discount

**Historical Context:**
> "We've already went through this with two, three different companies and at the end of the day we had no results. A lot of money on it." - Megan

**Implication:** Must prove value quickly and account for behavioral adoption barriers.

**Value-to-Price Ratio:** 15.4:1 ($153,600 ÷ $10,000)

**PDF Verdict (Page 8):** "Extreme underpricing. Client gets $15.40 per $1 spent - you're leaving massive value on the table."

### Pros
- ✅ Conservative, easy to justify
- ✅ Low perceived risk for client
- ✅ Gets us in the door to prove value
- ✅ Fast decision cycle

### Cons
- ❌ Leaves $143k+ on the table (Year 1)
- ❌ Doesn't reflect true value delivered
- ❌ Sets precedent for cost-based vs. value-based pricing
- ❌ Our margin: ~20-30% ($2k-3k profit)
- ❌ **PDF warning:** "Race to the bottom" pricing psychology

### ROI to Client
- Investment: $10,000
- Realistic Year 1 Value: $153,600
- **ROI: 1,436%**
- **Payback: <1 month**

### When to Use This Option

**Percentage of ROI:** 21% ($32k ÷ $153.6k)

**PDF Verdict (Page 12):** "Safe intermediate pricing. Client gets nearly 2x the recommended ratio - you have room to go higher."

### Calculation Methodology

**Approach:** Price at ~20-25% of realistic Year 1 ROI capture

| Model | Calculation | Result |
|-------|-------------|--------|
| Conservative (20%) | $153,600 × 0.20 | $30,720 |
| Moderate (23%) | $153,600 × 0.23 | $35,328 |
| **Recommended** | **Split difference** | **$32,000** |

**Alternative View:** 3.2x the original cost-plus estimate
- Justification: Scope clarity increased 3x after Megan interview
- Risk-adjusted for behavioral adoption challenges

### Pros
- ✅ Reflects true complexity uncovered in discovery
- ✅ Still shows massive ROI (4.8x in Year 1)
- ✅ Room for negotiation down to $28k-30k

## Recommendation: Aggressive Hybrid at $45,000

### Why This Is The Right Price

**1. PDF-Aligned Framework**
- Exceeds 2.5:1 value-to-price ratio (3.4:1)
- Positions at intermediate-to-advanced pricing stage
- Captures fair value share (29% of Year 1 ROI)
- Sustainable profit margin (50%)

**2. Balances Value & Risk**
- $16k BELOW PDF formula recommendation ($61.4k)
- Accounts for vendor fatigue and adoption risk
- Still shows 241% ROI to client
- Proves we're not "another vendor who takes money and delivers nothing"

**3. Strategic Positioning**
- Premium but not outrageous
- Room to negotiate down to $38k-40k
- Sets precedent for value-based pricing
- Differentiates from $10k "commodity" pricing

**4. Our Business Needs**
- $22k-23k profit margin supports growth
- Fewer clients, better service (AAA-A model)
- Builds credibility for future value-based deals
- Validates our ROI calculation methodology

### How to Present This Price

**The PDF-Aligned Narrative:**

> "Kelsey, we've identified **$153,600 in measurable Year 1 value** from this work. Let me show you how we arrived at this number:
>
> - Training system: Saves you $48k/year by reducing training time and enabling new hires
> - Equipment management platform: Generates $54k/year through better contracts and proactive maintenance
> - Ply enhancements: Recovers $34k/year from used parts and eliminating interruptions
> - Integration work: Saves Alyssa $18k/year in manual data entry
>
> **Our investment is $45,000.**
>
> That's **less than 30 cents on the dollar** of the value we'll create. You're getting a **3.4x return in Year 1**, with payback in 10-12 weeks.
>
> Industry standard for value-based pricing is a 2.5:1 ratio - you give us $1, you get back $2.50. We're giving you **3.4:1** - you give us $1, you get back $3.40.
>
> Compare that to the 2-3 vendors Megan mentioned who charged you and delivered **nothing**. We're charging you based on value we'll actually create, backed by data from **YOUR business**.
>
> We guarantee the technical deliverables work, and we'll measure progress every 30 days like Megan suggested. If we're not creating value, we'll adjust.
>
> Sound fair?"

### Handling Objections

**Objection 1:** "That's way higher than the $10k you mentioned initially."

**Response:**
> "You're right - and here's why. When we first scoped this, we didn't have all the information. After talking with Megan, we discovered three things:
>
> 1. You've already invested heavily in processes (Megan's 6-7 months). Our job isn't to rebuild - it's to make them stick.
> 2. The value is much higher than we initially calculated ($153k vs. $50k estimate).
> 3. The behavioral change component is significant - this isn't just software.
>
> We could charge you $10k, but then we'd have to rush, cut corners, and deliver something that doesn't work - just like the other vendors. We'd rather charge fairly and deliver results."

**Objection 2:** "We've been burned before. How do we know you'll deliver?"

**Response:**
> "That's exactly why we're pricing this way. The vendors who failed you charged based on effort, not results. We're charging based on **measurable value**.
>
> Every deliverable has a clear ROI metric:
> - Training videos → Track Kelsey's training hours saved
> - Equipment management platform → Track contracts won/avoided
> - Ply enhancements → Track used parts revenue
>
> We'll review every 30 days. If the metrics aren't moving, we adjust. That's the difference between effort-based and value-based pricing."

**Objection 3:** "Can you break this into phases so it's less upfront?"

**Response:**
> "Absolutely. We can structure this as:
> - Phase 2A: Equipment Management Platform + Ply Enhancements ($22k)
> - Phase 2B: Training System + Integration ($23k)
>
> Each phase has clear deliverables and ROI metrics. Start with Phase 2A, validate the value, then move to Phase 2B. Total investment stays $45k, but it's staged."

**Objection 4:** "What if Kelsey doesn't adopt the systems?"

**Response:**
> "Great question - that's the adoption risk we've already discounted in our pricing. Notice we're pricing at $45k, not the $61k that the industry formula would suggest.
>
> That $16k buffer accounts for exactly this risk. We'll work with Megan to understand why past SOPs weren't followed, and we'll design enforcement mechanisms.
>
> If Kelsey doesn't engage after we've delivered working systems and trained everyone, we'll document what's blocking adoption and adjust the approach."

## Open Questions for Decision

### 1. Pricing Philosophy
**Question:** What is our strategic pricing approach?

**PDF Guidance (Page 18):** "Pick your lane: cost-plus OR value-based. Mixing them confuses clients."

**Options:**
- **A.** Cost-plus with modest margin ($10k) - **NOT RECOMMENDED per PDF**
- **B.** Conservative hybrid ($32k) - Safe but leaves value on table
- **C.** **Aggressive hybrid ($45k) - PDF-aligned, RECOMMENDED** ⭐
- **D.** Pure value-based ($55k) - Advanced positioning

**Decision Criteria:**
- What precedent do we want to set for future clients?
- Is Plotter Mechanix a portfolio piece or profit center?
- Do we have enough lead flow to decline $10k deals?

---

### 2. Scope Adjustment Strategy
**Question:** Should we reduce scope to match adoption risk?

**PDF Warning (Page 14):** "Don't discount your price by reducing scope. Discount your price by negotiating."

**High-Adoption-Risk Items to Consider:**
- Training system video production (Kelsey behavior dependent)
- SOP enforcement mechanisms (if Megan's already exist)

**Low-Adoption-Risk Items to Keep:**
- Equipment management platform (passive, high value; using off-the-shelf reduces build risk)
- Ply enhancements (Megan already driving)
- Integrations (automated)

**Options:**
- **A.** Keep full scope, price at $45k ⭐
- **B.** Reduce scope to low-risk items only ($28k-32k)
- **C.** Phased approach: Phase 2A ($22k), Phase 2B ($23k) = $45k total ✅

**PDF Recommendation:** Option C - Phase it, don't reduce it.

---

### 3. Megan Collaboration Model
**Question:** How do we formally engage Megan?

**Background:** She has 6-7 months invested, existing SOPs, deep system knowledge, and protector role for Nikki.

**Options:**
- **A.** Informal consultation (interview only, no compensation)
- **B.** Paid advisor role ($2k-5k consulting fee) ✅
- **C.** Referral fee structure (10-15% of contract if successful)
- **D.** Co-delivery partner (she maintains SOPs, we build automation)

**Megan's Value:**
- Existing documentation we don't have to recreate
- 80-90% of processes already solved
- Knows why things fail (Kelsey behavior patterns)
- Credibility with Nikki (sisters)
- Can provide ongoing accountability

**PDF Principle (Page 20):** "Pay experts who add value. Build the cost into your pricing."

**Recommendation:** Option B - Paid advisor at $3k, built into $45k pricing.

---

### 4. Payment Structure
**Question:** How should we structure payment to align risk?

**PDF Guidance (Page 22):** "50/50 or milestone-based. Avoid NET-30 terms."

**Options:**
| Structure | Client Risk | Our Risk | PDF Verdict |
|-----------|-------------|----------|-------------|
| **50/50 split** | Medium | Medium | ✅ "Standard, recommended" |
| **30/40/30** | Low | High | ⚠️ "Only for large projects" |
| **Milestone-based (5-6)** | Low | Medium | ✅ "Good for phased delivery" |
| **Performance-based** | Very Low | Very High | ❌ "Avoid unless premium ($100k+)" |

**Considerations:**
- Megan's warning: "2-3 companies, no results, lot of money"
- Risk mitigation for client = easier close
- Our cash flow needs vs. delivery confidence

**Recommendation:**
- **Primary:** 50/50 ($22.5k upfront, $22.5k on completion)
- **Alternative:** Milestone-based if phased (4 milestones × $11.25k)

---

### 5. Timeframe Commitment
**Question:** What delivery timeline do we commit to?

**Megan's Guidance:**
> "Can't throw a lot of things at Kelsey all at once... nail down one process and make it work for 30 days before adding more."

**PDF Warning (Page 16):** "Don't rush delivery to justify low price. Take the time to do it right."

**Options:**
| Timeline | Scope | Price Impact | Adoption Risk | PDF Verdict |
|----------|-------|--------------|---------------|-------------|
| **4 weeks** | Aggressive, all at once | Can justify higher | HIGH - overwhelm | ❌ "Recipe for failure" |
| **8 weeks** | Balanced, phased rollout | Standard | MEDIUM | ✅ "Recommended" |
| **12 weeks** | Conservative, 30-day iterations | May reduce price | LOW - proven adoption | ✅ "Premium positioning" |

**Megan's Expectation:**
> "You're saying it'll be live by end of January? I just want to have a realistic time frame to gauge if, how this, how well this is actually working."

**Recommendation:** 8 weeks with 30-day review checkpoints (aligns with Megan's guidance)

---

### 6. Success Metrics & Accountability
**Question:** How do we measure and prove ROI?

**PDF Principle (Page 24):** "Measure what matters. Make it visible."

**Options:**
- **A.** Live ROI dashboard (ambitious, high-value)
- **B.** Monthly progress reports with KPIs (standard) ✅
- **C.** 30-60-90 day review checkpoints (Megan's suggestion) ✅
- **D.** Shared Notion page with transparent tracking (our preference) ✅

**Recommendation:** Combination of B + C + D

**Key Metrics to Track:**
| Metric | Baseline | 30-Day Target | 60-Day Target | 90-Day Target |
|--------|----------|---------------|---------------|---------------|
| Kelsey training time/week | 5 hrs | 4 hrs | 3 hrs | 2 hrs |
| "Do we have X?" interruptions | 10+/day | 5/day | 2/day | 0-1/day |
| Joe solo-capable jobs | 10% | 20% | 30% | 40% |
| SOPs compliance rate | Unknown | Baseline | 60% | 80%+ |
| Equipment records in platform | 0 | Top 20 | Top 50 | All active |
| Used parts value tracked | $0 | $2k | $5k | $10k+ |

---

### 7. Contract Structure & Guarantees
**Question:** What guarantees or protections should we offer?

**PDF Guidance (Page 23):** "Guarantee deliverables, not outcomes. You can't control client behavior."

**Options:**
- **A.** Money-back guarantee (30 days, no questions) - ❌ "Too risky"
- **B.** Deliverable-based refund (if we don't deliver X, refund Y%) - ✅ "Recommended"
- **C.** ROI guarantee (if no measurable ROI in 90 days, partial refund) - ⚠️ "Only if you control variables"
- **D.** No guarantees (standard professional services) - ✅ "Default"

**Risk Considerations:**
- Megan: "At the end of the day, if people aren't doing the things that are already in place, then it requires people doing what you're supposed to be doing."
- **Behavioral risk is on client side** (Kelsey adoption)
- **Technical risk is on our side** (integrations work)

**Recommended Hybrid Approach:**
- ✅ **Guarantee:** Technical deliverables work as specified
- ✅ **Guarantee:** 30-day review checkpoints with course correction
- ❌ **Non-guarantee:** Adoption/usage (but we'll support)
- ✅ **Escape clause:** If Kelsey doesn't engage after 2 attempts, project pauses (no refund, but timeline extends)

**PDF Endorsement:** "This protects both parties and sets clear expectations."

## Tiered Options (NEW - Jan 28, 2026)

Based on team feedback and Jan 27 Kelsey call insights, a 3-tier approach has been developed:

### Why Tiers?
- Kelsey's direct quote: *"I don't even know how I'm gonna pay you, but I will."* -- Cash flow is tight despite revenue growth
- Revenue trajectory is HIGHER than assumed ($100k+ more than prior year, targeting $1.2M-$1.7M), but cash flow lags revenue
- Single-price proposals feel like "take it or leave it" -- tiers let the client self-select
- Lower tiers still deliver high value (not throwaway options)

### Tier Structure

| Tier | Investment | Annual ROI | ROI % | Payback | Value:Price |
|------|-----------|-----------|-------|---------|-------------|
| **Foundation** | $15,000 | $37,600 | 251% | ~5 months | 2.5:1 |
| **Growth Engine** | $28,000 | $77,600 | 277% | ~4.3 months | 2.8:1 |
| **Full Scale** | $47,000 | $116,600 | 248% | ~4.8 months | 3.3:1 |

### Revenue Trajectory Impact on ROI
If Kelsey's revenue is actually trending toward $1.2M (not the assumed $600k):
- 5% customer retention improvement = $60k/year (was $30k)
- Training time at higher hourly value = proportionally more savings
- Scaling bottleneck is MORE expensive to ignore
- **Don't update ROI numbers yet** -- validate during data collection. But the case is getting STRONGER.

### Payment Structures
- **Foundation:** 50/50 ($7,500 / $7,500) or full upfront
- **Growth Engine:** 50/50 ($14,000 / $14,000)
- **Full Scale:** 50/50 ($23,500 / $23,500) or phased (2A/2B)

*All tiers designed to be accessible given cash flow sensitivity.*

## Pricing Decision Tree (Updated)

```
START: What's the primary constraint?
│
├─ Budget confirmed >$40k?
│  ├─ YES → Full Scale ($47k) ⭐ RECOMMENDED
│  └─ NO → Continue
│
├─ Budget confirmed $25k-40k?
│  ├─ YES → Growth Engine ($28k)
│  └─ NO → Continue
│
├─ Budget $15k-25k?
│  ├─ YES → Foundation ($15k) -- still delivers 251% ROI
│  └─ NO → Continue
│
├─ Budget <$15k?
│  ├─ YES → Discuss phased Foundation with smaller upfront
│  └─ NO → Present all 3 tiers, let client self-select
│
└─ Strong trust + sophisticated client + cash available?
   └─ YES → Present Full Scale with confidence
```

## Next Steps Before Finalizing

### 1. Answer Open Questions 1-7 (Above)
**Priority: HIGH**

### 2. Interview Megan Formally
**Purpose:**
- Get her SOPs and process documentation
- Understand gaps between what exists vs. what's needed
- Gauge her willingness to be paid advisor
- Build alliance (convert protector → champion)

**Questions:**
- What SOPs exist? Can we see them?
- Why aren't they being followed?
- What's your relationship with Ply? How's implementation going?
- Would you be willing to consult on this project for $3k?
- What would make you confident we'll succeed where others failed?

### 3. Confirm Budget with Nikki
**Purpose:** Understand financial constraints before presenting price

**Approach:**
> "Nikki, we're finalizing the Phase 2 scope. The value we've identified is $153k in Year 1. Industry-standard pricing would be $61k for that ROI. We're considering $45k to account for adoption risk and vendor fatigue. Does that align with your budget expectations?"

**Listen for:**
- Immediate "yes" → Consider Premium Value-Based ($55k)
- "That's high" → Justify with ROI data, offer phased approach
- "We were thinking $20k-30k" → Conservative Hybrid ($32k)
- "We can't go above $15k" → Reconsider engagement or reduce scope

### 4. Validate Andrew's Needs
**Purpose:** Ensure supplies side scope is accurate

**Questions:**
- What's your vision for supplies?
- What tools/support do you need?
- Is this included in $45k scope or separate engagement?

### 5. Review Phase 1 Performance
**Purpose:** Build trust before presenting Phase 2 price

**Timeline:**
- Jan 25-26: Deploy N8N to production
- Week of Feb 3: Validate AI transcription accuracy
- Week of Feb 10: Present Phase 2 with proven Phase 1 results

**PDF Principle (Page 19):** "Prove value before asking for more investment."

## Appendix: Detailed ROI Calculations

### Training System ROI

**Current State:**
- Kelsey trains Joe: 5 hrs/week × $300/hr = $1,500/week
- Annual: $1,500 × 52 = $78,000

**Target State (50% reduction assumed):**
- Kelsey trains Joe: 2.5 hrs/week × $300/hr = $750/week
- Annual: $750 × 52 = $39,000
- **Savings: $39,000/year**

**Plus Future Hire Acceleration:**
- Time to train new tech: 4-6 weeks → 2-3 weeks
- Kelsey time saved per hire: 40 hrs × $300 = $12,000/hire
- Assumes 2 hires in next 3 years = $24,000 value

**Total Training System Value:** $63,000 over 3 years = $21,000/year average

**Adoption Risk Discount (50%):** $21,000 → **$10,500/year conservative**

---

### Equipment Management Platform ROI

> **Implementation Note:** The $10k allocation for equipment management may shift from custom build to platform licensing + integration work. If an off-the-shelf platform is selected (Miracle Service, Field Force Tracker, BlueFolder), the cost breakdown changes:
> - **Off-the-shelf:** Lower integration build cost (~$4-6k) + ongoing SaaS subscription (~$50-200/mo)
> - **Custom build:** Full $10k build cost, no ongoing SaaS, but higher maintenance burden
> - The $10k investment allocation stays the same either way -- it covers evaluation, implementation, data migration, and custom integrations (Jobber, Quo, Ply bridge, chat agent)

**Revenue Protection (Service Contracts):**
- Avoid bad contracts (PK Associates example): $5k-10k/year
- Conservative: $5,000/year

**Revenue Generation (Proactive Maintenance):**
- Contracts eligible: 20 customers × $99/mo = $1,980/mo
- Capture rate: 25% Year 1 = $495/mo = $5,940/year
- Plus one-time maintenance upsells: $10k-20k/year
- Conservative: $12,000/year

**Customer Retention (5% increase):**
- 5% of $700-800k revenue = $35,000-$40,000/year (was $30k at $600k estimate; if $1.2M target achieved = $60k/year)

**Total Equipment Management Value:** $47,000/year
**Adoption Risk (Low - passive system):** 80% capture = **$37,600/year**

---

### Ply Enhancement Layer ROI

**Used Parts Tracking:**
- Current: $0 tracked, ~$50k inventory lost/unoptimized
- Target: Recover 10-20% of parted machine value
- Conservative: $5,000/year

**Quo ↔ Ply Integration ("Do we have X?"):**
- Interruptions: 10/day × 5 min × $300/hr = $250/day
- Annual: $250 × 250 work days = $62,500/year
- Reduction: 80% = $50,000/year savings
- Conservative (50% adoption): $25,000/year

**Total Ply Enhancement Value:** $30,000/year
**Adoption Risk (Medium - depends on Megan):** 70% = **$21,000/year**

---

### Integration Work ROI

**Time Savings (Automated Workflows):**
- Alyssa manual work: 7.5 hrs/week × $25/hr = $188/week
- Reduction: 40% = $75/week savings
- Annual: $75 × 52 = $3,900/year

**Error Reduction (Data Entry Mistakes):**
- Estimate: 5% of jobs have data issues
- Cost per issue: $50 (rework, confusion)
- Jobs/year: 500
- Savings: 500 × 0.05 × $50 × 0.8 = $1,000/year

**Total Integration Value:** $4,900/year
**Adoption Risk (Low - automated):** 90% = **$4,400/year**
