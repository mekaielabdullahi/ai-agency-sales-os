# Plotter Mechanix Phase 2 Proposal
## Building Infrastructure That Scales to 10x
### Now With Validated Data from Your Team

**Presented by:** Arise Group AI
**Date:** January 31, 2026
**Investment:** $15,000 - $47,000 (3 tier options)
**Timeline:** 4-6 weeks
**Expected ROI:** $85,000 - $185,000/year (validated with Joe's input)

---

## Executive Summary

Phase 1 proved we deliver -- Quo-Jobber integration is deployed and Kelsey chose Quo as his default phone. Now Phase 2 addresses the validated bottlenecks preventing scale.

**What Joe's interview revealed:**
- Training new techs takes **20-30 hours per week for 3 months** (not the 5 hrs/week we estimated)
- **20% of service calls** still require Kelsey's help (another 10-15% need minor guidance)
- The Shopify-Jobber integration is broken -- **2-3 under-deliveries monthly** due to unit mismatch
- Morning coordination takes **1.5-2 hours daily** and routes change 4 out of 5 days
- You're leaving money on the table with CAD pricing ($1.75 vs FedEx $4.75) and declining print services

**The Core Question:** If you were 10x your size tomorrow, what breaks?

**Joe's Answer:** Everything that requires Kelsey's personal involvement:
1. **Training bottleneck** - Can't scale when training takes 20-30 hrs/week per tech
2. **Knowledge in Kelsey's head** - 20-35% of calls need his expertise
3. **Manual data fixes** - Shopify-Jobber mismatch costs 6 hours/month minimum
4. **Morning chaos** - 1.5-2 hours daily just coordinating who goes where
5. **Equipment tracking** - Jobber missing customer equipment lists

## Joe's Validated Pain Points → Our Solutions

### Problem 1: Training Takes 20-30 Hours/Week (Not 5)
**Joe's Reality:**
- Kelsey spent 20-30 hrs/week for first 3 months training Joe
- Now down to <10% of Kelsey's time (successful ramp)
- Joe prefers video tutorials over live training (can review, better retention)
- A new tech needs 8 hours just to learn office equipment

**Our Solution: Training System**
- Chris films Kelsey during actual service calls
- Joe's top requested videos:
  1. Technical parts replacements
  2. Diagnostics flowcharts
  3. Post-repair procedures
  4. Service mode operations
  5. Non-HP equipment handling
- New techs onboard in 1-2 weeks vs 3 months

**Validated ROI:** $30,000 - $60,000/year in saved training time

---

### Problem 2: Shopify-Jobber Data Mismatch
**Joe's Reality:**
- Shopify tracks paper by box (2 rolls per box)
- Jobber tracks by individual roll

- Each fix takes 2 hours of coordination

**Our Solution: Automated Unit Conversion**
- Build Shopify→Jobber automation with proper unit mapping

### Problem 3: Knowledge Base Gap
**Joe's Reality:**
- Calls Kelsey for help on 20% of jobs
- Needs minor guidance on another 10-15%
- Most frustrating: Solvent printers, Epson, UV curable, ink assemblies
- Wants mobile access to procedures in the field

**Our Solution: Multi-Channel Knowledge Base**
- Chat agent with RAG (Joe's specific request)
- Mobile-friendly troubleshooting guides
- Video tutorials for complex procedures

## Discovered Opportunities (Phase 3 Potential)

### From Joe's Interview:
1. **CAD Pricing Gap**
   - Current: $1.50-1.75/page
   - FedEx: $4.75/page
   - No setup fees despite 30 min - 3 hr prep time
   - **Opportunity:** Add setup fees, raise prices

2. **Print Services Revenue**
   - Non-competitors asking for print services (tint shops, CAD offices)
   - Currently declining to avoid upsetting print shop clients
   - **Opportunity:** New revenue stream

3. **Quality Optimization**
   - Joe discovered "Medium Quality" = "High Quality" visually

## Why This Investment Makes Sense Now

### Joe's Validation Changed Everything
- Training burden is **4-6x higher** than we estimated
- Knowledge gaps affect **30-35%** of service calls (not 10%)
- The Shopify-Jobber issue is **costing you monthly**
- Morning chaos is **measurable and fixable**

### The Math (Using Joe's Numbers)
**Training one new tech without system:**
- 20-30 hrs/week × 12 weeks = 240-360 hours
- At $50/hr opportunity cost = $12,000 - $18,000
- That's 25-38% of the Full Scale investment for ONE hire

**With our system:**
- Self-paced videos Joe requested
- 60-90% reduction in Kelsey's involvement
- ROI on first hire alone

### Risk Mitigation
- Joe validated every assumption with real experience
- Shopify-Jobber fix is immediate value (Week 1)
- Knowledge base directly addresses Joe's daily struggles
- Phased deployment means quick wins early

## Next Steps

1. **Choose Your Investment Tier**
   - Foundation ($15k): Core fixes, immediate ROI
   - Growth ($28k): Add intelligence layer
   - Full Scale ($47k): Complete transformation

2. **Approve Week 1 Quick Wins**
   - Shopify-Jobber fix (immediate)
   - Remaining interviews (Megan, Andrew, Alyssa)
   - Equipment platform evaluation

3. **Payment Terms**
   - 50% deposit to begin
   - 50% on completion
   - Phase 2A/2B split available

4. **Set Kickoff Date**
   - Week of February 3, 2026 recommended
   - Chris ready to film with Joe
   - Fix under-delivery issue immediately

---

## The Bottom Line

Joe validated what we suspected but couldn't prove:
- Your training burden is **massive** (20-30 hrs/week, not 5)
- Knowledge gaps affect **1 in 3 service calls**
- The Shopify-Jobber issue is **costing you today**
- Morning coordination is **eating 10 hours per week**

Every tier pays for itself in year one. The Full Scale option could pay for itself with just 2-3 new tech hires.

**The question isn't whether to do Phase 2. It's how comprehensive you want the solution to be.**
