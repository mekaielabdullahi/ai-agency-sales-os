## NEW SLIDE: Phase 1 Is Working

**Headline:** "The Inbound Is Amazing"

> *"The inbound stuff is working amazing, bro. I'm starting to trust it. When I take a call, by the time I get off the phone, within seconds, it's like 'you have an opportunity, a new request' and Alyssa gets it."*
> — **Kelsey, Feb 9, 2026**

**What's Working:**
- Calls auto-sync to Jobber Requests ✅
- Alyssa gets notifications in seconds ✅
- Kelsey "starting to trust it" ✅

**Phase 1 ROI:** $5K investment → $73K annual value = **1,378% ROI**

## UPDATED SLIDE: The Real Numbers (Validated)

**Headline:** "Every Hour Lost = $75"

| Metric | Value | Source |
|--------|-------|--------|
| Kelsey's hourly rate | **$75/hr** | Direct quote |
| Phone interruptions during service calls | 1-2 calls per job | Direct observation |
| Time lost per interruption | 10-15 min | Direct quote |
| Service calls per day | 5+ | Estimated |
| **Weekly time lost to interruptions** | **12.5 hours** | Calculated |
| **Annual cost of interruptions** | **$48,750** | 12.5 × $75 × 52 |

**Quote:**
> *"People say you're paid more than my attorney. I say, yeah, but I'll be done in 2 hours. Your attorney will take 6 months."*

## UPDATED SLIDE: The Quo Feedback Loop

**Headline:** What Needs Fixing (We're Listening)

| Issue Kelsey Raised | Our Response |
|---------------------|--------------|
| Default phone reverts to FaceTime | Fix in Phase 2: iOS shortcut |
| Follow-up calls bury in same opportunity | Fix in Phase 2: Multi-job detection |
| 15,000 contacts are messy/outdated | Phase 2 deliverable: Contact cleanup workflow |
| Can't find where calls were made from | Fix: Call log dashboard |

**Key Insight:**
> *"The second call to a customer disappears into the same opportunity. Nobody would have known about the plotter AND copier sale if I didn't call Alyssa manually."*

**Phase 2 fixes this.** Multi-job detection from single conversation.

## NEW SLIDE: Joe's Progress Is Proof

**Headline:** The Training System Is Already Working

| Joe's Growth | Evidence |
|--------------|----------|
| Handling medium complexity jobs solo | ✅ Confirmed |
| Running the printing operation | **$2,000 in sticker revenue in 3 weeks** |
| Creating designs | Made QR code stickers linking to websites |
| Ready for more independence | "Joe, just get with this guy and print his stickers" |

**Quote:**
> *"I told Joe, 'Print his stickers.' We printed $2,000 worth of stickers for this guy in the last three weeks."*

**What this means:**
- Joe is already scaling beyond service
- Training system investment = multiplied capacity
- Path to hiring "Steve" (third tech) is clear

## NEW SLIDE: The Hidden Business Inside

**Headline:** Mighty Picks: The $___K Opportunity Sitting Idle

**What we discovered:**

| Asset | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Printing equipment | Already owned, sitting idle |
| LLC entity | Mighty Picks LLC (Kelsey's main LLC) |
| Existing revenue | $2,000 in 3 weeks (Joe's work) |
| Timeline to launch | 6 months (Kelsey's target) |

**What's missing:**
- Website
- Flexi integration for job costing
- Inventory tracking (ink cartridges)
- Workflow integration with Jobber

**Quote:**
> *"The printers are just sitting idle over there. There's no sense of them doing nothing when they could be making money."*

**Phase 2 connection:** Inventory system + workflow = foundation for Mighty Picks launch

---

## NEW SLIDE: Consultation as Revenue

**Headline:** Kelsey Is Already a Consultant (He Just Doesn't Charge for It)

**Evidence:**
- Client called him to **consult WITH the printer manufacturer** on a diagnosis
- He's already saying "I'll have to assess the situation first"
- Competitors can't match his 20+ years of expertise

**Quote:**
> *"At the end of the day, you make more money as a consultant. I'm a solutions provider, not a salesman."*

**Phase 2 Opportunity:**
- Separate consultation tier pricing
- "Assessment visit" workflow in Jobber
- Knowledge base that captures his diagnostic expertise

---

## UPDATED SLIDE: The Real Vision (Not Just Pinetop)

**Headline:** "Bread on the Water"

*The vision isn't just a lake house. It's something bigger.*

**What Kelsey actually said:**
> *"Once I get freed up from this thing and get this thing running efficiently, I'm going to start a ministry called Bread on the Water."*

**The Ministry:**
- Houseboat-based youth mentorship
- Kids without fathers (incarcerated, absent)
- No phones, just Jesus, fishing, campfires, paddleboarding
- Already has houseboats + Arizona nonprofit entity

**Why this matters for the pitch:**
- This is Kelsey's REAL "why"
- It's not about money — it's about freedom to serve
- Phase 2 = the operational efficiency that enables the ministry

**Quote:**
> *"I love helping people. That's why I fix printers."*

- Ministry/service imagery (subtle)

**Tone shift:**

- More "freedom to serve" / "run the business to fund the mission"

**Key emotional beat:**
> Kelsey doesn't want to be rich. He wants to be **free** — free to help kids who grew up like he did.
