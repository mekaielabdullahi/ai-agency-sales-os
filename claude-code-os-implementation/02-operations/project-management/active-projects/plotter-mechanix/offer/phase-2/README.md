   - Can't link items to PO numbers
   - RMA backlog from last year unresolved

## 🎯 Key Messages for Presentation

### The Hook

### The Vision
"Transform from a service business limited by your hours to a knowledge business that scales through documented expertise."

### The Choice
- **Status Quo:** Revenue capped at your physical presence
- **Transform:** Build a scalable knowledge platform

### The Ask
"Choose your transformation level - Foundation, Growth, or Full Scale. We'll start with Week 1 quick wins while building the rest."

## ❓ FAQ

**Q: Why three tiers instead of one price?**
A: Different budgets and urgency levels. Foundation fixes the crisis, Growth enables scaling, Full Scale transforms the business.

**Q: What about Ply integration?**
A: We'll build with integration in mind. Inventory system can work standalone or integrate with Ply when ready.

**Q: Can we add components later?**
A: Yes, the platform is modular. Start with Foundation, add Growth components as needed.

**Q: What's the February urgency?**
A: Kelsey's hiring 2 new techs = 400 hours of training. The training system alone pays for itself with these hires.
