# Plotter Mechanix Training Center Vision
## From Knowledge Bottleneck to Knowledge Platform

**Date:** February 6, 2026
**Purpose:** Detail the transformation of Kelsey's expertise into a scalable training system

## The Core Concept

Transform Kelsey from the single point of knowledge to the architect of a learning ecosystem where:
- **Kelsey's expertise** becomes documented and accessible
- **Technicians learn** through structured pathways
- **Knowledge grows** as techs contribute discoveries
- **Business scales** without Kelsey doing every call

AI: "Based on Kelsey's training, this is likely the carriage belt.
Here's what to check:
1. [Shows video clip of belt inspection]
2. Listen for noise location [audio sample]
3. Check belt tension [specification guide]

Need more help? [Video Call Kelsey] [Ask Another Tech]"
```
