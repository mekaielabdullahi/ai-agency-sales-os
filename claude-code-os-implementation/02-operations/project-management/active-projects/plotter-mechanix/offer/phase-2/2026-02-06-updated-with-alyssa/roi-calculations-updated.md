## 🚨 CRITICAL: Information Still Missing

### URGENT - Blocks Accurate Pricing

| Missing Data | Why Critical | How to Get |
|--------------|--------------|------------|
| **Alyssa's actual hourly rate** | ROI calculations use $20-30 estimate | Ask Alyssa directly |
| **Kelsey's actual weekly hours** | Using 50 hr estimate | Ask Nikki or Kelsey |
| **2025 actual revenue** | All ROI percentages based on this | Ask Nikki (bookkeeper) |
| **Service call volume/week** | Capacity calculations | Pull from Jobber |
| **Joe's hourly rate** | Training comparison | Ask Joe directly |

### IMPORTANT - Affects ROI Accuracy

| Missing Data | Current Assumption | Impact |
|--------------|-------------------|--------|
| Email processing actual time breakdown | 4-5 hrs/day total | May be higher with interruptions |
| Vendor response times | 30 min average | Affects parts ROI |
| RMA resolution value | Unknown | Lost vendor credits |
| Inventory value | ~$50k estimate | Carrying cost calculations |
| Customer count | Unknown | Contract opportunity sizing |

### Would Be Nice - Strengthens Story

| Missing Data | Why Helpful | Priority |
|--------------|-------------|----------|
| Shopify order volume | Quantify that pain point | Low |
| Number of missed calls | Lost revenue opportunity | Medium |
| Error rate from duplicates | Quality impact | Low |
| Kelsey's stress level | Quality of life angle | Medium |

## Key Revelations from Alyssa Part 2

1. **Email is 50% of Alyssa's job** - This alone justifies Phase 2
2. **No inventory system exists** - They're flying blind on $50k+ of parts
3. **Duplicate clients breaking QuickBooks** - Data integrity crisis
4. **45 minutes per parts order** - 2-3x longer than it should be
5. **Alyssa already building solutions** - "Printer info for dummies" shows initiative

---

## The Bottom Line

The Alyssa Part 2 interview revealed the operational burden is **2-3x worse than originally estimated**.

| Original Estimate | Validated Reality | Impact |
|-------------------|-------------------|--------|
| Email: "constant switching" | **50% of her time (20-25 hrs/week)** | 2.5x worse |
| Parts ordering: Unknown | **45 minutes per order** | Major time sink |
| Inventory system: Assumed exists | **Doesn't exist at all** | Crisis level |
| Duplicate entries: Minor issue | **Breaking QuickBooks integration** | System failure |

### February 2026 Reality Check

If nothing changes:
- **Alyssa will spend 1,000+ hours this year managing email**
- **Kelsey will spend 400+ hours training new techs**
- **Combined: 1,400 hours (35 work weeks) of pure waste**

**The question isn't whether to do Phase 2. It's whether you can afford NOT to.**
