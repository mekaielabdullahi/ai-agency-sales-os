# Plotter Mechanix Phase 2 Proposal
## Operations Transformation & Automation Platform

**Date:** February 6, 2026
**Prepared For:** Kelsey Hartzell, Plotter Mechanix
**Prepared By:** AI Agency Development Team

---

## Executive Summary

Your operations are drowning. Alyssa spends **50% of her time (20-25 hours/week) managing email** across 10 inboxes. You have no inventory system. Duplicate entries are breaking QuickBooks. Every new technician costs you 120-200 hours of training time.

Phase 2 will recover **30-40 hours per week** of productive time between Kelsey and Alyssa, while building the foundation for sustainable growth.

**Investment Options:**
- **Foundation:** $15,000 (Alyssa crisis relief)
- **Growth:** $28,000 (Add Kelsey optimization)
- **Full Scale:** $42,000 (Complete transformation)

**ROI:** 3-5 month payback with $206,000-$384,000 annual value created

## The Crisis We Discovered

### Alyssa's Reality (From Feb 6 Interview)

> *"That's the majority of my time... Maybe about four or five hours [per day on email]"*
> — Alyssa, February 6, 2026

| Task | Time/Week | % of Her Time |
|------|-----------|---------------|
| **Email management** | 20-25 hours | **50%** |
| Data entry | 3.5 hours | 8% |
| Parts ordering | 2-3 hours | 6% |
| Other tasks | 13-16 hours | 36% |

### The Broken Systems

**Email Chaos:**
- 10 separate inboxes requiring manual checking
- Notification system broke after recent update
- Duplicate emails across multiple inboxes
- Service email can't send outbound

**Data Integrity Crisis:**
- Duplicate clients breaking QuickBooks ("We have seven Daves")
- Can't merge duplicate requests in Jobber
- Manual copy-paste workarounds daily
- 30 minutes/day wasted on reconciliation

**Inventory Black Hole:**
- **No inventory system exists at all**
- Manual checking: "I think we have them, let me check..."
- Can't link items to PO numbers for RMAs
- Pile of unresolved RMAs from last year

**Parts Ordering Burden:**
- 45 minutes per order (30 min research + 15 min vendor)
- Complex parts can take days
- HP specialist calls required

## What We've Already Built (Demo Site Ready)

### ✅ Customer Portal (Live Demo Available)
**URL:** plottermechanix.demo.site/portal

**Current Features:**
- Service request tracking
- Invoice history and payment
- Job status monitoring
- Direct messaging with team
- Equipment history per customer
- Schedule service appointments

**Customer Benefits:**
- 24/7 access to their information
- No more "what's my job status?" calls
- Self-service reduces Alyssa's load

### ✅ Supplies Portal (Needs Enhancement)
**URL:** plottermechanix.demo.site/dashboard/supplies

**Current Features:**
- Real-time inventory tracking
- Location tracking (warehouse/trucks)
- Low stock alerts
- Category filtering
- Basic quantity management

**Missing (What Alyssa Needs):**
Based on the Feb 6 interview, we need to add:
- **Barcode scanning** for receiving
- **PO number linking** for RMA tracking
- **Vendor catalog integration** for ordering
- **Automatic reorder points**
- **Parts lookup by printer model**
- **"Printer Info for Dummies" knowledge base** (Alyssa already started this!)

---

## Phase 2 Components & ROI

### 1. 🚨 Email & Communication Hub (TOP PRIORITY)
**Investment: $5,000-$7,000**

**The Problem:**
- 50% of Alyssa's time on email (20-25 hrs/week)
- 10 inboxes with broken notifications
- Manual checking required constantly

**The Solution:**
- Consolidate 10 inboxes → 2 master inboxes
- Unified dashboard showing all communications
- Smart routing and auto-labeling
- Integration with Jobber for auto-actions
- Mobile app for vacation coverage

**ROI: $14,560-$28,600/year**
- 10-13 hours/week recovered
- Equivalent to hiring a part-time assistant

---

### 2. 🔧 Duplicate Prevention & Data Integrity
**Investment: $3,000-$4,000**

**The Problem:**
- "We have seven Daves" - duplicate clients everywhere
- Breaking QuickBooks integration
- 30 min/day manual reconciliation

**The Solution:**
- Smart matching algorithm before creating clients
- Automatic merge suggestions
- QuickBooks sync validation
- One-click duplicate resolution

**ROI: $4,160-$6,240/year**
- 2.5 hours/week recovered
- Prevent QuickBooks sync failures

---

### 3. 📦 Inventory & Barcode System (Alyssa's #1 Wish)
**Investment: $4,000-$6,000**

**The Problem:**
> *"If we had barcodes, that would be so much easier"*
> — Alyssa

- No inventory visibility
- Can't resolve RMAs without PO history
- Manual checking for every order

**The Solution (Enhancing Demo Portal):**
- Barcode scanning on receive
- Link every item to PO number
- Real-time stock across locations
- Automatic RMA tracking
- Vendor catalog integration
- Mobile scanner app

**ROI: $5,640-$9,460/year**
- 2-3 hours/week recovered
- RMA credits recovered
- Eliminate stockouts

---

### 4. 🧠 Parts Catalog & Knowledge Base
**Investment: $8,000-$12,000**

**The Problem:**
- 45 minutes per parts order
- Alyssa doesn't know which parts fit which printer
- Already creating "Printer Info for Dummies" herself

**The Solution (Leveraging Alyssa's Work):**
- Interactive parts finder by printer model
- Customer self-service portal for common questions
- Vendor catalog integration
- AI-powered parts matching
- Build on Alyssa's existing documentation

**Features in Demo:**
```
Customer: "I have an HP T630, what paper do I need?"
Portal: Shows compatible papers, stock status, instant quote
Result: No call to Alyssa needed
```

**ROI: $4,853-$7,280/year**
- 20 minutes per order saved
- Reduce customer inquiry calls

---

### 5. 🎓 Training System (Video Library)
**Investment: $8,000-$18,000**

**The Problem (Joe Validated):**
> *"20-30 hours per week initially... took me a good 3 months"*
> — Joe

- Each new tech costs 120-200 hours of Kelsey's time
- February: 2 new techs = 200 hours = $35,000 lost revenue

**The Solution:**
- 25-30 training videos by equipment type
- Mobile-accessible for field reference
- Skill tracking dashboard
- Reduce training to 30-50 hours

**ROI: $31,500-$78,750/year**
- 90-150 hours saved per hire
- Faster tech independence

---

### 6. 📅 Morning Coordination Automation
**Investment: $3,000-$6,000**

**The Problem (Joe):**
> *"1.5-2 hours every morning planning routes... Most frustrating part of my day"*

**The Solution:**
- Auto-route optimization
- Drag-drop schedule adjustments
- Mobile sync for field changes
- Customer notifications

**ROI: $12,500-$15,625/year**
- 1+ hour/day recovered

## Why This Investment Makes Sense

### The Math
- **Alyssa's wasted time:** 20-25 hrs/week on email = $20-30k/year
- **Kelsey's training burden:** 200 hrs in February alone = $35k
- **Combined annual waste:** $200,000+
- **Phase 2 investment:** $15-42k (one-time)
- **Payback period:** 3-5 months

### The Reality Check
Without Phase 2:
- Alyssa will spend **1,000+ hours** this year on email
- Kelsey will spend **400+ hours** training techs
- You'll lose **$50,000+** in productivity

With Phase 2:
- Recover 30-40 hours/week immediately
- Scale without hiring more admin
- Actually take that Pinetop vacation
