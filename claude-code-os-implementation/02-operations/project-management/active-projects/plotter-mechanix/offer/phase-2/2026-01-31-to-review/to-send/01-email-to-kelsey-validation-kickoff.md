# Email to Kelsey: Phase 2 Validation Kickoff

**To:** Kelsey
**Subject:** Phase 2 Next Steps - Quick Data Collection (2-3 Weeks)

---

Hi Kelsey,

We're putting together Phase 2 for Plotter Mechanix to help you scale the business and free up your time from low-ROI tasks. Before we finalize the proposal, we want to validate our ROI estimates with **real data from your business** (not assumptions).

## What We Need (2-3 Weeks)

### 1. Time Tracking (You + Alyssa) - 5 Business Days
We've created simple templates to track:
- **You:** Time spent training Joe each day
- **Alyssa:** Email processing, "Do we have X?" interruptions, context-switching, equipment lookups, data entry

**Why:** This validates how much time our systems will actually save.

### 2. Quick Interviews (30-45 Min Each)
- **Megan:** Ply implementation status, what we can help with
- **Andrew:** Supplies process, tools that would help him scale
- **You:** Current challenges, priorities, budget for Phase 2
- **Alyssa:** Day-to-day workflow, biggest time wasters

**Why:** Make sure Phase 2 solves the RIGHT problems and supports what Megan/Andrew are already building.

### 3. Business Data
- Jobber data export (customers, jobs, service history)
- Revenue/customer count (so we can validate contract revenue opportunity)

**Why:** Calculate realistic ROI based on YOUR business, not industry averages.

## The Goal

Replace **assumptions** with **your real data**, then present Phase 2 with confidence:
- "Here's what we measured in your business"
- "Here's the validated ROI based on YOUR numbers"
- "Here's what we'll build and exactly what it's worth to you"

This process protects you from vendors who promise the moon and deliver nothing (like the 2-3 you worked with before).

## Timeline

| Week | Action |
|------|--------|
| **Week 1-2** | Time tracking (5 days) + Interviews |
| **Week 3** | We compile data and finalize Phase 2 proposal |
| **Week 3-4** | Present Phase 2 with data-backed ROI, close if it makes sense |
| **Week 4-10** | Phase 2 delivery (4-6 weeks) |

---

## Next Steps

1. **Reply "yes"** if you're on board with this validation approach
2. I'll send Alyssa her time tracking template (super simple, 2 min/day)
3. I'll send you your time tracking template
4. We'll schedule interviews with Megan, Andrew, you, and Alyssa

Sound good?
