# Phase 2 Team Review - Feedback & Action Items

**Review Date:** January 28, 2026
**Participants:** Internal team review
**Status:** In Progress

---

## Feedback Summary

### Feedback 1: Tiered Pricing Options Required

**Issue:** The current proposal only offers a single $47k option. Kelsey needs choices - including less expensive options that still deliver high value.

**Rationale:**
- Kelsey's business is growing fast but cash flow may not support $47k upfront
- Single-price proposals feel like "take it or leave it"
- Tiered options let the client self-select based on budget AND urgency
- Lower tiers still need to be highly valuable (not throwaway)

**Action:** Create 3 tiered options (see Proposed Tiers below).

---

### Feedback 2: New Context from Jan 27 Kelsey Call

**Key signals that affect Phase 2 scope:**

| New Information | Impact |
|-----------------|--------|
| Kelsey handling 7+ daily service calls | Demand is surging - scaling infrastructure urgent |
| Revenue doubling target ($1.2M-$1.7M+) | ROI calculations may need updating (higher base revenue) |
| Revenue $100k+ more than prior year despite problems | Baseline is NOT $600k -- trending $700-800k current |
| Andrew fully operational (email, Quo, Jobber, all inboxes) | Confirms "support not replace" - he's live, not ramping |
| Steve permanently off table (personal issues, no return calls) | Remove from all plans; pivot to Michael Maloney |
| Joe more capable than assumed (Apache Rental solo, 10yr cutter exp) | Can handle customer-facing work independently |
| Kelsey's dyslexia = hard UX constraint | *"I can't learn on the fly with software I've never seen before"* -- validates chat agent as accessibility solution |
| Payment concern despite growth | *"I don't even know how I'm gonna pay you"* -- directly validates tiered pricing |
| Kelsey set Quo as default phone, hiding cell call button | Strong platform buy-in; Phase 2 builds on this |
| Kelsey wants Siri voice texting to office number | Voice-first approach has strong user buy-in |
| Competitor supply chain issues (HP credit holds) | Market tailwind driving demand -- window of opportunity |
| IVR call routing decided (5 extensions) | Pre-recorded menu, NOT AI front-end. AI as fallback only |
| Subcontractor network forming | Former Plotter Doctors employee + Michael Maloney (burned out from full-time + side work) |
| Kelsey wants to be our case study | *"I'm gonna be your commercial"* -- high trust, credibility asset |

**Design Principle:** Voice-first, dyslexia-friendly interfaces. Any new system must be conversational or extremely simple. Chat agent is an accessibility solution, not just efficiency.

**Action:** Meeting notes filed at `meetings/2026-01-27-kelsey-operations-update/summary.md`

## Proposed Tiered Options

### Option 1: Foundation - $15,000

**Focus:** Solve the #1 information bottleneck with the highest-ROI, lowest-risk deliverable.

| Deliverable | Investment | Annual ROI |
|-------------|-----------|------------|
| Equipment Management (evaluate + implement) | $8,000 | $37,600 |
| Integration Work (Jobber + Quo) | $4,000 | Efficiency |
| Discovery & Architecture | $3,000 | Foundation |
| **TOTAL** | **$15,000** | **$37,600+** |

**What Kelsey gets:**
- Evaluation and selection of best equipment management platform for printer/plotter service (Miracle Service, Field Force Tracker, BlueFolder, or custom)
- Customer equipment database (serial #s, models, install dates, meter readings)
- Maintenance history linked to Jobber jobs
- Service contract eligibility scoring (identify $99/mo candidates)
- Proactive maintenance reminders
- Connected to existing Quo-Jobber infrastructure
- Capsule CRM legacy data audit and migration plan

**Why this works standalone:**
- Lowest adoption risk (passive system, no behavior change required)
- Highest standalone ROI ($37,600/yr on $15k = 251%)
- Directly enables service contract revenue (Andrew can sell these)
- Payback in ~5 months
- Foundation for everything else in future phases
- Using an off-the-shelf platform reduces build risk vs. custom development

**What it does NOT include:**
- Training video system
- Chat agent
- Email automation
- Ply integration

**Value-to-Price Ratio:** 2.5:1 (meets industry target)

---

### Option 2: Growth Engine - $28,000

**Focus:** Equipment management platform + the unified interface that eliminates context-switching.

| Deliverable | Investment | Annual ROI |
|-------------|-----------|------------|
| Equipment Management (evaluate + implement) | $8,000 | $37,600 |
| Unified Chat Agent | $10,000 | $25,000 |
| Email Automation | $5,000 | $15,000 |
| Integration Work | $5,000 | Efficiency |
| **TOTAL** | **$28,000** | **$77,600** |

**What Kelsey gets (everything in Option 1, plus):**
- Single chat interface for ALL data queries (Ply for inventory, equipment platform for customer devices, Quo, Jobber)
- "Do we have HP 730 ink?" answered in seconds (not 2-5 min)
- Auto-populated customer context when calls come in
- Vendor email automation (pricing extraction, RMA routing, PO tracking)
- Alyssa's context-switching cut by 80%

**Why this tier:**
- Solves the two biggest daily pain points (equipment lookup + system switching)
- Chat agent is the force multiplier for everything else
- Email automation pays for itself in Alyssa's time
- ROI: 277% ($77,600 on $28k)
- Payback in ~4.3 months

**What it does NOT include:**
- Training video system (Chris filming, 25-30 video library)

**Value-to-Price Ratio:** 2.8:1 (exceeds industry target)

---

### Option 3: Full Scale - $47,000

**Focus:** Complete infrastructure to scale from ~$700-800k to $6M without breaking.

| Deliverable | Investment | Annual ROI |
|-------------|-----------|------------|
| Training System | $18,000 | $39,000 |
| Equipment Management (evaluate + implement) | $10,000 | $37,600 |
| Unified Chat Agent | $10,000 | $25,000 |
| Email Automation | $5,000 | $15,000 |
| Integration Work | $4,000 | Efficiency |
| **TOTAL** | **$47,000** | **$116,600** |

**What Kelsey gets (everything in Option 2, plus):**
- Chris films Kelsey during service calls
- 25-30 video library covering common repairs, procedures, customer interaction
- Searchable knowledge base for new tech onboarding
- New techs onboard in 2-3 weeks instead of 4-6 weeks
- Ready to scale team (Michael Maloney, subcontractors, or next hire)

**Why this tier:**
- Only option that solves the knowledge transfer bottleneck
- Kelsey's expertise captured permanently (the "clone Kelsey" goal)
- Enables scaling to 3+ technicians
- ROI: 248% ($116,600 on $47k)
- Payback in ~4.8 months

**Value-to-Price Ratio:** 3.3:1 (exceeds industry target)

## Updated Context: Revenue Implications

The Jan 27 call changes the ROI picture:

**Previous assumption:** $600k revenue
**Updated signal:** Kelsey targeting $1.2M-$1.7M+ this year

If revenue is actually trending toward $1.2M:
- 5% customer retention improvement = $60k/year (was $30k)
- Training time at higher hourly value = proportionally more
- Scaling bottleneck is MORE expensive to ignore

**Recommendation:** Don't update ROI numbers yet - validate during the data collection phase. But the case for Phase 2 is getting STRONGER, not weaker.

## Open Questions for Team

1. **Are the tier breakdowns right?** Does Equipment Management make sense as the standalone Option 1?
2. **Should Option 2 include Ply enhancement layer** instead of email automation?
3. **Training system pricing at $18k** - is this accurate for Chris filming + video production + knowledge base?
4. **Timeline per tier** - Option 1 could be 2-3 weeks, Option 2 could be 3-4 weeks
5. **Do we still need the full validation phase** or can we present tiers sooner given business momentum?
6. **Which equipment management platform?** We should evaluate purpose-built solutions before committing to a custom build:
   - **Miracle Service** -- 30+ years in the printer service industry, meter billing, managed print services
   - **Field Force Tracker** -- printer/copier specific field service management
   - **BlueFolder** -- equipment tracking with serial numbers and service history
   - **IndusTrack** -- field service equipment management
   - **Custom build** -- only if off-the-shelf platforms don't fit
   - _Action: Research and demo these before Phase 2 build begins_
7. **Capsule CRM legacy data** -- Kelsey is still paying ~$30/mo for Capsule, which has old customer contacts not migrated to Jobber. What should happen with this data? Migrate to Jobber? To the equipment management platform? Audit and decide during validation.

## Documentation Consistency Flags

### Equipment vs Inventory Distinction
**Issue:** Across Phase 2 documents, "Equipment CRM" and "inventory" are sometimes used interchangeably. These are separate systems:

- **Equipment** = customer printers/plotters/cutters at their locations (serial numbers, models, service history, contracts). This is what the Equipment Management deliverable addresses.
- **Inventory/Consumables** = Plotter Mechanix's own stock (printheads, inks, paper, belts, maintenance kits). This is what Ply handles.
- **Ply (getply.com)** = inventory/consumables management only. Handles parts tracking, truck stock, purchase orders, barcode scanning, Jobber integration. Does NOT track customer equipment.

All Phase 2 documents should maintain this distinction consistently.

## Next Steps

- [ ] Team reviews tiered options and provides feedback
- [ ] Decide which tiers to include in client-facing proposal
- [ ] Update PHASE-2-PROPOSAL.md with tiered pricing
- [ ] Incorporate Jan 27 meeting context into proposal narrative
- [ ] Decide on validation phase timeline vs. presenting sooner
