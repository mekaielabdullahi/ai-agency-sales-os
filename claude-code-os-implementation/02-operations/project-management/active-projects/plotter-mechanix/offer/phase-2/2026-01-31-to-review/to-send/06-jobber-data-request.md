# Email to Kelsey: Jobber Data Export Request

**To:** Kelsey
**Subject:** Jobber Data Export for Phase 2 ROI Validation

---

Hi Kelsey,

To validate the ROI for Phase 2 (especially the Equipment CRM and service contract opportunity), we need to analyze your Jobber data. This helps us calculate realistic revenue potential based on YOUR customer base, not industry averages.

## What We Need

**Jobber data export** including:
- Customers (name, contact info, active status)
- Jobs/service calls (dates, equipment serviced, job types)
- Invoices (amounts, payment status, frequency)
- Equipment types (from job descriptions/notes)

## How to Export from Jobber

### Option 1: Direct Export (If You Have Admin Access)
1. Log into Jobber
2. Go to **Reports** → **Export Data**
3. Select date range: **Last 12 months** (or all-time if available)
4. Export: **Customers, Jobs, Invoices**
5. Send CSV files to matthew@arisegroup.ai

### Option 2: Grant Us Temporary Read-Only Access
If exporting is complex, you can:
1. Create a temporary read-only user for us in Jobber
2. We'll export the data ourselves
3. Revoke access once we're done

### Option 3: Jobber Support Can Help
Contact Jobber support and request a data export for "business analysis purposes"

## What We'll Analyze

### 1. Service Contract Opportunity
**Questions:**
- How many customers have 3+ service calls per year? (contract candidates)
- What's the average revenue per customer annually?
- What equipment types are most common?

**Why:** Validates the $37,600/year ROI estimate for Equipment CRM

---

### 2. Customer Churn & Retention
**Questions:**
- How many customers had service in 2024 but not 2025?
- What's the retention rate year-over-year?
- What's the value of a lost customer?

**Why:** Validates the customer retention ROI from better service tracking

---

### 3. Equipment Inventory
**Questions:**
- What equipment brands/models do customers have? (HP, Canon, Epson, etc.)
- How many customers per equipment type?
- What parts are needed most often?

**Why:** Helps populate Equipment CRM with actual data and informs inventory decisions

---

### 4. Revenue Validation
**Questions:**
- Total revenue last 12 months?
- Service revenue vs. supplies revenue split?
- Average invoice size?

**Why:** Validates our $600k annual revenue estimate and calculates realistic ROI

## Data Privacy

**We will:**
- ✅ Use data ONLY for ROI analysis and Phase 2 planning
- ✅ Keep all data confidential (no sharing with third parties)
- ✅ Delete data after analysis complete (unless you want us to keep for future reference)
- ✅ Share analysis report with you for transparency

**We will NOT:**
- ❌ Contact your customers
- ❌ Share data with competitors
- ❌ Use data for any other purpose

---

## Timeline

**Ideal:** Export this week so we can analyze before Week 3 proposal presentation

**If that's tight:**
- We can analyze partial data (just last 6 months)
- Or focus on top 50 customers only
- Or work with anonymized summary data

---

## What You'll Get

**Analysis Report Including:**
- Service contract revenue opportunity ($XX,XXX estimate)
- Customer retention value ($XX,XXX)
- Equipment CRM ROI validation
- Top 20 customers by revenue/frequency
- Inventory insights (most common parts needed)

This report alone is valuable—helps you understand your business better even outside Phase 2.

## Questions?

- **"Is this secure?"** → Yes, we handle client data daily and follow best practices
- **"How long will this take?"** → 2-3 hours to analyze once we have the data
- **"What if Jobber won't export?"** → We can work with screen recordings or manual summaries

Let me know if you need help with the export or have questions!
