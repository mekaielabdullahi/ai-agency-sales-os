# Email to Andrew: Interview Scheduling

**To:** Andrew
**CC:** Kelsey
**Subject:** Quick Chat About Supplies Process + How We Can Help (30 Min)

---

Hi Andrew,

Kelsey mentioned you're ramping up the supplies side of Plotter Mechanix. We're putting together Phase 2 and want to make sure we **support your process** (not dictate it or get in the way).

## What We Need

**30-minute interview** to understand:
1. Your vision for supplies growth
2. Your current process (how you track customers, orders, follow-ups)
3. What tools would help you scale without adding overhead
4. What you DON'T need from us (so we stay out of your way)

## Topics We'll Cover

### Current Supplies Process
- How do you currently manage supplies customers?
- Where do you track orders, pricing, customer relationships?
- What's your follow-up process for reorders?
- How do you identify new supplies opportunities?

### Growth Vision
- Revenue goal for supplies in next 6-12 months?
- Constraints or bottlenecks you're hitting?
- What would make scaling easier?

### Tools & Support
- What do you track manually that could be automated?
- Do you need a CRM or sales pipeline? Or is your current method working?
- Email automation for supplies quotes/follow-ups?
- Integration with Ply or Jobber for supplies inventory?

### What to Avoid
- What systems or tools do you NOT want us to build?
- What parts of your process should we not touch?

## Why This Matters

We want to build tools that **fit YOUR workflow**, not force you into a system that creates more work. For example:

**If your current process works:**
→ We won't build a fancy CRM you'll never use
→ We might just add simple automation (email templates, reorder reminders)

**If you're hitting bottlenecks:**
→ We'll build lightweight tools to remove friction
→ Example: Automated supplies quote generator, customer reorder tracking

Your domain knowledge on supplies is the asset—we just want to amplify it with the right tools.

## Scheduling

**When works for you?**
- [ ] This week: [suggest 2-3 time slots]
- [ ] Next week: [suggest 2-3 time slots]
- [ ] I'll send you my calendar link

**Format:**
- [ ] Video call (Zoom/Meet)

We'll keep it casual—just need 30 minutes to understand your process and where we can help.

## What You'll Get Out of This

- Clarity on how Phase 2 can support supplies growth (if it makes sense)
- No pressure to adopt systems you don't need
- Input on Phase 2 priorities

Looking forward to learning from you!
