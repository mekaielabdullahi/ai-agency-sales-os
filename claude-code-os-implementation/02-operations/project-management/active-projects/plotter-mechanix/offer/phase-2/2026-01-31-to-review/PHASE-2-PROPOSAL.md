# Plotter Mechanix Phase 2 Proposal
## Building a Business That Scales to 10x

**Presented by:** Arise Group AI
**Date:** January 28, 2026
**Investment:** $15,000 - $47,000 (3 tier options)
**Timeline:** 4-6 weeks
**Expected ROI Range:** $68,000 - $160,000/year (estimated -- ranges narrow after validation with YOUR data)

---

## Executive Summary

Phase 1 proved we can reduce friction in your business -- Quo-Jobber integration is deployed and working, and Kelsey chose Quo as his default phone app. Phase 2 prepares Plotter Mechanix to scale from ~$700-800k (trending toward $1.2M-$1.7M) to $6M revenue without breaking.

**The Core Question:** If you were 10x your size tomorrow, what breaks?

**The Answer:** Five bottlenecks that compound with growth:
1. **Knowledge Transfer** - Kelsey can't train 20 techs personally
2. **Information Flow** - Context-switching kills 20+ hours/week at scale
3. **Inventory Visibility** - Manual tracking collapses at 10,000 SKUs
4. **Communication Overload** - 1,000 emails/day drowns the team
5. **Customer Intelligence** - Service history in Kelsey's head doesn't scale

**Our Role:** Support what Andrew and Megan are building (supplies, Ply), fill the gaps, and validate ROI with YOUR business data.

**Investment Options (ROI ranges narrow after validation):**
- **Foundation:** $15,000 -- estimated $25,000-$52,000/year ROI
- **Growth Engine:** $28,000 -- estimated $48,000-$112,000/year ROI
- **Full Scale:** $47,000 -- estimated $68,000-$160,000/year ROI

**Estimated Payback:** 4-8 months across all tiers
**Estimated Value-to-Price:** 1.4:1 to 3.4:1 (range narrows after validation with your data)

## The 10x Scale Reality Check

### Current State (1x)
- Revenue: ~$700-800k/year (trending toward $1.2M-$1.7M target)
- Technicians: 2-3 (Kelsey, Joe, subcontractors)
- Supplies/Sales: Andrew (fully operational -- email, Quo, Jobber, all inboxes)
- Service calls/week: 35+ (7+ daily and rising)
- Active customers: 100-200
- Inventory SKUs: 500-1,000
- Emails/day: 50-100 (10 inboxes)

**What works:** Kelsey knows every customer, Alyssa manages manually, whiteboard inventory, direct training. Phase 1 Quo-Jobber integration deployed and working -- Kelsey chose Quo as default phone.

**Kelsey's UX needs:** Kelsey has dyslexia and cannot learn new software on the fly. Any Phase 2 system must be voice-friendly, conversational, or extremely simple. This makes the chat agent approach an accessibility solution, not just an efficiency play.

---

### Future State (10x - Without Changes)
- Revenue: **$6,000,000/year**
- Technicians: **20-30 techs**
- Service calls/week: **200-300**
- Active customers: **1,000-2,000**
- Inventory SKUs: **5,000-10,000**
- Emails/day: **500-1,000**

**What breaks:**
- ❌ Kelsey can't train 20 techs (would need 100 hrs/week)
- ❌ Alyssa drowns in 500 emails/day
- ❌ Whiteboard can't track 10,000 SKUs
- ❌ Manual handoffs = 50+ dropped balls/week
- ❌ Service history in Kelsey's head = impossible

**Result:** Revenue ceiling at $1-2M before chaos

## How to Read Our ROI Estimates

Every ROI figure in this proposal is presented as a **range**, not a single number. This is intentional.

**Why ranges?** We don't have YOUR data yet. The estimates below are based on industry benchmarks, discovery call insights, and reasonable assumptions. Some of those assumptions will be wrong -- ranges let us be honest about what we know vs. what we're estimating.

| Confidence Level | What It Means | How We'll Narrow It |
|-----------------|---------------|---------------------|
| **LOW** | Based on assumptions we haven't measured (e.g., how many hours Kelsey trains Joe/week) | Week 1 time tracking + interviews |
| **MEDIUM** | Based on industry benchmarks + partial business data (e.g., email volume is observable) | Jobber data analysis + Megan/Andrew interviews |
| **HIGH** | Validated with your actual business data | Phase 2 validation report (Week 3) |

**What happens next:**
- **Before Phase 2 starts:** We run the validation process (Week 1-3). Ranges narrow significantly based on YOUR measured data.
- **During Phase 2:** As systems go live, we measure actual impact. Ranges narrow further.
- **When we reconvene for Phase 3:** Our ROI estimates will be based on actual performance data -- much tighter ranges, much higher confidence.

**Bottom line:** The conservative end of each range is what we're confident in. The upper end is what we believe is achievable. Validation moves us from guessing to knowing.

## The 5 Business Problems We Solve

### Problem 1: Knowledge Transfer Bottleneck

**Current Cost:** Kelsey spends 5 hours/week training Joe = **$78,000/year** in opportunity cost
**10x Cost:** Would need 100 hrs/week (impossible)

**Our Solution: Training System ($18,000)**
- Chris films Kelsey during service calls
- 25-30 video library (repairs, procedures, customer interaction)
- Searchable knowledge base
- New techs onboard in 2-3 weeks (vs 4-6 weeks)

**Expected ROI:** $20,000 - $48,000/year (25-60% training time reduction)
**Confidence:** LOW -- we assume Kelsey trains 5 hrs/week at $300/hr opportunity cost. Both numbers are unvalidated. Week 1 time tracking will narrow this range significantly.

---

### Problem 2: Information Flow Silos

**Current:** Data trapped in Quo, Jobber, Ply, QuickBooks, email
**Impact:** Context-switching 50+ times/day, "Do we have X?" takes 2-5 minutes
**10x Cost:** $100,000-200,000/year in admin overhead

**Our Solution: Unified Chat Agent ($10,000)**

**One interface for ALL queries:**
- "Do we have HP 730 ink in stock?" → Queries Ply (inventory/consumables)
- "Show me ABC Graphics service history" → Queries Equipment platform + Jobber
- "What equipment does ABC Graphics have?" → Queries Equipment platform (customer devices)
- "What's our revenue this month?" → Queries QuickBooks
- "Are there any open POs for Canon parts?" → Queries email + Jobber

**Auto-context during calls:**
When customer calls → Chat agent displays:
- Customer name and equipment list
- Parts in stock for their equipment
- Service history and open invoices
- Recent communications

**Expected ROI:** $15,000 - $40,000/year (time savings + faster quotes)
**Confidence:** LOW -- we haven't measured how many context switches happen per day or how much time each one costs. Week 1 tracking will nail these numbers down.

**How this supports Megan's Ply work:** Ply stays as inventory system of record. Chat agent queries Ply via API (doesn't replace it). Adds context from other systems Ply doesn't have.

---

### Problem 3: Inventory Visibility & Management

**Current Cost:** Kelsey interrupted 10 times/day with "Do we have X?" = **$62,500/year**
**10x Cost:** $625,000/year (100 interruptions/day)

**Current Initiative:** ✅ Megan setting up Ply for parts inventory and consumables

> **Important Distinction: Equipment ≠ Inventory**
> - **Equipment** = customer printers/plotters/cutters at their locations (tracked by serial number, model, service history, contracts)
> - **Inventory** = your consumables and parts (printheads, inks, paper, belts, maintenance kits) -- handled by Ply
> These are separate systems solving different problems.

**Our Role: Ply Enhancement Layer ($8,000)**

**What Ply handles (Megan's domain -- inventory/consumables):**
- Parts and consumables inventory tracking
- Job material tracking
- Stock alerts and purchase orders
- Jobber sync
- Barcode scanning and truck stock

**What we fill (gaps Ply doesn't cover):**
- **Customer equipment tracking:** Handled by Equipment Management platform (see Problem 5 -- separate from parts inventory)
- **Used parts tracking:** $50k in parted machine inventory currently invisible
- **Chat agent integration:** Inventory visibility during Quo calls
- **Email automation:** Vendor pricing extraction (supports Ply)

**Expected ROI:** $15,000 - $55,000/year (interruption reduction + used parts recovery)
**Confidence:** MEDIUM -- Megan confirmed Ply is in progress and interruption pattern is observable. Used parts value ($50k estimate) needs inventory audit to validate.

---

### Problem 4: Communication Overload

**Current:** Alyssa manages 10 email inboxes manually
**Impact:** Vendor pricing buried in PDFs, RMAs scattered, POs lost
**10x Cost:** $50,000-100,000/year in admin overhead

**Our Solution: Email Automation ($5,000)**

**What gets automated:**
| Email Type | Extraction | Action |
|------------|-----------|--------|
| Vendor pricing PDFs | New prices | Update Ply inventory costs |
| RMA threads | RMA #, status | Flag for Alyssa action |
| PO confirmations | PO #, items, ETA | Link to Jobber job |
| Service requests | Equipment, issue | Create Jobber request draft |

**Expected ROI:** $8,000 - $20,000/year (30-80% email processing time reduction)
**Confidence:** MEDIUM -- email volume is observable and measurable. The 10-inbox structure is confirmed. Actual time-per-email needs Week 1 tracking.

---

### Problem 5: Customer Intelligence Gap

**Current:** Service history in Kelsey's head, no database of customer equipment at their locations
**Impact:** Can't identify contract-eligible customers, reactive only
**10x Cost:** $300,000-500,000/year in missed contract revenue + churn

> **Note:** This problem is about tracking **customer equipment** (printers, plotters, cutters at customer locations) -- not Plotter Mechanix's own parts inventory (which Ply handles). These are fundamentally different systems.

**Our Solution: Equipment Management Platform -- Evaluate, Select & Integrate ($10,000)**

Rather than building a custom Equipment CRM from scratch, we will **research and evaluate the best equipment management solution** for the printer/plotter service industry, then build custom integrations with your existing systems (Quo, Jobber, Ply, chat agent).

**Known off-the-shelf options to evaluate:**
- **Miracle Service** -- 30+ years in printer service industry, meter billing, managed print services
- **Field Force Tracker** -- printer/copier specific field service management
- **BlueFolder** -- equipment tracking with serial numbers and service history
- **Custom build** -- if no off-the-shelf platform fits

**What the selected platform provides:**
- Customer equipment database (serial #s, models, install dates, meter readings)
- Maintenance history (linked to Jobber jobs)
- Service contract eligibility scoring
- Proactive maintenance reminders

**What we build (integrations around the platform):**
- Chat agent connection (query equipment data during calls)
- Quo auto-context (surface customer equipment when they call)
- Ply bridge (link equipment records to consumables/parts in stock)
- Jobber sync (link equipment to service jobs)

**Legacy data: Capsule CRM** -- Kelsey is still paying ~$30/mo for Capsule CRM, which contains legacy customer contacts not yet migrated to Jobber. During the equipment platform evaluation, we'll audit Capsule data and determine where it should migrate (Jobber, the equipment platform, or both).

**Example: When ABC Graphics calls**
```
ABC Graphics
Equipment: HP T730 (Serial ABC123, Installed 2022)
Last Service: Jan 15 (Maintenance kit)
Meter: 45,000 prints (due for service at 50,000)
Service Contract: Eligible (3+ services/year)
Parts in stock: T730 kit (Ply), Printhead (Ply)
```

**Expected ROI:** $25,000 - $52,000/year (contract revenue + retention)
**Confidence:** LOW-MEDIUM -- service contract model is industry-proven, but we need Jobber data to count contract-eligible customers and estimate capture rate. The PK Associates example validates the risk (bad contracts cost real money), but total addressable value needs data.

## Phase 2 Deliverables

### Investment Breakdown: $47,000

| Deliverable | Investment | Annual ROI (Conservative) | Annual ROI (Target) | Confidence | What You Get |
|-------------|------------|--------------------------|--------------------|-----------:|--------------|
| **1. Training System** | $18,000 | $20,000 | $48,000 | LOW | 25-30 videos, knowledge base, Chris filming workflow |
| **2. Equipment Management** | $10,000 | $25,000 | $52,000 | LOW-MED | Evaluate & implement best equipment platform + build integrations |
| **3. Unified Chat Agent** | $10,000 | $15,000 | $40,000 | LOW | Single interface for Ply, Quo, Jobber, QuickBooks, Equipment platform |
| **4. Email Automation** | $5,000 | $8,000 | $20,000 | MEDIUM | Vendor pricing extraction, RMA routing, PO tracking |
| **5. Integration Work** | $4,000 | Efficiency | Efficiency | -- | Connect all systems, data flows automatically |
| **TOTAL** | **$47,000** | **$68,000** | **$160,000** | | |

**ROI Range Summary (Full Scale):**
- Investment: $47,000
- Year 1 Value: **$68,000 - $160,000** (conservative to target)
- ROI: **145% - 340%**
- Estimated Payback: **3.5 - 8 months**
- Value-to-Price: **1.4:1 - 3.4:1**

**What "conservative" means:** The low end assumes lower adoption, fewer contract-eligible customers, and less time waste than estimated. Even at the conservative end, every tier returns more than the investment in Year 1.

**What narrows these ranges:** The Week 1-3 validation process measures YOUR actual numbers (training hours, interruption frequency, email volume, Jobber customer data). After validation, we'll present updated ranges with MEDIUM-HIGH confidence before you commit to the build phase.

**When we reconvene for Phase 3:** Ranges will be based on actual Phase 2 performance data -- much tighter, much higher confidence.

## How We Support (Not Replace) Ongoing Initiatives

### Andrew's Supplies Initiative
**What Andrew is doing:** Fully operational on supplies and sales -- email, Quo, Jobber, and all inbox access. Working for free until revenue comes in. Not ramping -- he's live.

**How we support:**
- Validate what's working and identify gaps now that he's operational
- Ensure inventory system supports supplies SKUs
- Build tools that FIT his workflow (not dictate it)
- Future: Sales pipeline if he needs it (Phase 3)

**What we DON'T do:** Take over his process

---

### Megan's Ply Initiative
**What Megan is doing:** Setting up Ply for inventory and consumables management (printheads, inks, paper, belts, maintenance kits -- your own stock, not customer equipment)

**How we support:**
- Interview to understand implementation status and confirm Ply scope (consumables/inventory only)
- Fill gaps Ply doesn't cover (customer equipment tracking is a separate system -- see Equipment Management deliverable)
- Build chat agent that QUERIES Ply (via API) for "Do we have X in stock?" questions
- Help with printer-specific configuration

**What we DON'T do:** Build competing inventory system. Ply = your consumables. Equipment platform = customer devices at their locations.

---

### Your Phase 1 Foundation
**What we built:** Quo-Jobber integration deployed and working. IVR call routing configured (5 extensions). Kelsey chose Quo as his default phone app.

**How Phase 2 builds on it:**
- Quo webhooks already working → Chat agent receives call context
- N8N infrastructure in place → Add email automation, Ply integration
- AI transcription working → Feed into knowledge base
- IVR routing defined (Service→Kelsey, Supplies→Andrew, Sales→Andrew, Printing→Joe, Accounting→Nikki)

---

*We understand cash flow is important. All tiers deliver high value, and lower tiers can be expanded later as revenue grows. ROI ranges narrow significantly after Week 1-3 validation with your data.*

---

## ROI Validation Process

**Before we finalize Phase 2, we validate the numbers with YOUR business:**

### Week 1-2: Data Collection
**Alyssa tracks (5 business days):**
- Email processing time
- Context-switching frequency
- "Do we have X?" interruptions
- Equipment lookup time
- Manual data entry time

**Kelsey tracks (5 business days):**
- Training time with Joe

**Interviews:**
- Megan (Ply status, API, gaps)
- Andrew (supplies vision, needs)

**Jobber Analysis:**
- Service contract eligible customers
- Customer churn rate
- Equipment types from job history

### Week 3: Validation Report
We compile YOUR data and present updated ROI ranges:
- "Here's what we measured in your business"
- "Here's the updated ROI range based on YOUR numbers" (expect ranges to narrow 40-60%)
- Adjust pricing tier recommendation if data shifts the range significantly
- If conservative ROI doesn't justify the investment at a given tier, we'll recommend a lower tier that fits

**Then we present the final proposal with MEDIUM-HIGH confidence ranges -- not guesses.**

---

## What Phase 2 Does NOT Include

**These are Phase 3 expansion candidates (decide after Phase 2 proves ROI):**

| Module | Investment | Estimated Annual ROI | Confidence | When |
|--------|------------|---------------------|-----------|------|
| Proactive maintenance outreach automation | $10,000 | $30,000 - $90,000 | LOW (needs Phase 2 data) | After equipment platform live |
| Service contract sales automation | $7,000 | $12,000 - $24,000 | LOW | After contract scoring working |
| Andrew's supplies CRM & pipeline | $6,500 | $15,000 - $25,000 | LOW | After Andrew confirms need |
| Customer self-service portal | $15,000 | $6,000 + cash flow | LOW | After core systems stable |
| Predictive maintenance AI | $20,000 | $5,000 - $12,000 | LOW | After 6+ months equipment data |
| Financial dashboard & reporting | $10,000 | $30,000 - $75,000 (decision value) | LOW | After QuickBooks integration |

*Phase 3 ROI ranges are wide because they depend on Phase 2 performance data we don't have yet. By the time we reconvene for Phase 3, we'll have actual numbers from your systems -- tighter ranges, higher confidence.*

---

## The Guarantee

We guarantee the technical deliverables work as specified:
- ✅ Training videos are accessible and searchable
- ✅ Equipment management platform is selected, populated, and integrated
- ✅ Chat agent queries all connected systems correctly
- ✅ Email automation extracts and routes correctly
- ✅ All integrations function as designed

**What we DON'T guarantee (behavioral risk):**
- Team adoption (but we'll support with training)
- Kelsey's behavior change (but systems work whether he changes or not)

**30-day review checkpoints:** We measure actual ROI at 30, 60, and 90 days. Each checkpoint narrows the range. If systems aren't creating value, we course-correct.

**Your protection:** 50% payment on completion ensures we deliver. Validation before build ensures the investment makes sense.

---

## Why This Price is Fair

### Industry Standard (AAA Framework)
**Formula:** Year 1 Value ÷ 2.5 = Recommended Price

**Using our target estimate:**
- Year 1 Target Value: $160,000
- ÷ 2.5 = **$64,000 recommended price**
- Our Price: $47,000 (**27% below** formula recommendation)

**Using our conservative estimate:**
- Year 1 Conservative Value: $68,000
- ÷ 2.5 = **$27,200 recommended price**
- Our Price: $47,000 (**above** conservative formula -- which is why we validate first)

**What this means:** At the target estimate, we're significantly underpricing. At the conservative estimate, our pricing is aggressive. The validation process (Week 1-3) determines where reality falls -- and we'll adjust the final proposal accordingly if the numbers don't support the investment.

**Why we're comfortable with this:** Even the conservative estimate ($68,000/year) returns 145% in Year 1 on the Full Scale tier. The Foundation tier ($15,000) returns 167-347% across the range. Every tier pays for itself in Year 1 even at the low end.

---

### Comparison to Failed Vendors

**Past vendors (per Megan):**
- "2-3 different companies"
- "Lot of money"
- "No results at the end of the day"

**Our Difference:**
1. **Phase 1 proved we deliver** (Quo→Jobber working)
2. **Data-driven pricing** (validated with YOUR business)
3. **Measurable ROI** (track progress every 30 days)
4. **Support ongoing initiatives** (Andrew, Megan, not replace them)
5. **Transparent progress** (you see what we're building)

## The Vision

**Today:** ~$700-800k revenue trending to $1.2M-$1.7M, owner-operator model, Kelsey is the bottleneck
**After Phase 2:** Infrastructure to scale to $6M without breaking

**The Question:** What's it worth to get to Pinetop with a business that runs without you?

**The Answer:** $15,000-$47,000 for an estimated $25,000-$160,000/year in ROI (choose the tier that fits -- validation narrows the range before you commit to the build)
