# Email to Megan: Interview Scheduling

**To:** Megan
**CC:** Kelsey, Nikki
**Subject:** Quick Check-In on Ply + Phase 2 Planning (30-45 Min)

---

Hi Megan,

We're putting together Phase 2 for Plotter Mechanix and want to make sure we **support what you're building** with Ply (not replace it or duplicate work).

## What We Need

**30-45 minute interview** to understand:
1. Where you are with Ply implementation
2. What Ply does well (so we don't rebuild it)
3. What gaps Ply doesn't cover (so we can fill them)
4. Where we can help without stepping on your toes

## Topics We'll Cover

### Ply Implementation Status
- How far along are you? (% complete)
- What's working well?
- What's been challenging?
- Timeline to full rollout?

### Technical Capabilities
- Does Ply have an API we can integrate with?
- What does Ply's Jobber integration include?
- How does inventory search work?
- Can Ply track used parts from parted-out machines?

### Collaboration Opportunities
- What would make YOUR life easier with Ply?
- Where could we help without duplicating your work?
- What printer-specific configuration do you need?

### Used Parts Inventory
- How much used parts inventory exists? (~$50k estimate?)
- How are used parts currently tracked?
- Could Ply handle this or does it need custom solution?

## Why This Matters

We want to build systems that **enhance** what you've already done, not redo it. For example:
- **If Ply has an API** → We'll build a chat agent that queries Ply (adds value, doesn't replace)
- **If Ply doesn't track equipment history** → We'll build Equipment CRM (fills gap)
- **If Ply needs help with setup** → We can assist with printer-specific config

Your insights help us avoid the "2-3 vendors who took money and delivered nothing" problem.

## Scheduling

**When works for you?**
- [ ] This week: [suggest 2-3 time slots]
- [ ] Next week: [suggest 2-3 time slots]
- [ ] I'll send you my calendar link

**Format:**
- [ ] Video call (Zoom/Meet)
- [ ] Phone call
- [ ] In-person at shop

We'll record notes (not audio) and share a summary afterward so everyone's on the same page.

## What You'll Get Out of This

- Clarity on how Phase 2 supports (not conflicts with) your Ply work
- Potential help with Ply configuration if needed
- Input on Phase 2 priorities (your voice matters)

Looking forward to collaborating!
