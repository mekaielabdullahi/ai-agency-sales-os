## Questions for Otto

### 1. ROI Validation Questions

**Ask Otto:** "How do we position these numbers to make them bulletproof?"

| Data Point | Current Value | Question for Otto |
|------------|---------------|-------------------|
| Alyssa's hourly cost | $20-30/hr (estimate) | "Should we get the exact rate or is a range acceptable?" |
| Kelsey's effective rate | $300-375/hr | "Is opportunity cost the right framing for a technician-owner?" |
| Annual savings | $67-83K | "Is this range compelling or should we narrow it?" |
| Training cost per tech | $21-35K | "How do we quantify 'knowledge in his head' value?" |

---

### 2. Pricing Structure Questions

**The Core Question:** "What's the right pricing model for a $15K budget with a service business owner?"

**Option A: Milestone-Based**
- $10K Milestone 1: Email + Jobber fixes (Month 1)
- $5K Milestone 2: Training system (Month 2)
- $5K Milestone 3: Inventory + polish (Month 3)
- **Total:** $20K over 3 months

**Option B: Tiered Packages**
- Foundation: $15K (operations fix)
- Growth: $28K (add training)
- Full Scale: $42K (complete transformation)

**Option C: Value-Based**
- Price as % of first-year savings
- $67-83K savings → $15-20K investment (18-24%)
- "You're paying $1 to get $4-5 back"

**Ask Otto:** "Which framing works best for a busy owner who's been burned before?"

---

### 3. Terms & Structure Questions

| Question | Context |
|----------|---------|
| "Net 30 or milestone payment?" | Cash flow for small business |
| "Deposit required?" | We're not Malik - build trust |
| "What if they want to start smaller?" | Foundation tier as entry point |
| "How do we handle scope creep?" | Clear boundaries upfront |

---

### 4. Pitch Strategy Questions

**The Kelsey Profile:**
- Technician-owner, 25 years experience
- Burned by previous consultant (Malik - word salad, no delivery)
- Vision: "Pine Top cabin, just make phone calls and get paid"
- Hiring 2 techs this month (training burden is acute)
- Wife Nikki handles books, may be in decision

**Ask Otto:**
1. "How do we position against the Malik experience?"
2. "Should we lead with email crisis or training burden?"
3. "Is the 'consultant vs. technician' transformation too abstract?"
4. "How do we create urgency without pressure?"

## Talking Points for Otto

### The Phase 1 Story
> "We did $5K, delivered in 30 days, and the system is live. Quo is capturing calls, creating Requests in Jobber automatically. The trust is building. Now we've discovered the real opportunity."

### The Discovery
> "Alyssa spends 50% of her time - half her work week - managing 10 email inboxes. That's not email, that's running the entire operation through fragmented channels. We can fix that."

### The Training Burden
> "Joe told us it takes 120-200 hours of Kelsey's time to train a new tech. They're hiring 2 techs this month. That's 400 hours of Kelsey's time - worth $70K at his rate. The training system alone pays for Phase 2."

### The Math
> "Phase 1: $5K investment, $70K+ annual value. Phase 2: $10-15K investment, $67-83K annual value. 2-3 month payback. The ROI is overwhelming."

### The Vision
> "Transform Kelsey from a technician who owns a business to a consultant who owns a knowledge platform. Get paid for his brain, not just his hands."

## Otto's Likely Questions

| Anticipated Question | Prepared Answer |
|---------------------|-----------------|
| "What's the competitive landscape?" | No direct competitors for this integrated approach. Jobber consultants exist but don't do AI/automation. |
| "Why haven't they done this themselves?" | They don't know what they don't know. Kelsey's busy doing service calls. |
| "What's the risk?" | We've already proven delivery with Phase 1. Milestone-based de-risks for client. |
| "Can they afford $15-20K?" | They're projecting $1.2-1.7M revenue. This is 1% of revenue for 5%+ efficiency gain. |
| "What if they say no?" | Start with Foundation tier ($15K) or quick wins only. Land and expand. |
