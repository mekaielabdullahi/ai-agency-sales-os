# Phase 2 ROI Validation Action Plan

**Created:** January 24, 2026
**Owner:** Matthew Kerns + Team
**Timeline:** 2-3 weeks before Phase 2 start
**Purpose:** Replace assumptions with validated data from Plotter Mechanix

---

## Executive Summary

**Current State:** ROI calculations based on ~70% assumptions, 30% data
**Goal:** 80%+ of ROI variables validated with real data before Phase 2 starts
**Timeline:** Week 1-2 (data collection), Week 3 (analysis & presentation)

**Why This Matters:**
> "We need to work from business problems with validated time spent by employees → process improvement → solutions development" - User guidance

**Success Criteria:**
- Can defend every dollar of $47k investment with data
- Client says "This makes sense" not "This seems high"
- ROI ratio stays >2.5:1 even with conservative real data

## What We're Validating

### High Priority (Must Validate Before Phase 2)

| Variable | Current Assumption | Confidence | Method | Owner |
|----------|-------------------|------------|--------|-------|
| **Kelsey's training time** | 5 hrs/week | 🔴 LOW | 5-day time tracking | Kelsey |
| **Alyssa's "Do we have X?" interruptions** | 10/day × 5 min | 🔴 LOW | 5-day tally log | Alyssa |
| **Alyssa's email processing time** | Unknown | 🔴 LOW | 5-day time tracking | Alyssa |
| **Alyssa's context-switching time** | Unknown | 🔴 LOW | 5-day tracking | Alyssa |
| **Business annual revenue** | $600k estimate | 🔴 LOW | Financial records | Kelsey/Nikki |
| **Service contract eligible customers** | 20 estimate | 🔴 LOW | Jobber data analysis | Matthew |
| **Ply implementation status** | Unknown % | 🔴 LOW | Megan interview | Matthew/Linh |
| **Used parts inventory value** | $50k estimate | 🟡 MEDIUM | Megan interview | Matthew/Linh |

### Medium Priority (Should Validate for Stronger Case)

| Variable | Current Assumption | Method | Owner |
|----------|-------------------|--------|-------|
| Customer churn rate | Unknown | Jobber analysis | Matthew |
| Alyssa's manual data entry time | Unknown | 5-day tracking | Alyssa |
| Equipment lookup time | Unknown | 5-day tracking | Alyssa |
| Joe's onboarding timeline | 4-6 weeks estimate | Kelsey interview | Matthew/Chris |

---

## Risk Mitigation

**Risk 1: Time tracking doesn't happen**
**Mitigation:**
- Daily check-ins with Alyssa/Kelsey
- Make templates VERY simple (tally marks ok)
- Offer to track for them if needed (call and review end of day)

**Risk 2: Validated ROI is much lower than estimated**
**Mitigation:**
- Adjust pricing to maintain 2.5:1 ratio
- Reduce scope if needed
- Be transparent: "We overestimated X, here's the adjusted number"

**Risk 3: Megan's Ply covers more than we thought**
**Mitigation:**
- GOOD - less for us to build
- Adjust scope: More chat agent, less Ply enhancements
- Reposition as "chat agent that queries Megan's Ply"

**Risk 4: Andrew doesn't want/need tools**
**Mitigation:**
- Remove supplies-specific features from Phase 2
- Keep it as Phase 3 option if he changes mind
- Reduce price slightly if scope reduced
