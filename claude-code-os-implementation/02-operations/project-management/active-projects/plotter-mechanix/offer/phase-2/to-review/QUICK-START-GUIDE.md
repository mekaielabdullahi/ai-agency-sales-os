## 🔍 INTERNAL REVIEW FIRST (Before Launching Validation)

### What the Team Needs to Review

**Mekaiel, Trent, Chris, and Matthew: Review these 3 core documents**

1. **PHASE-2-PROPOSAL.md** (Client-facing)
   - [ ] Pricing makes sense ($47k for $116,600/year ROI)
   - [ ] 10x scale framework resonates with Plotter's situation
   - [ ] Deliverables are achievable in 4-6 weeks
   - [ ] Technical approach is sound (chat agent, Equipment CRM, etc.)
   - [ ] Supports Megan/Andrew initiatives appropriately
   - [ ] Timeline is realistic

2. **VALIDATION-ACTION-PLAN.md** (Internal process)
   - [ ] Time tracking templates are simple enough for Alyssa/Kelsey
   - [ ] Interview questions will get us the data we need
   - [ ] 2-3 week validation timeline is feasible
   - [ ] We have capacity to analyze data and update proposal
   - [ ] ROI assumptions are reasonable (need validation)

3. **to-send/ emails** (6 templates)
   - [ ] Tone is appropriate (professional but friendly)
   - [ ] Asks are clear and not burdensome
   - [ ] Templates are ready to personalize and send
   - [ ] Timeline expectations are set correctly

### Key Questions to Answer

**Before launching validation phase:**

1. **Capacity**: Do we have 2-3 weeks to run validation before presenting?
2. **Pricing confidence**: Is $47k the right number or should we adjust?
3. **Developer resources**: Who will build Phase 2 if we close at $47k?
4. **Chris filming**: Is Chris available for 25-30 training videos in 4-6 weeks?
5. **Technical feasibility**:
   - Can we build chat agent with Ply/Quo/Jobber tool access?
   - Is Equipment CRM achievable in timeline?
   - Email automation complexity?
6. **Margin**: What's our cost to deliver $47k scope? (Should target 40-50% margin)

### Internal Review Checklist

- [ ] **Mekaiel** reviews all 3 core documents (pricing strategy, technical approach)
- [ ] **Trent** reviews business case and ROI calculations
- [ ] **Chris** reviews filming/training deliverables for feasibility
- [ ] **Matthew** reviews overall proposal and validation process
- [ ] Team discusses developer capacity (who builds this if we close?)
- [ ] Validate margin (estimate internal cost vs $47k revenue)
- [ ] Confirm we can dedicate 2-3 weeks to validation phase
- [ ] Make any necessary adjustments to pricing/scope/timeline
- [ ] Get team alignment on "go/no-go" before contacting Kelsey

### After Internal Review: Decision Point

**Option 1: Proceed with Validation Phase**
→ Send kickoff email to Kelsey (Step 1 below)
→ Run 2-3 week validation process
→ Present Phase 2 with data-backed ROI

**Option 2: Adjust Before Validation**
→ Revise pricing/scope based on team feedback
→ Update PHASE-2-PROPOSAL.md
→ Then launch validation phase

**Option 3: Defer Phase 2**
→ Not the right time/capacity
→ Focus on other priorities (IDEA Brand Coach, other clients)
→ Revisit in 1-2 months

---

## 🚀 What to Do Next (After Internal Review)

### Step 1: Send Validation Kickoff Email (TODAY)

**Action:** Copy-paste `to-send/01-email-to-kelsey-validation-kickoff.md` and send to Kelsey

**What it does:**
- Explains 2-3 week validation process
- Requests time tracking participation (him + Alyssa)
- Sets expectations for interviews and data requests
- Gets his buy-in before starting

**Expected response:** "Yes, let's do it" or questions about process

---

### Step 2: Send Time Tracking Templates (Once Kelsey Approves)

**Action A:** Send `to-send/02-alyssa-time-tracking-template.md` to Alyssa
**Subject:** "Quick Time Tracking for Phase 2 Planning (5 Days, 2 Min/Day)"

**Action B:** Send `to-send/03-kelsey-time-tracking-template.md` to Kelsey
**Subject:** "Track Training Time This Week (Validates Training System ROI)"

**Timeline:** Ask them to start Monday of next full work week (5 consecutive days)

**Follow-up:** Check in mid-week to see if they're tracking (text or call)

---

### Step 3: Schedule Interviews (This Week)

**Action A:** Send `to-send/04-megan-interview-scheduling.md` to Megan (CC Kelsey/Nikki)
**Goal:** 30-45 min interview about Ply status, API, gaps, collaboration

**Action B:** Send `to-send/05-andrew-interview-scheduling.md` to Andrew (CC Kelsey)
**Goal:** 30 min interview about supplies process, vision, tools needed

**Timeline:** Schedule for Week 1 or early Week 2 (before time tracking data comes in)

**Prep:** Review VALIDATION-ACTION-PLAN.md interview guides before each call

---

### Step 4: Request Jobber Data Export (This Week)

**Action:** Send `to-send/06-jobber-data-request.md` to Kelsey

**Goal:** Get Jobber export of customers, jobs, invoices (last 12 months)

**Timeline:** Ideally this week so you can analyze before Week 3 presentation

**Follow-up:** If Kelsey struggles with export, offer to help or request read-only access

---

### Step 5: Conduct Interviews (Week 1-2)

**Megan Interview:**
- Use questions from VALIDATION-ACTION-PLAN.md (Ply section)
- Focus: API capabilities, gaps, where to help, used parts value
- Document: Take detailed notes, share summary with Megan/Kelsey afterward

**Andrew Interview:**
- Use questions from VALIDATION-ACTION-PLAN.md (Andrew section)
- Focus: Supplies process, vision, tools that fit his workflow
- Document: Take notes, identify if/where Phase 2 can support

**Optional:** Interview Kelsey and Alyssa if time allows (questions in VALIDATION-ACTION-PLAN.md)

---

### Step 6: Collect & Analyze Data (Week 2)

**When time tracking ends (Friday of Week 1):**
- [ ] Request completed tracking forms from Alyssa and Kelsey
- [ ] Compile data into summary (see VALIDATION-ACTION-PLAN.md templates)
- [ ] Calculate actual time spent vs. estimates

**Jobber data analysis:**
- [ ] Import Jobber CSV into spreadsheet
- [ ] Analyze: service contract candidates, churn, equipment types, revenue
- [ ] Use templates in VALIDATION-ACTION-PLAN.md

**Interview insights:**
- [ ] Review Megan interview notes → adjust Ply integration scope
- [ ] Review Andrew interview notes → adjust or remove supplies deliverables
- [ ] Identify any new gaps or opportunities

---

### Step 7: Compile Validation Report (End of Week 2)

**Action:** Create validation summary document (use template in VALIDATION-ACTION-PLAN.md)

**Include:**
- Time tracking results (Alyssa's 5 activities, Kelsey's training time)
- Jobber analysis (contracts, revenue, equipment)
- Interview insights (Megan, Andrew)
- Updated ROI calculations (replace assumptions with validated data)
- Pricing adjustment recommendation (if needed)

**Decision Point:** Does validated ROI support $47k price?
- **Yes:** Proceed with PHASE-2-PROPOSAL.md as-is
- **No:** Adjust price or scope to maintain 2.5:1+ value-to-price ratio

---

### Step 8: Update Proposal (Week 3)

**If validation shows adjustments needed:**
- [ ] Update PHASE-2-PROPOSAL.md with validated numbers
- [ ] Adjust deliverables if Megan/Andrew insights require it
- [ ] Recalculate pricing if ROI changed significantly

**If validation confirms estimates:**
- [ ] Add validation data to proposal (strengthens credibility)
- [ ] No pricing changes needed

---

### Step 9: Present Phase 2 (Week 3-4)

**Action:** Schedule presentation meeting with Kelsey, Nikki, Megan

**Agenda:**
1. **Validation results** (10 min) - "Here's what we measured in YOUR business"
2. **ROI breakdown** (10 min) - "Here's what it's worth to you"
3. **Proposal walkthrough** (15 min) - PHASE-2-PROPOSAL.md
4. **Q&A** (15 min)
5. **Next steps** (5 min) - Sign contract, 50% deposit, start Week 1

**Materials:**
- Share PHASE-2-PROPOSAL.md beforehand (let them review)
- Present validation report (builds confidence)
- Have pricing breakdown ready (PRICING-BREAKDOWN.md from phase-2 folder)

**Objection handling:**
- "Too expensive" → Show 3.3:1 value-to-price ratio, 4.8 month payback
- "Not sure it will work" → Show validated data from THEIR business
- "Can we do less?" → Offer phased approach (Phase 2A + 2B split)

---

### Step 10: Close & Deliver (Week 4+)

**If they say yes:**
- [ ] Send contract (SOW based on PHASE-2-PROPOSAL.md deliverables)
- [ ] Collect 50% deposit ($23,500)
- [ ] Kick off Phase 2 delivery (Week 1-6 timeline in proposal)

**If they need time:**
- [ ] Set follow-up date (1 week)
- [ ] Address any concerns
- [ ] Offer to adjust scope if needed

## 🔥 What Could Go Wrong (And How to Handle It)

### Problem 1: Kelsey/Alyssa Don't Track Time
**Mitigation:**
- Simplify templates (fewer fields)
- Offer to text/call daily for verbal estimates
- Track just 2-3 days instead of 5

### Problem 2: Validated ROI Much Lower Than Estimated
**Mitigation:**
- Reduce price to maintain 2.5:1 ratio
- OR reduce scope (modular approach)
- OR focus on highest-ROI deliverables only

### Problem 3: Megan/Andrew Don't Want to Collaborate
**Mitigation:**
- Reduce or remove their deliverables
- Focus on independent systems (training, Equipment CRM)
- Adjust pricing accordingly

### Problem 4: Jobber Data Export Fails
**Mitigation:**
- Work with partial data (top 50 customers)
- Manual data collection (Kelsey provides summary)
- Use conservative estimates, disclose assumptions

### Problem 5: Budget Ceiling Lower Than $47k
**Mitigation:**
- Offer Phase 2A ($23k) + Phase 2B ($24k) split
- Modular approach (choose top 3 deliverables)
- Payment plan (3-4 monthly installments)

## 📞 Questions?

- **"What if Kelsey says no to validation?"** → Pivot to presenting Phase 2 with assumptions (riskier, but possible)
- **"What if validation shows $47k is too high?"** → Adjust price or scope to maintain 2.5:1 ratio
- **"What if I don't get all the data?"** → Work with what you have, disclose assumptions in proposal
- **"What if Megan/Andrew won't interview?"** → Proceed without their input, adjust deliverables conservatively
