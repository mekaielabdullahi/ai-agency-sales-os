# Kelsey's Time Tracking Template (5 Days)

**Purpose:** Measure how much time you spend training Joe so we can calculate ROI for the training system
**Duration:** 5 business days (1 work week)
**Time Required:** ~1 minute at end of each day
**Why:** Validates the value of having training videos so Joe (and future techs like Steve) can learn without taking your time

- Direct instruction (showing him how to do something)
- Answering his questions
- Reviewing his work and giving feedback
- Riding along on service calls to teach him

**Don't include:** Time Joe spends working independently (that's productive time)

## How to Submit

**Option 1:** Fill out daily and send to matthew@arisegroup.ai at end of Week 1
**Option 2:** Keep notes and we'll review together during your interview
**Option 3:** Text/call daily estimates to Matthew (480-xxx-xxxx) if easier

This data helps us prove the training system ROI. If you're spending 5 hrs/week training and we can cut that to 2 hrs/week, that's $39k/year in recovered time you can spend on higher-value work.
