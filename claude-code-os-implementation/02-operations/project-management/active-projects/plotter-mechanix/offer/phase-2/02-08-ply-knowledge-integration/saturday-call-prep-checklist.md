## Call Agenda (Draft)

### 1. Opening (5 min)

**Context Setting:**
- "We've been deep-diving into Ply's capabilities since the last call."
- "Good news: Ply is MORE capable than we initially thought."
- "We've revised the Phase 2 scope to avoid duplicating what Ply already does and focus on the real gaps."

**Goals for this call:**
- Present revised Phase 2 scope and pricing
- Show ROI projections
- Get buy-in to move forward

---

### 2. Ply Capabilities Overview (5-7 min)

**What Ply Already Has (Native Features):**
- ✅ Jobber integration (bidirectional, real-time)
- ✅ QuickBooks integration (A/R, A/P sync)
- ✅ Supplier integrations (3,000+ branches, 3M products)
- ✅ Mobile apps with barcode scanning
- ✅ Tools tracking for serialized equipment
- ✅ Auto-replenishment logic
- ✅ Transfer management between locations

**Key Message:** *"Ply has the foundation. We don't need to rebuild what they already provide."*

---

### 3. The Real Gap: Quo ↔ Ply Integration (10 min)

**The Problem:**
- When Kelsey/Andrew are on a Quo call, they can't see Ply inventory data
- Customer asks: "Do you have HP 730 ink?"
- Current process: (Kelsey to describe - ask on call)
  - Call warehouse? Check spreadsheet? Guess?
- Result: Slow response, potential errors, lost sales

**The Solution:**
- Chat agent that queries Ply inventory in real-time
- "Do we have HP 730 ink?" → Chat agent → Ply API → Instant answer
- Works during Quo call - no context switching
- Shows: Quantity, location (warehouse vs. truck), pricing

**Value:**
- Faster quotes (seconds vs. minutes)
- Accurate inventory data (no more guessing)
- Better customer experience (confident answers)
- Increased sales (say yes when you have stock, upsell when you have related parts)

---

### 4. Revised Phase 2 Scope & Pricing (10-15 min)

**Present Scenario A/B/C Based on Megan Interview:**

*(Example: Mid-Range Scenario $8K - adjust based on actual findings)*

**Deliverables:**
1. **Complete Ply Implementation** ($3K)
   - Team training on Ply features
   - Configure used parts tracking (via Ply's Tools feature)
   - Set up barcode workflow
   - Process adoption support

2. **Quo ↔ Ply Chat Agent Integration** ($5K)
   - Build API integration layer (Quo ↔ Ply)
   - Create chat agent for real-time inventory lookups
   - Train Kelsey/Andrew on using chat agent
   - 2-3 iterations based on feedback

**Total: $8,000**

**Timeline:** 3-4 weeks
- Week 1: Ply configuration and team training
- Week 2-3: Build Quo ↔ Ply integration
- Week 4: Testing, refinement, final training

---

### 5. ROI Justification (5-7 min)

**Ply's Case Study: $3M Contractor**
- Material spend reduced by 2% (22% → 20%)
- Annual savings: $60K (material optimization)
- Additional savings: $15-20K (eliminated rush orders, reduced tech time)
- **Total: $75-80K/year**

**Plotter Mechanix Projections:**
- Current revenue: ~$700-800K/year
- Material spend: ~22% (~$154-176K/year)
- **2% improvement = $14-16K/year savings**
- Additional savings (tech time, emergency purchases): $5-9K/year
- **Total: $19-25K/year**

**Payback Period:**
- Investment: $8K (one-time)
- Annual savings: $19-25K
- **Payback: 3-5 months**

**5-Year ROI:**
- Investment: $8K
- 5-year savings: $95-125K
- **ROI: 1,088-1,462%**

---

### 6. Questions & Discussion (10-15 min)

**Questions to Ask Kelsey:**

1. **Validate the problem:**
   - "When you're on a Quo call and a customer asks 'Do you have X?', what's your current process?"
   - "How often does this happen per day/week?"
   - "Have you ever quoted a part you didn't have, or said you didn't have a part that was actually in stock?"

2. **Validate the solution:**
   - "Would a chat agent that instantly queries Ply solve this problem?"
   - "What information do you need to see? Just quantity? Location? Pricing?"
   - "Any other integrations or features that would make this more valuable?"

3. **Get buy-in:**
   - "Does this revised scope make sense?"
   - "Is the $8K pricing in line with your expectations?"
   - "Are you ready to move forward with Phase 2?"

---

### 7. Next Steps & Close (5 min)

**If Kelsey Approves:**
- [ ] Send updated proposal for signature
- [ ] Schedule Phase 2 kickoff meeting (Megan, Kelsey, our team)
- [ ] Get Ply API access credentials from Megan
- [ ] Start Week 1: Ply configuration and team training

**If Kelsey Has Concerns:**
- [ ] Document concerns and objections
- [ ] Agree on path forward (more research? Different scope?)
- [ ] Schedule follow-up call if needed

**If Kelsey Needs to Think About It:**
- [ ] Set deadline for decision (e.g., end of week)
- [ ] Provide any additional info requested
- [ ] Follow up on deadline date

---

## Talking Points Reference

### Opening Hook
*"We've been studying Ply's platform in depth, and I have good news: it's MORE powerful than we initially realized. This means we can deliver more value at a better price by focusing on the real gaps instead of rebuilding features Ply already has."*

---

### Positioning Our Value
*"Ply provides the foundation - inventory tracking, barcode scanning, supplier integrations. We're completing that foundation and building the bridge to Quo, which is where Kelsey and Andrew feel the pain every day during customer calls."*

---

### Handling Objections

**Objection: "Why didn't you know this before?"**
- Response: "Great question. We initially scoped based on high-level requirements. Now that we've deep-dived into Ply's 19-page integration deck and planned to interview Megan, we have a much clearer picture. This actually SAVES you money because we're not rebuilding what Ply already provides."

**Objection: "$8K seems high for just a chat agent."**
- Response: "It's not just the chat agent. We're also completing Megan's Ply implementation - team training, used parts workflow, barcode setup, process adoption. The chat agent is the centerpiece, but we're ensuring the whole system works seamlessly."

**Objection: "Can't we just use Ply's features without your help?"**
- Response: "You absolutely can. But based on our research, most businesses don't fully adopt Ply without implementation support. Ply offers a $5K warehouse audit service for exactly this reason. Our $8K includes that implementation support PLUS the Quo ↔ Ply integration, which Ply can't do for you."

**Objection: "What if we just want the Quo integration, not the Ply implementation?"**
- Response: "We can absolutely scope it that way. If Megan's Ply implementation is already solid, we can reduce the scope to $5K for just the Quo ↔ Ply chat agent. That's why we want to interview Megan first - to avoid charging you for work that's already done."

---

### Closing Push
*"The ROI here is undeniable. If you achieve even HALF of what Ply's case study showed - a 1% material spend improvement - you're looking at $7-8K in annual savings. This investment pays for itself in less than a year, and then you're saving $20K+ every year after that."*
