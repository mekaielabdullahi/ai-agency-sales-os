## The 3 Scenarios (Based on Megan's Answers)

### Scenario A: Ply NOT Purchased ($13K)
**If:** Megan hasn't purchased Ply's $5K warehouse audit service

**Scope:**
- Recommend Ply's $5K warehouse audit service (1-3 trucks, 4-week onboarding)
- Build Quo ↔ Ply chat agent integration ($8K)
- **Total: $13K**

**Timeline:** 6-7 weeks (4 weeks Ply + 2-3 weeks us)

---

### Scenario B: Ply Fully Implemented ($5K)
**If:** Megan already purchased and completed Ply's warehouse audit service

**Scope:**
- Build Quo ↔ Ply chat agent integration ONLY ($5K)
- **Total: $5K**

**Timeline:** 2-3 weeks

---

### Scenario C: Ply Partially Implemented ($8K) - MOST LIKELY
**If:** Ply is purchased but not fully adopted/configured

**Scope:**
- Complete Ply implementation (training, barcode workflow, used parts setup) - $3K
- Build Quo ↔ Ply chat agent integration - $5K
- **Total: $8K**

**Timeline:** 3-4 weeks

---

## Top 3 Megan Interview Questions (Must-Answer)

### 1. Did you purchase Ply's warehouse audit/implementation service ($5K+)?
- **If YES:** Scenario B or C (depends on completion status)
- **If NO:** Scenario A (recommend Ply's service + our integration)

### 2. Is the Jobber ↔ Ply material sync currently ACTIVE?
- **If YES:** Remove from scope (native feature, $0 cost)
- **If NO:** Investigate why (configuration issue, not custom build)

### 3. How are used parts tracked today?
- **If using Ply's Tools feature:** Remove from scope ($0)
- **If manual (spreadsheets):** Configure Tools feature ($2-3K)
- **If not tracked:** Design workflow + configure ($3-5K)

## What Makes This Different from Original Scope?

### BEFORE (Original $8K Scope)
- Build Jobber ↔ Ply integration (custom)
- Build used parts tracking system (custom)
- Build Quo ↔ Ply integration (custom)

### AFTER (Revised Scope - Based on Ply Deck)
- ~~Build Jobber ↔ Ply~~ → Already native, just activate/configure
- ~~Build used parts tracking~~ → Use Ply's native Tools feature
- ✅ Build Quo ↔ Ply chat agent → **REAL GAP, UNIQUE VALUE**

### Why This is Better
- **Avoid duplicating work** - Ply already has most features
- **Focus on real value** - Quo ↔ Ply gap is the actual pain point
- **Faster delivery** - Leverage Ply's foundation instead of rebuilding
- **Better ROI** - Same outcome, less waste, more impact

---

## Talking Points for Kelsey (Saturday Call)

### Opening Hook
*"We've been studying Ply's platform in depth, and I have good news: it's MORE powerful than we initially realized. This means we can deliver more value at a better price by focusing on the real gaps instead of rebuilding features Ply already has."*

### Positioning Our Value
*"Ply provides the foundation - inventory tracking, barcode scanning, supplier integrations. We're completing that foundation and building the bridge to Quo, which is where Kelsey and Andrew feel the pain every day during customer calls."*

### The Real Problem
*"When you're on a Quo call and a customer asks 'Do you have HP 730 ink?', what happens today? You can't see Ply's inventory data. Our chat agent solves this - instant, real-time inventory lookups during Quo calls. No more guessing, no more lost sales."*

### ROI Close
*"The ROI here is undeniable. Even a 1% material spend improvement saves you $7-8K/year. This investment pays for itself in under a year, and then you're saving $20K+ every year after that."*

  - **Response:** Show ROI (3-5 month payback), offer phased approach

- **Megan has fully implemented Ply (Scenario B)**
  - **Impact:** Scope drops to $5K (Quo integration only)
