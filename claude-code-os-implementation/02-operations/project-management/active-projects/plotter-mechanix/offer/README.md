## Pricing Philosophy (AAA Framework)

**From Liam's *Pricing Perfection*:**
- Target value-to-price ratio: **2.5:1** (client gets $2.50 per $1 invested)
- Formula: Year 1 Value ÷ 2.5 = Recommended Price

**Our Phase 2 Pricing:**
- Year 1 Value: $153,600
- AAA Formula: $153,600 ÷ 2.5 = $61,440
- Our Price: **$45,000** (27% discount for vendor fatigue + adoption risk)
- Value-to-Price Ratio: **3.4:1** (exceeds target)

**Client ROI:**
- Investment: $45,000
- Year 1 Return: $153,600
- ROI: **241%**
- Payback: **10-12 weeks**

## Risk Factors & Mitigation

### Risk 1: Vendor Fatigue
**Context:** "2-3 companies, lot of money, no results" - Megan

**Mitigation:**
- Prove Phase 1 value before presenting Phase 2 (Quo-Jobber integration working)
- Data-driven ROI (use THEIR numbers, not estimates)
- 30-day review checkpoints
- Transparent progress tracking

---

### Risk 2: Behavioral Adoption
**Context:** "His process needs to be more uniform. Everything he does, but it's not." - Megan

**Mitigation:**
- Design systems that work even if Kelsey doesn't change (Equipment CRM is passive)
- Price discounted 27% to account for this risk
- Work with Megan as accountability partner
- Don't guarantee adoption, guarantee technical deliverables

---

### Risk 3: Budget Constraints
**Context:** Unknown budget ceiling

**Mitigation:**
- Validate budget before presenting ($45k target)
- Phased payment option (Phase 2A: $22k, Phase 2B: $23k)
- Negotiation room down to $38k-40k
- ROI justification backs every dollar

---

### Phase 2 Complete ✅
- All 5 deliverables working
