# Plotter Mechanix - Task Reconciliation Report

**Generated:** 2026-01-11 14:15:00
**Purpose:** Identify gaps between local context and Notion tasks

---

## Executive Summary

| Metric | Count |
|--------|-------|
| Local action items | ~40+ |
| Notion tasks | 19 |
| Notion tasks aligned with current direction | ~6 |
| Missing from Notion | ~25+ |
| Potentially stale in Notion | ~10 |

**Critical Finding:** Dec 29 pivot to Inventory Management is not reflected in Notion. Most Notion tasks are from pre-pivot focus (Communication Hub, proposals).

---

## Current Direction (Source of Truth)

From `P0-ACTIVE-NOW.md` (Dec 29, 2025):

> **PIVOT:** Focus shifted from Communication Hub to **Inventory Management System**
>
> **Current Phase:** Discovery - Baseline Metrics Collection
>
> **Key Principle:** Find the highest ROI opportunity BEFORE building any software.

## Recommended Actions

### Immediate (Today)

1. **Mark as stale/archive** tasks that are pre-contract work now completed
2. **Create 5 new tasks** for Phase 0 Discovery focus:
   - Chris stakeholder meetings
   - Capture baseline hours
   - Capture baseline dollars
   - Document pain points
   - Identify highest-ROI opportunity

### This Week

3. **Create tasks** for Jan 5 PRD open questions (8 items)
4. **Create tasks** for Phase 1 deliverable checklist items (~15 items)

### Structural

5. **Add Use Case relation** to Tasks database to link tasks to UC-1, UC-2, UC-3
6. **Update project description** in Notion to reflect Inventory Management focus

## Summary

The Notion tasks are largely from the **proposal/onboarding phase** (completed Dec 22). The project has since pivoted to **Inventory Management discovery** but Notion hasn't been updated to reflect this.

**Key gap:** The 5 most important tasks (Phase 0 Discovery) don't exist in Notion at all.
