# P0: Plotter Mechanix - ACTIVE NOW

**Status:** Discovery Phase - Inventory Management Focus
**Last Updated:** 2025-12-29
**Priority:** P0 - HIGHEST (First Chris project, strategic importance)
**Health:** 🟢 Green

---

## LATEST UPDATE (Dec 29)

**New Direction:** Focus on **Inventory Management System**
- Chris met with Kelsey and Nikki (his wife)
- They want to focus on inventory management setup
- Chris meeting with key stakeholders this week to gather requirements

**Key Approach:**
1. Pull baseline numbers (hours + dollars into specific operations today)
2. Establish baseline metrics for current state
3. Build out case study with real numbers
4. Find highest ROI opportunity BEFORE building any software

**Open Questions List:** Chris has initial open questions for stakeholder meetings

---

## STRATEGIC CONTEXT

**WHY THIS IS P0:**
- First project from Chris (high-value partner with extensive leads)
- Chris = bulk of agency revenue generation (stated explicitly)
- Success here unlocks entire pipeline of future Chris-sourced deals
- Must execute flawlessly to prove capability and build trust

**OBJECTIVE:** Identify highest-ROI automation opportunity for Plotter Mechanix, starting with inventory management, validated by baseline metrics.

## CURRENT PHASE: Discovery - Baseline Metrics & Inventory Focus

### Development Plan
📄 **[DEVELOPMENT-PLAN.md](../planning/DEVELOPMENT-PLAN.md)** - Full technical strategy

---

## TOP PRIORITY: Baseline Metrics Collection

### What We Have
- [x] Direction from Kelsey & Nikki: Inventory Management
- [x] Chris meeting with stakeholders this week
- [x] Open questions list prepared for stakeholder meetings
- [x] Jobber API key access (for later phases)

### What We're Doing NOW

**Phase 0: Discovery & Baseline**
1. [ ] Chris stakeholder meetings (this week)
2. [ ] Capture baseline hours spent on inventory operations
3. [ ] Capture baseline dollars spent on inventory operations
4. [ ] Document current inventory workflow pain points
5. [ ] Identify highest-ROI automation opportunity

**Key Principle:** Find the highest ROI opportunity BEFORE building any software.

---

## IMMEDIATE NEXT STEPS

### This Week (Priority Order)

#### 1. Stakeholder Discovery (Chris)
- [ ] Meet with key stakeholders at Plotter Mechanix
- [ ] Ask open questions from prepared list
- [ ] Get baseline numbers: hours/week on inventory tasks
- [ ] Get baseline numbers: dollars/month on inventory operations
- [ ] Document current workflow and pain points

#### 2. ROI Analysis
- [ ] Calculate potential time savings
- [ ] Calculate potential cost savings
- [ ] Identify quick wins vs. long-term solutions
- [ ] Prioritize based on effort vs. impact

#### 3. Case Study Foundation
- [ ] Document current state with real numbers
- [ ] Define success metrics for after implementation
- [ ] Create before/after framework for case study

#### 4. Technical Preparation (Background)
- [ ] Research inventory management in Jobber
- [ ] Research Quo inventory capabilities
- [ ] Identify what's already possible with existing tools

## WORKFLOW ANALYSIS OBJECTIVES

Once Jobber data is in our database, analyze:

1. **Who makes updates?**
   - Team member activity patterns
   - Role-based breakdown (Kelce, Alyssa, Joe)

2. **How are updates made?**
   - Types of records created/modified
   - Manual vs automated workflows

3. **When are updates made?**
   - Time patterns
   - Peak activity windows
   - Response time analysis

4. **How often are updates made?**
   - Transaction volume
   - Change frequency

**Deliverable:** Current state workflow map → Foundation for optimization

## PATH TO VALUE DELIVERY

```
1. Jobber API Integration (NOW)
   ↓
2. Data Ingestion & Backup System
   ↓
3. Workflow Analysis (who/how/when/how often)
   ↓
4. Quo + Jobber Capability Research
   ↓
5. Business Analyst Agent Validation
   ↓
6. PRD Development (current state → optimized state)
   ↓
7. Workflow Optimization Implementation
   ↓
8. AI Tool Utilization (Jobber + Quo built-in features)
```

---

## SUCCESS CRITERIA

### Phase 0 (Data Foundation)
- [ ] Jobber data fully ingested in our database
- [ ] Backup system operational
- [ ] Incremental sync working
- [ ] No access to modify their live systems (confirmed)

### Phase 1 (Workflow Analysis)
- [ ] Complete workflow map created
- [ ] Pain points documented
- [ ] Activity patterns analyzed
- [ ] Bottlenecks identified

### Phase 2 (BA Agent + PRD)
- [ ] Business Analyst agent analysis complete
- [ ] PRD approved
- [ ] Implementation roadmap finalized
- [ ] Build right thing validated

### Final State
- [ ] Optimized workflow deployed
- [ ] AI tools in Jobber fully utilized
- [ ] AI tools in Quo fully utilized
- [ ] Measurable time savings achieved
- [ ] Client satisfaction confirmed

---

## DEPENDENCIES

**What We Have:**
- [x] Jobber API key access
- [x] Client buy-in on approach
- [x] Team aligned on goals

**What We Need:**
- [ ] Database infrastructure setup
- [ ] N8N instance configured
- [ ] Quo account access (for integration)
- [ ] Previous brainstorming session notes compiled

## RISKS & MITIGATION

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|
| API limitations | Medium | Research docs first, understand capabilities |
| Data volume | Low | Incremental sync, pagination |
| Integration complexity | Medium | Start simple, iterate |
| Scope creep | High | BA agent validates before we build |

---

## KEY PRINCIPLES

1. **Data Safety First** - Never modify client's live systems
2. **Understand Before Optimize** - Complete workflow analysis first
3. **Build Right Thing First** - BA agent validates before building
4. **Leverage Existing AI** - Use Jobber/Quo built-in features before custom

---

## COMMUNICATION PLAN

### With Client (Kelce/Alyssa):
- Frequency: Weekly updates
- Method: Via Chris
- Focus: Progress, no disruption to their systems

### With Chris:
- Frequency: Regular updates
- Method: Slack/Call
- Updates: Progress, milestones, wins

---

## NOTES

**Why this approach matters:**
- We're not building blindly - we understand their workflow first
- We have real data to analyze, not assumptions
- Business Analyst agent validates our direction
- We build the RIGHT thing, not just A thing
- AI tools already in Jobber/Quo may solve much of the problem

**Key Reminder:**
This is Chris's first project. Execute with excellence to unlock the entire pipeline.

**Next Update:** After Jobber API connection established
