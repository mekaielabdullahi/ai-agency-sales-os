## Team Notes

**Key Insight:** The email burden was severely underestimated in Phase 1 discovery. Alyssa spending 50% of her time on email management across 10 inboxes is the #1 opportunity for automation ROI.

**Recommendation:** Lead with email unification in Phase 2 proposal - it's the clearest win with fastest payback.
