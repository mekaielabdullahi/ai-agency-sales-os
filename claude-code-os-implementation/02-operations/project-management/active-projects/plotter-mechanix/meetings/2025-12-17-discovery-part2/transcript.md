So now I'm supporting other dealers, which allows me to sell any brand of product. People come to me like I'm a consultant now, you know, like they respect me. I sell used equipment when it's applicable for, you know, whatever the situation is. Or if you need this kind of printer, let's go get you a page wide, you know, and we'll get it from Ark because they're the dealer. But even if Ark sold it to them, I'm going to do the install and support it anyways. You know what I mean? So now I'm helping other places. So this is something new. It's kind of always been my business model, but hasn't been like the industry standard. You know, it's always been like, those guys are our competitors and blah, blah, blah. So I'm less of a threat to those guys, too, because I just tell them straight up. I'm not a dealer, bro. Like, you know, I'm not going to go out and steal your clients. I'm not trying to steal your supplies business. I do sell my own brand of things, but not because I'm trying to take your business. It's because I need something to put in the I have and people are buying it anyways. So why don't I sell something that actually works and support it to the customers that want to trust me with that? So that's kind of what I'm trying to develop. So I sell my. So inks at a significantly higher price, then you can go to Amazon and buy the same I'm selling for 50 bucks. I'm selling it for 125 or HP sells it for 175. So I'm like in that sweet spot where, you know, I'm going to come in and basically you start using my inks. I'll do your service. I'll do the whole thing. You know, we sell paper ink and service is really what I make most of my money on. But the problem with services, dude, it's just me. I got another guy that I'm training again, and he's pretty good. So I can send him out on some little jobs. But the stuff I'm getting into is very specialized, you know, like, I mean, I had some lady that makes clocks for a lady a hundred clocks a day. Her printer took a . It's going to cost her a hundred grand to fix that to sell to replace it. 125,000. He's got two of them. One's going to cost. It's got 10 print ads. They're $3,000 a piece. It's $30,000 to get this thing running. I sent my dude that I know because I know everybody in town now. So I'm like, you know what I got? Michael, he showed up on a Saturday, got her up and running through the weekend so she can continue in Christmas and then decide if she's going to buy something. And I'm actually, she found me through Facebook Marketplace, but I'm, and she's been talking to the guy that I work with that sells Rollins. And they're going to send me to training for Rollin, either though I'm not a dealer, so I can help support their customers better. So I'm like, it's really exciting, kind of like, I just, the workload and the confusion of what's going on is just, it's kind of overwhelming, man. Yeah, yeah.

2:30 - Trent Christopher
I, I mean, I, I come from a background where a lot of it is, you know, doing that type of service work as well, but, um, it sounds like you've, you've found your niche and just helping people, right? You have an expertise.

2:45 - Chris Andrade
But there's so many other opportunities I'm getting into, man. Like yesterday I sold, well, in the last couple, like a month or so, I sold a vinyl cutter, graph tech vinyl cutter. I do a lot with PPF, which is paint protection, film and tint in Arizona. I kind of. So when I'm bored, I go out and I hit all those places up because they're easy to find and I find the owners and I've been doing that. So now I've sold like four or five of these big graphtec cutters in the last month. I sold two to one guy and I sold one to, what's that car company called? Locust Motor or something? Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. The, the, the Lotus, not Lotus. There's a car company that makes their cars here in Phoenix. It's a, it's a higher end. Oh, um, local motor. No, no, it's not Tesla. Lucid. Lucid. Lucid. Thank you. We said it at the same time. Yeah. So Lucid Motors. This is what I like. This is what I like to do. So Lucid Motors uses PPG to make all the paint for their cars. Have you heard of PPG there? Yeah. Well, PPG recently purchased the film company that makes films. And so now they have a thing called paint film. 3M has paint protection film, but paint film is basically their paint in a film that you can apply to a car. So Lucid. Currently all their cars are black on the roof and top in the post. It's in the bottom of it's a color. So they run it through the booth two times. They run it once and then they mask and they run it again, which is costing them millions of dollars. So they're going to put paint protection film or paint film on the top post and not have to run it through twice. So they got this cutter. PPG had a cutter over there for some reason. I don't know. They bought one for me. Can you tell me what a cutter is real quick? Oh, it's, it's for cutting films. Like window tint is all cut on a cutter. You just like, you'd say, I a, I've got a 2020 Lexus. I want to wrap the front windshield and the sides and the mirrors with when you just stick the film in there and hit cut and it sizes it up and cuts it all out. And then the guys just peel it off, stick it on a window. And that 's expensive, you know, and paint protection film. Recently, they came out with that. That's like the stuff that keeps the rocks from hitting your car. Like, well, now they have it in colors. So you get orange and purple and green and glitter and it's got like a 10 year warranty. And so they can put it on a car. Well, anyways, so these big pieces of film, they're trying to cut it with this machine behind me here. And I've been working with these things for years, bro. So I know how they work mechanically. I understand what's up. So they were at a point where they're getting ready to write a contract with PPG to just eliminate cutting film altogether because they were getting frustrated. was like, let me do it one more. Let me, let me do this one more time. Let me come out there and just, you guys got to pay me, man. They got me on net 60 terms. I'm like, that , dude. I go, you need to get a credit card and I'll come over there and help you fix this . But I'm not going to just keep coming over there. You spent like $500 in supplies. You owe me like eight grand and I haven't gotten paid . You want me to keep helping you? Like, I already know what's wrong. So I went out there. He got a credit card together. And we cut and punch cut and everything. 140 inch film on a table, dude, like, like butter, man. I was like, Holy . I can't believe I was videotaping it, man. Like after it gets done, you can just grab the film. It cuts it out and then it cuts it out. And then you can literally grab it and hit it like a garden hose and it just rips out of the page down the sheet. And so they're in the cross having a meeting with PPG to have them cut the film for him. I'm like, how do you guys feel about local business and partnering with local business? Cause I want to do your cut. Yeah. Hey, how you doing? Hey, Joe. They make a hundred cars a day. They need 200 cuts a day. Oh my God. So thousand cuts a month, you know, over the course of a year, I just get a couple of machines. I just cut that out and roll it up and give it to them in a package, however they want it. I don't know. But so my ideas are getting bigger and like, I want a contract like that, bro. I love it. You know what I mean? Like specialty. So we own all this equipment. I don't know if you can see in the office. So we, I, so I took a 3d model with that camera and actually created, you know how, when you look at, when you go look at a rental or a house online, you can do the 3d walkthrough. I did that with the shop. It actually came out really cool. Joe's my social media guru. Like he's been making like a few ads for me on that Tik TOK and like, um, and it's been, there's been a significant increase, uh, people finding out there just by like, uh, putting it at, we post all these printers online, like offer up. And Facebook, like. Like I do my inks. I sell them high. I'm like, look, I'm selling this with a warranty. I'll deliver it. I'll train you how to use it, whatever, you know, I'm not going to give it away. Like it works. You know, this isn't something in my garage that's been sitting over there for two years. I got for free at my office. Okay. Can I, can I, can I just take a minute and can I introduce Joe to the team? Like, can you tell us a little bit about how you met Kelsey? Um, well, my name is Joette Cruz. Oh, . My dad. Um, no, but I, I don't know. I think it was kind of destined almost because it, my, I have a printer, uh, HP latex 115 back at home. And I used to work with my dad because he has a small print shop. So that thing broke down and we were looking for someone to fix it. And we came across Kelsey from a mutual friend. We have Arturo. Yeah. It's all word of mouth, dude. Yeah. I don't burn anybody. Then from there, I just came to visit him at the office and then we got. We to know each other a little better, and then we got to work, and here we are now. And he actually has a lot of skills I don't have or don't want, you know, like, he knows how to work with all of the lower-end Chinese equipment, software, all that stuff. I'm like, dude, I'm only working on draft tech, man, but that opens up another angle for us, because before I would just toss that stuff to the side, so, and he knows how to design in Illustrator, Photoshop, he knows how to run all this equipment, so he helps me with like, you know, he has a background in this industry, and he's interested in it and stuff, so I've been kind of like, I've poured out a lot of my energy to a lot of people, dude, over the last five years, and I'm like, tired of pouring it out, so I've known him over a year, like, I went through a kind of a roller coaster right before I met Chris and all this, and he was, I was like, bro, I need some help, man, and so his dad's thing kind of like, lightened up, he got married recently, so he's been over here basically full-time for what, a month now, or two months, or, and we're busy, dude, like, there's just a lot to do every day, you know, right here. We deliver supplies. I just got him, I gave him a car. I heard you were starting to do some ride-alongs with Kelsey and like getting on service calls. Yeah. How do you like that? Yeah, I've been learning a lot. And thankfully, like now we're able to sometimes go our separate ways and then get stuff done faster, twice as fast. I'll go do my own service calls. I mean, I was in Tucson for six and a half hours yesterday. That means like Alyssa's not doing, I mean, she can, she does all the book work stuff, but nothing's getting handled, you know? So he went out and did a couple of service calls, I think yesterday, some deliveries for me. Oh, and he runs the printers too. Cause I, I do some printing for like, uh, local architects and engineers, um, contractors. So they email their plans and he, he's kind of overseeing the printing side of it, running the equipment. don't really run it. question on that. Cause I was paying, that's how I met you, right? When I needed some plans and bought a plot printer from you. And on average, we were spending about $60 on average to drop us or get a set of plans printed out for any of our jobs. Is that about right? A set of plans? How many sheets were in it? On average, like 60 sheets, 30 sheets. We charge like $1.80 a page, which is pretty standard, you know, for like a print shop. You can spend $5 a sheet if you go to Kinko's or something like that. Yeah, that's where we're paying $4. And Joe, real quick, while we got you here, if your experience with Kelsey and working out in the field, if you had a magic wand to fix a solution or a problem that you would like to have to support Kelsey, what would that look like? Like, what would you, if you can wave this wand to do something to help this company, what would you see? And I won't get mad if it says something to me. I think the most important thing would probably be just the work efficiency in some areas. Because, like he said, we have craning, we have service calls. We have orders, we have deliveries, and all that to be handled. We have something like Java, right, that makes our path the most efficient, but I feel like there's some things that we could do a little more efficiently in those areas. Yeah, better processes. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, like, I know what to do because the thing is, like, he was asking me, like, what's your process? Like, my process changes every time I talk to somebody because every opportunity is different. Like, if you develop a process, what happens is people say, oh, then we don't do that. And it's like, well, that was $500 out the window. I could have turned that into, you know, so I end up like, trying to manipulate things. But then what happens is like, I know how to do that now, but then I got to go and do the work. And that's where the work ends. Yeah, that's what I want to be like, okay, now Joe's going to step in and he's going to handle that so I can move on and keep, you know, pressing forward because that makes me not want to be that ambitious. Because every time I get, like, feeling good, I get ambitious, I start generating revenue, and then I get crushed by it and then I get depressed. stressed. stressed. stressed. I And then I'd go into the lake and get drunk for like two weeks. Yeah, yeah. What were you going say, Matthew? I think you had something. I have the business and I'm done working. Yeah, well, that's what was thinking.

12:12 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
You have so much knowledge in this space. And if we can get all that documented and in a training system, that can help you scale. Because you can go on to bigger and better opportunities. And you can also have people that are working for you that are doing the stuff that you already know how to do. And then you can focus on the ones that are the service calls that are like more unknown. And then you can tell them, like, yeah, we can do it. And then you go and figure out how to do it with all your expertise. And then eventually that becomes a training as well once you figure it out. And then it's like, OK, now we can also delegate that. And then this is how you scale and move into better opportunities. Yeah.

12:53 - Chris Andrade
I mean, like, yeah, because I like I like to go out and talk to people, you know, and meet people. And like my latest venture. And I started working towards is that there's a company here in town called Montroy. Montroy is a huge sign supplier. So they sell like all the lighted sign stuff and all the paper. They're a dealer for HP, Roland, like all these printers and stuff. And I got a relationship to them through a guy new from HP with that service manager over here. So I've been filling in and doing work for them. And I'm waiting to have a meeting with the owner because Montroy is the only company that's in this industry left that's still the owner you could point at. He's in California. So I'm to meet with that dude and be like, let me be an outside sales rep for you and maybe kind of direct my supplies that way as a commission driven thing or something to where I don't have to logistically handle the moving around of it and everything. Because like, you know, I can buy a printer and sell it and make 5,000 bucks or I can sell a roll of paper for $10. And I, I don't have time for that , man. Like, I'm not saying it's not a good thing to do, but the way we do it, it's not efficient, you know, like we deliver everything and to ship. The reason why we do that is because if we were to. to ship 20 rolls of paper, it costs like 500 bucks. And it doesn't make any sense. We're not Amazon, you know, and I'm not trying to compete with Amazon, but if we charge the shipping for the paper, it costs as much of the paper. Good morning. Good morning. Nice to meet you. my wife. She came. See ya. Chris, Andrade, nice to meet ya. Hi. Yeah, we had an opportunity here with Joe and Pickett Brain and we have the whole team here. So we have Matthew McHale. Yeah, we'll go through the introductions. Okay, pull up a seat next to Kelsey so you can be on camera. Come on. No, no. You can sit there. I'll move the chair. Okay. Yeah, I want you to meet the team here. Yeah, yeah. Hey, thanks for being here.

14:43 - Trent Christopher
Appreciate it. Hey, how you doing? Good morning. Good morning.

14:48 - Mekaiel Abdullahi
Yeah, yeah.

14:50 - Chris Andrade
So... Yeah, go ahead, Yeah, I just wanted to say something real quick, guys. So, you know, we barely met once, right? And it was random, like, just go to your garage and knock in your... And, you know, I just wanted to say that I met this gentleman by a customer, I was a customer, I thought we needed a plot printer, and I found him on Facebook. And he came to us literally the next day, like we needed a plot printer, he brought it to us, delivered it, unwrapped it, set it all up, put the software on my computer. I was just impressed with the overall service that we forgot. And, and then, I don't know, I just love this dude. Like, I just honestly developed not just a, I wasn't a client, we turned it into a friendship, I feel. So, I've been, we've each other for almost three years. And yeah, it's been kind of crazy that I went from being a client to a customer. And I'm excited to introduce you to these guys here. We'll go ahead and just start making our introductions. Sure. Hey, thanks, Chris.

15:59 - Trent Christopher
Appreciate it. Um, So just, you know, I don't want to make this you formal. Okay. So this is a, this is a casual conversation with us. We're just going to try to get to know you a little bit better. What, what you have going on. And we'll talk about the interview that you already had with Chris and, you know, what we, how we've seen that viewed it and what we've done with it. And then we'll, we'll talk a little bit about, you know, what you think you want to have in the business, like what the magic, the magic would be the, the, the end, the end goal. Right. So, um, we've kind of already talked about that a little bit, uh, briefly before this. Um, so, you know, we, we think good.

16:38 - Chris Andrade
You guys are all in different places. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So what's your specialty? So, so I'm Trent Christopher.

16:46 - Trent Christopher
You probably see it on my, on my video here, but so I have been in industrial automation for 22 years, mostly as a controls engineer. So typically what I would be doing is I would be programming things with. Sensors and motors and robots and automating physical things. So you talk about the Elucid motors, they have a whole manufacturing facility, I assume, multiple of them, and that's actually my background, is Honda. I cut my teeth inside of a Honda manufacturing facility. wow. Yeah.

17:21 - Chris Andrade
They're really serious over there, man. They're like, it takes seven minutes and 40 seconds to install one of these strips on a car. Yeah. Yeah. Okay.

17:30 - Trent Christopher
So that, my background is, you know, doing, I started with what's called a system integrator. It's basically a service, like engineering as a service and technician as a service company where they would just kind of hire me out and then just send me places. So I kind of learned a lot of different things where I could wire things up. I could, you know, troubleshoot things to try to solve the problem. And then I worked my way into engineering so I could do programming, project management, electrical design. Yeah. Yeah. Parts specification, procurement, all sorts of stuff because it was a small place. was one of three engineers and we just shared the responsibilities. Then I moved into a machine builder. So the machine builder was, they're roughly about $30 million a year business. And I was focused on one domain. I was able to shift from wearing 12 hats to wearing basically one hat, where I just focused on programming and integration, as we call it. So the integration of making all the sensors and the motors and the programmable devices, PLCs, all kind of bring everything together to make it do something instead of be a paperweight. So I did that for five years and then I moved to Omron Electronics, which is a multi-billion dollar corporation or like $8 billion globally or something. And I worked for them as an engineer, primarily supporting sales, but still doing what I love, which is kind of why I'm here today. somebody else. Thank That eventually, I said, you know what, the corporate world is too slow, too much policy. I can't move. I'm restricted by what I have to use this catalog I'm limited to. And then I said, you know, I want to do my own thing. So I want to be able to do it my own way. I want to be able to, you know, help people faster, because that was one thing that always killed me was that, you know, working for these other companies, I'm like, there's got to be a better way to do things. Mm hmm. So that's when I started my company for zero hero. And that was focused on industrial internet of things, really just taking and connecting machines to higher level, like software and systems and databases and all sorts of stuff, right? That was my that's my focus in this business here. But since then, in the last couple months here, I've been really shifting my focus to helping business owners like yourself to be be able to be do some of this, the physical automation. did. I want So do that for businesses internally, small, medium business for their business processes and integrations and stuff. So that's kind of me. I met these guys probably was a couple weeks ago, three weeks ago. December 3rd. Yeah.

20:17 - Chris Andrade
And we all kind of have a similar mindset.

20:19 - Trent Christopher
I mean, it was pretty awesome, to be honest, that we have been able to come together. And for real, we created something for real. And we really think that it's really going to help some people. So we're excited to have your ear so that we can help.

20:37 - Chris Andrade
Okay. So what's the game plan for today? What are we talking about? What's the goal? What are we trying to accomplish? So, yeah. Malik, go ahead and run through. He'll be the one orchestra, isn't it? Yeah.

20:51 - Mekaiel Abdullahi
I just want to give Matthew a chance to quickly introduce himself and then I'll introduce myself and then quickly if you guys want to just share a lot of mechanics. We heard a lot of the transcripts and everything else. you guys. Welcome. Thank So we kind of have a good idea. We just wanted to give you a quick chance. And then I'll turn it over to Trent to kind of go over the agenda and the flow of today. Okay. Yeah, I can just go quick.

21:11 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
So I worked at Amazon as a software development engineer for about six years. So I started off learning the ropes from people way smarter than me and just figuring out how to deliver production grade software, all the testing required to make sure that because we would serve people like millions hundreds of thousands of customers and we needed to make sure that the software runs smoothly. We can track all the metrics, make sure everything works. And then about three and a half years ago, I started my own e-commerce company. And so I dove into entrepreneurship and man, I can, I can totally see how there's so many different opportunities, so many things to focus on, but you really need to delegate and figure out how you can actually scale your company. And, and understanding the pain points is something that. I think we really want to focus on because if we can understand where time is being spent on like lower income activities by someone like you, Kelsey, who is like, you know so much and you have these higher paying opportunities that you just can't spend time on because you're focused, you have to fulfill these service calls. But what I think can unlock scale is essentially like training system that we get all your knowledge documented so that any number of people whenever you can afford to hire people, and they can essentially get trained on your knowledge, this is my vision for this stuff is like, then they can start doing the things and freeing up your time. So you can spend your time on the higher income opportunities and bring more revenue in to be able to hire more people. And it goes from there. So that's kind of, I guess, me in a nutshell for what we want to do for you.

23:00 - Mekaiel Abdullahi
Just very quickly, my name is Mekaiel. I'm 30 years old. I live in Washington, D.C. My professional background is mostly in information technology, mostly in the Department of State and Department of Defense. I got my start in the Air Force. I worked as a 3D X1X, which is pretty much jack of all trades, master of none. Supported the largest Air Force base in Ramstein in Germany and all in Europe, working for NATO headquarters up there. And then I moved to D.C. in 2020 in the middle of a pandemic. Supported a contract at the Pentagon doing system admin and system engineering. I did that for about two years. And after that, I moved on to the Department of State, where I was doing security system integrations for embassies. So I've traveled all around the world in technical security upgrades for U.S. embassies. Did about 15 in two years, left them last year at this time, and took a contract with MIT Research Engineering doing network security. I'm currently doing that right now. As well as forming this agency, little bit I want to know background is just like getting together, solving, I have a lot of experience in like, if you guys think small business is bad, government is even worse, so lack of documentation and processes and I'm very familiar with processes and systems, so tying together those systems and processes, all sorts of documentation, and I'm kind of trying to, we came together about a month ago, met these guys in that elite group of entrepreneurs, really just trying to build an agency, we decided to come together, because all of our visions align, it is a lot to kind of, we all understood, it is a lot to fulfill the quality of work that we want to provide, so that's kind of why we partnered up, and just a brief overview of the overall agency, it's called Arise Group AI, we offer engineering as a service to small businesses, trying to use AI to unlock time, simplicity and growth, that's kind of our goal, I'll turn it back over to Trent to go to the rest of agenda. Thanks, Mikkel.

25:01 - Trent Christopher
So, yeah, really, this is about whether we're using AI or not, it's really just finding ways to do more with less, try to free up some of your time so you can focus on things that, like, you know, you're working on the business instead of in the business. So that's kind of the goal.

25:17 - Chris Andrade
I'm in it, bro. Yeah, yeah. You're deep in it. Like, elbow deep, literally. Yeah. So, yeah, yeah.

25:26 - Trent Christopher
So anyway, so we were asked to, you know, sort of evaluate your previous engagement, right, with Malik. Yeah.

25:38 - Chris Andrade
Yeah.

25:39 - Trent Christopher
Let's just touch on it real quick. Yeah, we don't have to spend a lot of time on it, but just so we can touch on it, we looked at it, there's a bunch of documents and there's seems like they're kind of like rough notes and maybe some plans that kind of like expanded to over an eight month plan. Go ahead. But I...

26:00 - Chris Andrade
Luke's project was, it was word salad to me. So it was, I'm going to say, I'm going to do this. And then all of this stuff doesn't, it just, it's just word salad. It didn't mean anything. I want get paid for it. And I got tired of it and I'm not doing that anymore. So I stopped it. Yeah. And, um, you know, I gotta say, I mean, my, my, you know, he did some to my website that I'm not really sure what he did to, because I don't know how to do But the whole thing is just kind of like, whatever, because I'm busy doing other things for word salad. And I'm not doing that again. Yeah. We take that very seriously. And yeah, we do. We definitely take that to heart. And it's my fault. You know, like I just, you know, I met this guy. thought I was going to help him at first and it turned into just this kind of like usual. So yeah, we're on the right path now. So anyways, what can we do to fix this? Or what can we do to use AI? Or how can we make it more simpler? How are people doing it, bro? Like, I don't Yeah. Okay.

27:02 - Trent Christopher
Let's, let's talk a little bit about, you know, how we got here. Right. So you had an interview with Chris and he mic'd you up and he gave you, you know, basically what happened is he just asked you some questions and you answered them. And we, we listened to the, actually, I'm going to back up. We took the transcription. So all of the words, and we, we created some pretty cool stuff that I'm going to show you. But what really matters is that we, we exposed a lot of possibilities in your business that we, we know we can help with. And it all came from just one opportunity conversation with you.

27:40 - Chris Andrade
Yeah. Okay. Yeah. I remember it was this thing right here. Oh yeah. When, when I brought it over, that was our initial interview and the five question framework, the biggest problems, the cost of the problem. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

27:56 - Trent Christopher
So I'm going to share my screen. Um, yeah, I hope. I that that comes up okay in what you're viewing, okay? looks like it should be good. I started on a TV. Got it. Okay, are able to see that okay?

28:11 - Chris Andrade
Yeah. I can zoom in. You could probably, yeah. There you go. Oh yeah, that's good. can read it. We've got it.

28:22 - Trent Christopher
Okay, so what we were able to do, I'm just going to give you just, the detail itself isn't as important as you just understanding the level of value that that conversation really means to us in being able to help you. Like really, we want to help you, and we didn't get a chance to talk to you until now. Not really, right? Yeah. But we feel like we also have a pretty good insight, at least to the conversation that you had with Chris, that we were able to take that and we were able to see a lot of potential in helping you, okay? Yes. All

29:03 - Chris Andrade
Yeah, were able to see quite a bit there.

29:06 - Trent Christopher
So what I want to show you real quick is that I'm not even going talk about the process that we went through. All I really want to tell you is that to highlight the value of you, you took a microphone and you attached it to yourself before the interview, and you walked away, and you went and helped some people. Oh, yeah. That, while you might have highlighted that the interview, like the interview was the important part, I honestly think that when I listened to the audio, when I took and saw what you did, or like listened to what you did, you really care about helping them, and you are absolutely on point with your expertise. You know your . So, so that's really important, I think.

29:57 - Chris Andrade
I didn't realize, that's right, because, because Chris was having some. Yeah. He recorded that time. went over and helped the neighbor with his laminator. Yeah, yeah. Yeah. Well, I'm a little gold with that guy because he owes me rent money. I mean, I helped that guy. owes me like $2,000, dude. That still helped his . Yeah.

30:14 - Trent Christopher
So what I want to show you here, if you can see it, hopefully. Let's see if I can zoom out a little bit.

30:21 - Chris Andrade
Yeah, I'm going to. Give me a second. Get a little position on this since my screen is a little.

30:28 - Trent Christopher
Okay, so we can dig into the detail. But what I really wanted to show you was this right here. This is you adjusting the laminator.

30:40 - Chris Andrade
Okay, this is you. I just walked in too. She's the one that handles my back end office when I'm not here. I didn't realize we were supposed to be having a meeting today. That's okay. Yeah, yeah. So we took, we heard what you said in our last interview and we're kind of going over the assessment for that. It's just a little. cool. Like a nice. Okay, so explain this to me because I don't know. I'm not good with charts, but yeah. So what this is, is this is actually you.

31:07 - Trent Christopher
Let me see if I can find it real quick. This is actually you describing in the audio as you're talking to the client, talking to your customer, explaining to them how to use the laminator, how to feed the material in. Okay. This right here is a diagram that breaks that down and can explain the way that you do that. You prepare the environment, you, and then here's some tips. Cover the laminator when not in use to avoid dust buildup, keep the rag handy. But down here, there's some information about set up film roll, load film, set spindles to 69 to 70. Thread film, lift roller, wrap over drive roll, attach, take up the, take up backer to empty core. Some tips down here is clear packing tape works better than masking tape on laminate backer. Okay. Okay. Wow.

32:01 - Chris Andrade
These are your transcripts. Don't cut the wheels. That's a good one. Use a blade that won't damage the rollers.

32:09 - Trent Christopher
Okay. So, and there's, is the tracking crooked? Then check all the clutches to set the same position. Okay.

32:18 - Chris Andrade
All right. So the AI pulled this out of the conversation or what? Yeah. So we have to build it. Right. And you what you're seeing is that the, explain what we're seeing here. Like what's, what is this a flow chart? The, the flow chart is your laminator setup.

32:37 - Trent Christopher
So it is effectively a, it's a, it's a manual.

32:41 - Chris Andrade
It's a user manual to do that.

32:43 - Trent Christopher
That you described to him. So basically put it down into flow chart.

32:48 - Chris Andrade
can try try. Do you want to go over how this is important? You can share that with the customer and have it available on the internet. And this isn't what it looks like at the end, right? Right. Yeah. Yeah. This.

33:01 - Trent Christopher
This may not be the final product. Everything that I show you may not be your final product of what it looks like in a usable day-to-day sense, okay? But what is important is that we were able to extract and help create ways that you can share knowledge. So we can extract Kelsey, put Kelsey into these bio, these documents that you can share to your clients, you can share to Joe, or to the next technician that you hire, okay?

33:34 - Chris Andrade
If I could literally, like, have a camera on me and go out all day, like, literally just go out, like, okay, today I'm going to be working on this, that, and the other. And then just, you know, in the car before I go in, just be like, all right, I'm here, I'm working on this so-and-so printer, it has a system error code, this and that. And just let it record me while I go in there and then just educate, you know, either the customer or take Joe with me and just tell him what's I on the whole time. Well, let's cover that real quick. I understand, man. I remember there was a video, when I made some videos, me and my wife made videos when I had my old company. But there was a video online on how to set up an HP printer to the network. This Hillbilly made. It had hundreds of thousands of views, dude. I mean, hundreds of thousands. So all these things that people are dealing with, like problems all the time. I got a whole shop next door full of print heads and parts. I mean, I could teach people how to make fixed print heads and, like, you want to buy my ink? This is how you fix your print head when it takes a , you know? Syringe, fill it up, stick it in, put it in, done. Like $500. Yeah, so let me take one step backward.

34:43 - Trent Christopher
What we've overarching, the issues that we, we don't have all the information, by the way, right? We've only, this is only through one conversation.

34:52 - Chris Andrade
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

34:52 - Trent Christopher
So, based on the conversation, what we've identified as your biggest issues are you don't have time. They're there. Know You can't work on anything else because you don't have time. Why don't you have time? You don't have time because you have a hard time being able to communicate to Joe or to Alyssa or to your clients because you're so busy with your hands in the printer all the time and you can't answer phone calls. So if we can give you some relief of that time, okay, now you can do several things, right? You can either focus on the higher priority items that might be higher dollar figure, but then again, that's also you spending more time in the field. So if we can train Joe or give some tools to you that you can train Joe or any other technician, okay, asynchronously, meaning Joe can take care of, let's say 50% of the work now, okay? You don't want him riding along with you all the time because- No, no, I've only been doing that just to get him trained up, it's like he did it as much as he could, but then all of a sudden it was

36:00 - Chris Andrade
Like, boom. It's like, we can't do it all. Like you have to go your own way now because otherwise there's not enough time in the day. Yeah.

36:06 - Trent Christopher
So you could potentially be, as you take these service calls, passively collecting what you're doing and we can create the information that can be shared to Joe or anybody else so that you are basically, you're compounding your knowledge into your business. You're sharing that with everybody in your business, not only now for who you have now, but into the future as well. Yeah. It's a good idea, man.

36:35 - Chris Andrade
I mean, I really, it's something I've always thought about doing for a long time, but just can't really figure out how to get it together. You know, and now like I've got all the to do it. I got video cameras and whatever, but just the setting it up before I walk in the door, I can't even, gives me anxiety. Like all that you just did right now. It's like, that, man. Like, I need, I can do this mic, dude. This is pretty easy. Yeah. So that's the problem, right? Is that you don't have.

37:00 - Trent Christopher
the time to spend the time to create the processes that give you more time. you're in a catch- No, I'm going to all the information.

37:06 - Chris Andrade
Like when I get home, I'm going to hang out with her while I'm watching a movie and edit some video or- Yeah, yeah.

37:13 - Trent Christopher
So we believe that the primary things for you to move to the next stages are really to give you ways to communicate better. And that comes through processes, right? Establishing processes and being able to communicate those processes. Okay. But they have to be in a usable way too, right? Like you can create this document that's heavily detailed and you can put it someplace where people can read it, but if they don't read it, they don't read it.

37:44 - Chris Andrade
Yeah.

37:45 - Trent Christopher
So we can also take that knowledge and we can put it into a knowledge base so that when Joe has time to look at it, he can look at it. Or if he doesn't have time to look at it, he can just search it real quick and find the specifics about what he's trying to do to see if there's Anything that you've done in the past. Right. So effectively, what we're trying to do is we're really just trying to encapsulate your knowledge so that you can propagate that across your whole your whole business, your whole organization.

38:13 - Chris Andrade
Say again. She said, how are you going to capture it? How are you going to capture his knowledge?

38:19 - Trent Christopher
Either microphone or video is the best ways to do it. Ideally, we would try to make it as passive as possible so he doesn't have to spend a lot of time in setup.

38:29 - Chris Andrade
So it will be helping like understand the process like I would be physically here to make sure that these are done in a way that makes sense. Right. So I'll be here physically to support whatever route that we go or what because that's what we're here for is to see ultimately because there's so much. I know. But what are you doing physically? Are you going to be following him around recording him and watching him? And you know, if we go there. there. That route, like the team and I discussed, like Insta360 has these little mini cameras that have a lanyard, and if he had two of them, he could have redundancy, so he could always have just a little lanyard sitting on his chest, and it's really small, it's like a little pill, you don't even see it or feel it, and you just, go ahead.

39:20 - Trent Christopher
And Chris, like that's, Chris is like painting a picture of, you know, what he envisions as the future, like it would be awesome if you could just put a thing in here, that just records everything, and you don't have to do anything other than that, right, the simplest, easiest thing to do is if you can just record yourself talking, and you talk yourself through it, as if you're explaining it to somebody, and you just were able to give us the recording, or we give you a place to put the recording itself, it, it, that is like the easiest thing that we can start to work on like today, or tomorrow, whatever, however you want to put that, to do something similar, go ahead.

39:59 - Chris Andrade
What does that look like? I don't understand. So he's going to wake up every day. He's going to get dressed. He's going to put something on to his body and he's going to go to work every day. And then at the end of the day, he's going to send this information to you. Does he have a smartphone?

40:16 - Trent Christopher
Yeah. Android phone or an iPhone. We have plenty of technology.

40:23 - Chris Andrade
I'm just asking, what does that look like? I have a phone, but I use it constantly. So like, if I had a device that I could just wear, I think it'd be, it'd be easier. Yeah. Yeah. I gotcha. I gotcha.

40:35 - Trent Christopher
Um, so we'll, we'll work through, you know, exactly what device or what works best for you. Right. Cause it's not the same for everybody.

40:43 - Chris Andrade
Um, to like, he's going to send you guys the information. You're going to piece it together.

40:50 - Trent Christopher
Well, and yeah, in the, in the big picture of things, we would just make it to where he doesn't have to do that. That task. He would literally just record the audio. And everything else happens. Big picture that like the whole upload and everything.

41:06 - Chris Andrade
Okay. Oh, really? Really? That would be the mission. Yeah. Yeah. Like just go to a job and just like title it what it's going to be and then record it and then you don't even have to title it. Oh, . You're going to be talking to it. So we're going to know. No, I mean, like, I don't have any experienced guys with a AI. I mean, that's what I have a little bit. Like I recently got my new iPhone. got a subscription to Chad GTV because it's in there. And I talked to that dude and we like have a good time with him. know, me and Nicky will like have a conversation with him and like mine's cooler than hers is. And it's, you know, but it's in this like loop of it only does certain things. Like I like asking it like deep, but theological questions and, you know, like evolution and where did God come from? But I've been like, it's pretty wild to me, dude. Like I just, it just won't do anything for me. I'm like, can you go on the I'm If service manuals and look up this error code for me, it's like, I can't do that. I'm like, why the not? Yeah.

42:05 - Trent Christopher
So that, I mean, it's awesome technology. It's just like, how do you harness it? Yeah, exactly.

42:10 - Chris Andrade
You have more to do. Like, that's all I've noticed about technology since I started my business is every piece I've added has added a bigger headache to my life. Yeah. I mean, website, this, that, like now I just got like 50 pieces, like laying all over the place. And I don't know how to grip onto it. Yeah. I think what they're, it seems like they, they're on vision. I think they're, Alyssa, you're more concerned with like the support, like how, like we have this grand plan. Right. And you're more like, how do you, you can't see it. Cause there's so much. Right. And so maybe if we can focus on like, how do we plan to support them to figure out ultimately what is the best case for them? Like we can, we can totally. Yeah. You can generate more business by making these videos and things, but like, what about logistically on the background? How can we bring like a website and jobber and everything to like one umbrella or something? Have you guys thought about that? Yeah.

43:15 - Trent Christopher
So on the front end, we identified that collecting your knowledge is probably a key to you scaling. But also right now you have a bit of a communication problem. Yeah. Amen. It's not that you are bad at communicating. It's the channels and the methods and the timing that is a problem. So it's, it's really the fact that you are servicing everybody and you're getting phone calls off the hook and you can't answer them. Or, uh, you need to relay stuff back to Alyssa or Alyssa needs to relay stuff to you or, you know, you know, I'm having conversations all day long and then she's sitting over here.

43:59 - Chris Andrade
Like she doesn't know what I do. Facebook's, And I like expect her to like, I don't, I'm not good at putting notes in the system. So she puts all kinds of notes everywhere, but I don't. I don't read her notes because I don't put my notes in. So it's like, I don't know where to look sometimes to find the answer.

44:16 - Trent Christopher
So one of the things to set you up, both hopefully give you some relief now, and then also set us up to help you better later is, is to try to find a way that you can continue using your channel. Your phone is your primary channel of communicating with people. Right. Yeah, absolutely.

44:35 - Chris Andrade
I mean, everybody calls my cell phone. You know, they're starting to get to call in the list because I'm trying to push them over there, but yeah.

44:42 - Trent Christopher
So, so.

44:45 - Chris Andrade
Jobber program that we're using. I don't know if you guys have looked into that at all, but it's pretty powerful. It helps me a lot in the field to keep, you know, putting my notes on the job and. Yeah, you retouched on that because you went really into depth on that. So we have some really good stuff. And I don't know, I'm probably not using it until it's full of capabilities, but it's, it's been the most helpful thing that we've gotten into since I started my business, I would say, for sure. Right, for sure. And it made our numbers go up, even though I didn't notice, we, the, the, the, the, we were super unproductive before we got onto that common platform and having the text message capabilities right from it, where we're, I'm starting to force people over there more. And they've been adding features, like they just added last week, the feature to attach a picture to a text message, which was holding me up from using it. Now I can attach pictures and stuff in there. So I don't, there's no reason for me to really even communicate through my personal cell phone. I'm trying to like drive it back over to Jobber, but Jobber's got AI, Outlook's got AI, Microsoft has it, these guys have it. It's just confusing as hell, man. It's crazy, right?

45:54 - Trent Christopher
That was important to us when we were thinking about how we can help you is that, how can we simplify? And we also not complicate it. So we want to put tools in place to help you, but we want to not disrupt the way that you communicate now. Right? We have to make sure that we're not giving you an extra tool that you need to use, like an extra communication channel. So one of the things we talked about is there's, there are multiple services that are for the phone, okay, that can help route and collect information and potentially even answer Those your phone calls for you that can collect information about what the call is about. So for example, Joe calls you, maybe not your Joe, let's say Fred, Fred's printing service calls you and they're calling this phone number. The phone number right now is going to your cell phone. So your cell phone, you have to either answer it or you can't get to it. Right? But you don't know what that calls about until you actually speak to them. So it could be urgent or maybe it's. It's non-urgent. That's just an example. Yeah. They could potentially have that call answered by something else, an agent of sorts, or it could be rerouted and it could be sent to Alyssa back in the back.

47:13 - Chris Andrade
We've, we've played with that. You know, I forward my calls to her sometimes, but then I forget to unfoward them. And yeah, so on that route before, right. I just, I just like what I normally do is like, they'll call me in the middle of a service call. I'll answer it. And then if it's somewhere she needs to get involved, I conference her in on the thing and I just set the phone aside and let them let her deal with it. Well, that's pretty cool. Go back to doing what I was doing. Yeah. I mean, that's, that's how I'm currently handling it. Yeah. And all my communication is via text message because it's easier than an email. So like, hey, Siri, screenshot this and send it to the office cell phone. Boom. You know, like I'm learning how to like do those little like things where I don't have to do it with my fingers and stuff. Yeah.

47:54 - Trent Christopher
So what we're trying to find is way that we can capture and automate some of that stuff, make it easier. Yeah. We to be able to track it and maybe take some of the workload, primarily your workload. trying, we're focused on that one because you seem to be the bottleneck currently of trying to get things done. So also helping Alyssa on the back end as well, where we want to, we want to somehow be inside of that communication channel. So your phone. Yeah. We want that to be something that we can tap into. And we want to, we want to use jobber.

48:28 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
So we want to like make sure everything gets recorded in jobber more efficiently. Yep.

48:34 - Chris Andrade
Yeah. Yeah.

48:36 - Trent Christopher
We, we, you definitely rely on jobber and you want to use jobber as much as you possibly can, at least at this point. And what we're trying to do is put a tool in place that helps communicate with jobber and your communication between everybody else in your business.

48:54 - Chris Andrade
Yeah. Yeah. No, I think that's, that's, where the, that's where the problem is kind of because. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah So it's hard for me to relay. I get so overwhelmed sometimes. Just getting the words out of my mouth is difficult to why I don't want to do it. I'm just like, I don't even know how to get this out of my mouth right now. Yeah. So there's a service called...

49:15 - Trent Christopher
Actually, I'll go. me go. Hey, just really quick. I just want to review.

49:19 - Mekaiel Abdullahi
I don't want to lose you guys, Joe, Kelsey, and Melissa. I just want to review just where we're at currently. So Trent just reviewed and showed you... You're looking at the opportunity matrix, but before that, he showed you some of the processes that go into your business and how he got through the opportunity matrix. What we use it for is just to identify the highest leverage opportunities and how, as you can see, which ones are deprioritized, which ones are going to be big swings, which ones are going to be nice to have, and some quick wins. So all of the things that we're talking about today are categorized as quick wins, easy, small solutions to help you guys get more efficient today with your current tool set. So kind of like... Wait, real quick.

49:58 - Chris Andrade
What was that? Can you do... Oh, inventory. That's another thing that we're struggling. We're getting ready to do that, actually. Yeah, we know. I mean, we don't know the details, but we know that you've mentioned it. It's a highlight in your conversation. Yeah, I think he's working on that with her sister and this bookkeeper to get our books all cleaned up by January so we can get our inventory straightened out. Yeah.

50:22 - Trent Christopher
So let's just touch on that real quick, like Mikkel was just talking. I want to make sure we just pause on that. Yeah, yeah. What we're talking about right now is to start setting you up so that you can work towards these bigger goals. And inventory is definitely an immediate problem that you have, but we can't do it in a short timeframe. That's going to be a longer timeframe to get that in place, right?

50:50 - Chris Andrade
Sure. I agree.

50:51 - Trent Christopher
If we can get you some relief, and Alyssa, some relief in communication channels and automating some of that. Yeah. So it gives you more time. It gives you more time that you can spend on trying to address the inventory and a system, right? You need to have a, and I'm not talking necessarily about a digital system at this, you know, at the very first point, you guys are going through it manually, right? You're going to have an Excel spreadsheet or a dry erase board or whatever you want to use to just get the system in place. But long-term, we would love to be able to help you with a digital system that helps you with that. Yeah. Yeah. No, for sure.

51:29 - Chris Andrade
Because like figuring out what we need to order, whatever, like Alyssa kind of got the guy that was handling my inventory stuff. He's no longer here. So Alyssa jumped in and she's been handling the inventory, but she doesn't necessarily know like what we should stock or shouldn't stock or whatever. So now we've got like things that we probably don't need and don't have things we do need. And like, I never down with her and had a meeting and said, Hey, I think we should have about this much in there. And we're not like looking at our past going like, well, these guys keep buying the same every month. Like, you know, so something that can overview. And that and help you with it, I'm sure would be pretty, pretty, pretty amazing. analytical side of it.

52:05 - Mekaiel Abdullahi
Just really quick, really quick, in order to get to that, it's very important to understand what that takes and how to get there. And if it's not documented, it's not going to help anyone. So like, what we're trying to do is essentially just figure out what you're doing, document that in order to build solutions to help you ease that problem, you know, because if it's not documented, then it's not, it's not going to matter. We can't be on top of it, essentially. Yeah.

52:31 - Trent Christopher
So we have to know what the process is, and it has to have some level of flow, maybe a little bit of rigidity or rules around it, right, so that we can help automate it. Like it has to have a process so that we can help automate it.

52:44 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
And something we could do early on is like, just collect all the data about the current inventory. And then we understand how does that inventory get modified over time? And that's the process. And then that's how we start building the system.

52:59 - Chris Andrade
This has. Some processes of things that she goes through and follows too that my sister-in-law put together, certain processes for like RMAs and different things that we got to deal with. But I mean, basically, the way it's going to happen is whenever an invoice gets generated, it's going to pull it from the inventory. And when a purchase order gets created and sent out, it's going to add it to the inventory. I mean, that's the goal. We just got to get the numbers right. And then we got to figure out the return policy because that's where numbers start going sideways. Oh, let me just get two and take one. And now, you know, there's a way to do that proper in the back end to make it so the numbers are right. Do you have a question? Yep. Not really. I mean, I do have an RMA process and I do know how to, you know, if something's taken out of inventory to take it out of our inventory, there is a way to do that. And I try to keep up with it. But if I don't know that it's taken out of inventory, then that whole process falls apart. And with RMAs, if the vendors are saying... Oh, no, you can't return this. and then some of our inventory goes into our own products. Like, you know, we go and grab an ink card drop the shelf because that printer over there is out of ink. And now that disappeared from our inventory. We're not really. She's making an invoice every month for the stuff we take out for that and then discounting at the end of the month towards printing. But whether that's right or not, I don't really know. Yeah. With the RMAs, it's literally just communicating with the vendors because we keep our stuff on the shelf for a long time. But they usually say, oh, if it's been on, you've had it for like a month, over a month now, you can't return it anymore. And then we have to argue. And then the RMAs stack up. And she argues with them and I call the owner and tell them how it is. Yeah, I argue with them for like a week. And then finally, I'm like, okay, Kelsey, they're not doing anything. And then he contacts and he's like, what's up?

54:49 - Mekaiel Abdullahi
Essentially, that all makes sense. Essentially, I feel like what it's going to take is just a period of time, maybe like two weeks, 30 days to track everything. And what's going in or what's coming out to get a baseline. We started collecting some of that information.

55:03 - Trent Christopher
How do you collect the information? Sorry, go ahead.

55:07 - Chris Andrade
I said, how do you collect the information? That's precisely what, yeah.

55:11 - Trent Christopher
Our first mission, two missions, right? So the first to set you up for the long term is to get you better communication and collect data. Like the communication is, you know, multiple, multifaceted. Okay. So it's the, this is the calls. It's the, it's the training to Joe. It's multifaceted there, but it's communication and processes, right? And collecting data. So the way that we can collect data is we talked about microphones to be able to potentially record what you're doing when you're out in the field. We've talked about potentially putting something in place of your phone that sits in the middle and it can route your call and it can transcribe your calls. It's basically recording them as you speak. Right. As. Once people text you, we can take those messages, and we can collect them for now if we want, or we can act on them. We can, if somebody says, hey, I got an urgent problem.

56:11 - Chris Andrade
can put something on my phone that will record every conversation I have throughout the day and keep track of my text messages. And when I say certain things, whatever, then it can take that information. Because it's hard. I'll be in the middle of this . And, like, I literally have to stop everything I'm doing and either send a text, which I can't do when I'm talking to somebody because I can't transcribe it, you know, so I have to physically type it or whatever. So if I could get something on my phone that would catch all my text messages, my communication there, and my that, and then say, Kelsey, you said this, that, and the other, that would be pretty cool, I think. I don't know how that looks, but.

56:52 - Trent Christopher
That's, I mean, that's actually what we're trying to do. We're trying to put something right in the middle of your business that is at the center of a phone.

57:00 - Chris Andrade
Okay, like the phone is the center?

57:02 - Trent Christopher
Yes. I think this is a good idea.

57:05 - Chris Andrade
So you have it. Yeah, there you go. There it is.

57:10 - Trent Christopher
I'm trying to get this so it's in this screen here. But so what this is, this product is, it's called Quo. And what you do is you can either create a new business number or you can migrate in a new number or your number existing. And then what it does is when people call you or text you, it will route it into this system, like they're unaware of it. Like the user is unaware that they're dialing your number just like they would any other time, but it can route the call appropriately. So it can, if you're busy, it can go to Alyssa or vice versa. Not only that, but when they send you a text or when they call you or when you have a conversation with them, it records it and transcribes it into words. We can integrate our AI or their AI. Or whatever your systems are, we can actually connect them together. And we can act on the messages.

58:07 - Chris Andrade
We can act on the phone call.

58:09 - Trent Christopher
So if Fred says he's down.

58:11 - Chris Andrade
If I say like, as I'm talking to Jim Bob, I'm like, okay, you need an FC 9000-160, dude, I'll send you a quote. Boom. Like, it's going to be like, you need to make this quote, or it'll actually make the quote. Boom.

58:24 - Trent Christopher
Exactly. We've already demoed this stuff out. We've already proof of concepted the, the automation of creating proposals and sending them out.

58:34 - Chris Andrade
So that piece. I would like to do them before they go, but I mean, all of the, like, what's our cost on this ? Like, I'm always like, Alyssa, how much are we paying for this? It's like, I can't see it from my cell phone app. I've got to go into like, I want it to tell me, yeah, you paid this and that, and this is how much you're going to make. Like, you know, like I have to go back and I got to find , bro. Like, I just got this Dropbox account set up like a week ago. I can't find , man. Like price lists and things like that, that the vendor sent. I have to go and search my inbox. I don't have a good way of organizing my internal files either, bro. It's a mess, man. Yeah, so the nice thing... Sorry, go ahead. No, no, I was saying, I remember I was talking about my files and my computer is like legit the same situation. I mean, I just got it to where all my stuff is available to me everywhere I go now and it's all the same. So at least I got that going for me so I could start to try and sift through it. I had stored all over different places and stuff before, so I fixed that. But that, whatever that, what is this, how much does this thing cost? This conversation thing. So you're saying like, is this a phone system?

59:39 - Trent Christopher
This is a phone system that sits in the background, but you can use your phone number and it can direct to your phone. Like you can pretty much use your phone the way that you use it already, but it will be, basically this sits in the middle. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

59:56 - Chris Andrade
Between you and someone else.

59:58 - Trent Christopher
So like you and Alyssa, are you and... So we could also be sitting, so I currently use something called Vonage.

1:00:04 - Chris Andrade
I would take, get rid of Vonage, report it over here. Yeah. Okay. That sounds great because Vonage sucks really. I don't like it that much. I mean, it's, it sucks, dude. I mean, I inherited it from my IT guy and I've just been using it because I have my phone number there, but I don't like people texting there because it has some other app I got to deal with. I'm trying to drive people to text the jobber, but then they text to the main number and nobody's paying attention to that number. And if I don't see it over here, then I don't know. They sent a message. Yeah. The idea would be that they have one number, right?

1:00:36 - Trent Christopher
The idea would be that they have one number and it can either come to your phone number two now.

1:00:42 - Chris Andrade
So like jobber has its own texting number. So when you call my main number or when you call my jobber number, it forwards to my main number. Like, you know, so that I normally, but I normally, all my documentation has my main number on it, you know? So like if somebody texts the main number that doesn't go into jobber. So I should. So start using my jobber number as my main number and not that 602 number, or I just, I don't know how to get those to come together, but I'm willing to change to this system. I mean, this seems way better.

1:01:09 - Trent Christopher
So here's what I would say is you're giving us some information that we're going to need, but we didn't have, right? So part of this process of us helping you is going to be, we're going to have to understand the details of how you work and what systems you're using now. Like Vonage, we didn't know that you had that until now. So we will have to spend some time understanding and asking you some questions on how it all works, right? So, but at the end of the day, the whole goal is how can we get the communications better? Collect the information from the phone calls, text messages, emails, everything that is passing through you and your business. Is there a way to connect this the inbox?

1:01:50 - Chris Andrade
What's that? Say again? Yeah. you connect this type of thing to the inbox too? The inboxes? What do you mean by inbox?

1:01:56 - Trent Christopher
Inbox is voicemail? I have emails. I have service apps.

1:02:00 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Supplier Mechanics, Sales, Supplies, Kelsey, Accounting We can hook our back-end system to email, what we're thinking is we can potentially, so we can hook up this Quo and have our back-end system basically connect to your phone, your email, all your communications, and then update Jobber based on the details from the communications, and then you or Alyssa will like review those updates, instead of having to go back and forth on all this stuff, you essentially review the updates and make sure it's good.

1:02:37 - Chris Andrade
Yeah, yeah.

1:02:38 - Trent Christopher
The end mission would be able to give you a command center, right? That all of these things are coming through your business, and you see the things that are important to you, Alyssa sees the things that are important to her, at the time that it makes the most sense. That's like the end mission. Right now, this service, Quo, it will We'll immediately tie into Jobber. So we can get the benefits of Jobber and the benefits of Quo, and then also enhance those abilities because they plug into each other already. Really? Yeah.

1:03:15 - Chris Andrade
Okay. I never heard of Quo. I don't know how to use Zapier for , but I think I could probably use that somehow. We got you. Yeah, I can't either. The other day, I got excited because I told AI I wanted to make a Zap to make my Shopify order going to Jobber automatically, and it was all, it got all the way there, and it was like, eh. I was like, damn it. That was so close. I thought it was going work. The whole Shopify thing sucks, dude. Is there something? It's not even integrated or working. It's not even connected to QuickBooks, or it's just sitting out there in La La Land. I feel like Kelsey's talking a lot, and I appreciate that, but I would like to give, like, is there something, like, concerns that, like, you foresee what we're talking about? Like, is there something that you want to see happen, or, like? What concerns you have? I'm here to listen. I'm here to learn. I hear Kelsey complain all the time. So whatever he's saying, I've heard it a million times already for five years. Right, right. And there's a lot of people out there that seem to have the solution, the solution, and they really never do. Right, right. I'm just here to listen, learn and see what you guys have to offer. Okay. And where we stand right now, in my mind, it seems like you guys have something comprehensive and solid. But I'm still skeptical, so I'm listening, and I'm learning. Yeah, 100 percent. Yeah. And the skepticism is...

1:05:00 - Trent Christopher
We know we understood that you've been burned over and over.

1:05:06 - Chris Andrade
I have a guy that comes in and sells me on some BS and says, he's going to change everything and fix all of Kelsey's problems. And then I pay him $10,000. And then I, I'm nowhere, I'm nowhere at the end of it. And then Kelsey's still complaining and actually worse than when you started. Yeah. So I'm to him complaining and I'm used to it now. So I just complain and I say, I'm sorry, honey, that sucks. I mean, I don't know how to fix it, but. Well, that seriously, like it, it, it pains me to hear that. Right. And this is like, honestly, I would not be sitting here introducing these guys to you guys. If I honestly felt like we could not help you guys, because I know my, all I'm trying to do is earn your trust. At the end of the day, that's all we're trying to do. All of us spent a lot of time just to figure out how do we. We have this conversation because you know you guys are technically our it's a painful part, man. If you guys can nail this down, like there's got to be, I'm not the only guy, man. Well, know. And that's why we are wanting to partner with you guys, like a transformation partnership. And you guys are helping us build our processes, our procedures, our onboarding systems. Like, Mekaiel, he has put so much work into this presentation for you guys, you know. And just ultimately, we're just here to like, we over thought this quite a bit. And then yesterday, when we're going over like how we're going to present this, we're like going over all our slides, right, Mekaiel? And we're like, holy , like this, we really need to dial this back. Because at the end of the day, we still don't have all the information we need, right? Yeah. At the end of the day, technically, this is like a two part interview, like to go through our auditing process. There's a whole, and Mekaiel was talking to that. We're only on our second version, but you can see what we got with just the very first. information. it. And we're still practicing. So I'll let you take it over, Mekaiel.

1:07:04 - Mekaiel Abdullahi
Yeah, so just kind of like the main details is just we understand where you're at. We all talk internally. We agree. Everything we kind of discuss in the plan is yours to get to keep. And that's just the sonic of faith to get you guys going, because honestly, we understand how it is. We're in the business, too. We talked to a lot of people. There are people like Malik out there. mean, it happens. And that's why we got together. We all have the same mindset, same goals, and we want to provide quality to our clients. So we all take pride in our work. This is all like we all do this for a reason. We're just trying to help. And yeah, whatever way we can help, we're here, too. At end of the day, if you guys win, we win. It's a process. It's a lot of work. And I think what Malik sold you guys on is similar to what we're selling you on, except for he underestimated how much working time is going to get there. Yeah, I think he really did.

1:07:59 - Chris Andrade
Because I don't I think you really looked into what all I'm in. I'm involved in a lot of different , you know, like, I mean, I had a guy here for five years, building that website, like, you know, putting all the pieces of it together, like, and really just trying to figure out where should I focus my energy, you know, like, it's not in new equipment sales, because that just drags you down, dude, you sell a new printer, now you got to take care of it for free for the next two years. Yeah, you know, I'd rather 100%. And then like, consumables, like, people are putting that in their printer all the time, they're buying every kind of thing. Under the sun from Amazon and everywhere else, like, so if I can come up with a product that because I my 's not perfect, but I know where it's made. It works good. I use it in my own equipment, you know, like, and I support it, like it, it saves the money. That's a good focus on the consumable side of it, it can be and that can all be automated and drop ship through my vendors I currently use, I wouldn't even have necessarily touch it. Yeah, from a, you know, I would talk, but a lot of it could just See, like, the order comes in, PO goes over there, it's already paid for, they got my logo, stick it on the cartridge, they ship it out, I don't touch it. That's how a lot of people are doing it already. I'm just not automated. Yeah. So... Do you mind if I jump in and ask a question? Please. Please. Currently, I haven't heard anything about where you guys are on pricing. How much does this cost? Amen. I'm looking at poor men right now, and that seems like the cost is going to be expensive. I'm not doubting, I'm not trying to question your ability to solve my problems, I'm just... What is something like this, this full integration cost, where are we at on that?

1:09:50 - Mekaiel Abdullahi
So just, I'll let Trent get into that, but just before we even do that, just, we all understand, like, it's a partnership on our side because we... We the ability to help you guys, but we're not the experts in your industry, you guys are, so it's going to be a process, it's going to take time, and we're going to have to work hand in hand to bring the tech and the skills together in order to make and scale your business, so it's going to take time, we're starting up, we're working out our processes, and we understand exactly where you guys are at. Chris has done a good job just like bridging us together, and yeah, let go into that.

1:10:28 - Trent Christopher
Yeah, so, I mean, the big thing, right, is that we're trying to work through and set you up as a, you know, the, the big mission that we had a little bit of fun and made a couple graphics. Like, I don't know if you are looking at the details of this, but this actually is based on, this is a graphic that's based on what we got from your transcript.

1:10:47 - Chris Andrade
Just the audio recording. Yeah, yeah. And the audio recording, and it came up with this cartoon. Yeah.

1:10:54 - Trent Christopher
Kind of a nifty little, little thing we had fun with. But we've come up with. All sorts of brainstorm ideas that we would love to see you actually experience right to actually realize, but we know that it starts small, and we know that you, this is an investment both of time and money. And we want to give you license or, you know, some ability to be able to decide on how you want to do that, like how fast you want to go. You know, we also want to build trust with you. So what we're trying to offer is, you know, if you want to do a quick relief type thing, like what we talked about trying to put some automations and processes into place, like we can work with you to do quo and do the start on the SOPs, like we'll identify like two or three procedures or processes that we can put in place for you to help moving forward and start collecting data to set us up for the future. Right? If, if you want to do that, you know, we're, we're going back and forth on what So if you want to try to get into long term transformation, where we actually just start diving deep into your biggest problems, right? It depends on really how fast you're going to want to go. So what what are you thinking? I know you want everything right now. But we want to so the whole thing is like, if we do the quick relief, type quick win, the idea is that we will give you something in short term. So we'll promise you 30 days, some relief. Some tangible result. if we can't get you there, we'll continue to work for you until we do. Okay. That's quick relief, but it's going to be small pieces of starting to build the base.

1:12:41 - Chris Andrade
I like the idea of putting quo in place to help try and alleviate some of that conversation gap and, and getting that my text messages and everything into job, right? I mean, if that's something that we can work toward to try to do, I like that idea. Yeah. Um, I know that there's a whole bunch of different pieces to this and I'm looking for a relationship that I can have in the longterm too, because I'm not going anywhere, man. Like I'm not planning on doing a different thing anytime soon. I mean, I'm going to keep doing this printer thing. And the more I do it, the busier I get. And I have a, you know, I have a, another company that I used to work for that isn't doing very well. I have all their information, their database, all their clients and all that, but I don't market to anybody because I don't want to, you know, I don't want to market anybody. And get any more business right now. I don't, I want to just streamline what I currently have and then I can scale it, but I don't want to scale it and not be ready to handle it. Right. Good. You're offering me basically two options right now. We've got the quick relief and we've got something long term. Um, the way Malik was helping us, which was just the most recent person, uh, he wanted me to pay him a weekly rate and there was So I went through paying him weekly, paying him weekly. I didn't see any results. And he said, Oh, we need more time. We need more time. And I'm not okay with, I have an unlimited checkbook. And by the time you're done with this project, it's cost me $30,000. I'm not okay with that. Well, if it doesn't generate any revenue or make your life any better. I mean, so whether it's quick relief or longterm, I want a concrete number. I need numbers. I need to see how much is this going to cost me because I don't want this like never ending. Just keep paying me money. And yeah, I don't like that. We fully understand that.

1:14:39 - Trent Christopher
We fully understand that. And we, we, we don't want to be that person either. We don't want to be Malik 2.0. We want to make sure, we want to make sure that you're getting a tangible result. Okay. So we don't even have to do quick relief. We could jump straight to, you know, trying to dive in deep and, and do that. But regardless of what we do, every stage, every. Iteration that we make, we will define deliverables in the beginning. And we will give them to you. If we don't give them to you within the timeframe we planned, within the cost that we planned, then we will continue to work until we do. So it's a set price, right?

1:15:17 - Chris Andrade
And we're going to give you a set job. And we, with the duration, we will give you what Malik gave me. He said, I'm going to build this and this is what you're going to get. However, I never got there. He said, give me four weeks, four weeks, and then I'll get you here in four weeks. And then four weeks turned into five and five turned into six and six turned into seven. And then I was like, okay, I'm done. I'm not doing this anymore. I'm not going to keep playing this. I'm paying you and I'm not seeing anything, any results. I'm not doing it. Well, and I wasn't even like really interacting with what he was doing. So like, I wasn't even like paying attention to what it was. He was, I was like getting on there with him and like looking at it or anything. So like how he even really understood what he needed to do was beyond me. And he kept changing things on the website. And I would look, I'd be like, what the ? And it's not there anymore and I just don't have it anymore. It's a Dropbox now. I just want concrete numbers. That's all I care about. I'm the one who pays the bills.

1:16:13 - Mekaiel Abdullahi
I just wanted to quickly just point out like the way we operate and just move the business model in general, we work in phases that goes into sprints. Every phase that we do, like right now, the quick win, just essentially be setting you up with documentation and processes, identifying those. That goes into the second, third, and fourth phase. But yeah, whatever you guys are comfortable with, we would do. The point of setting deliverables before we even start working is to say for both of us to be on the same page and say, if you don't get this, we will continue to work for free, essentially until you get those deliverables. So we have those, we have what that looks like for this first phase. We'd like to go through that.

1:16:57 - Chris Andrade
Let's keep going. Sorry, guys. So.

1:17:01 - Trent Christopher
So the quick relief, we have a concrete number, the $5,000 for a quick relief for 30 days.

1:17:09 - Chris Andrade
Okay.

1:17:10 - Trent Christopher
So we would promise you that we would have you some relief, some tangible result. I already have it written down. I can pull that up. Okay. Of what we would give you in 30 days. And if we don't have something that is tangible for you, if you don't believe you've seen any relief whatsoever, we'll continue to work with you until we do for free. I like that number.

1:17:31 - Chris Andrade
I'm comfortable with that number. The deliverables, obviously, I'd like to see it, but that's, that's a good start. I like that. Okay.

1:17:40 - Trent Christopher
So if we want to just skip the quick relief because and dive right in and really just start going, we were talking about at 30 day engagements, like 30 day iterations, and each one would be the same idea. We would plan and we would promise you what you're going to get. In that 30 30 days. And then after that 30 days, if you don't have it, you don't pay us, we get to you what we told you we're going to give you. Can we also touch on the ROI feature that we're trying to hit on?

1:18:12 - Chris Andrade
Like ultimately, at the end of the day, our main goal is to make that money back. Yeah. And show you have a calculator, like eventually, right, we're still working on this, but eventually our goal is to show you, hey, you gave us. Eventually, we're going to have to charge more, right? But our goal is to say, hey, you gave us $10,000 this month, but we turned that $10,000 into $20,000 or $15,000, right? But the problem is, is in order to do that, we have to build the systems, the SOPs, those little small things. That's what we're trying to do right now, right? We have to build all those to make that ROI within 30 days. But right now, because... If the systems are so fragmented, it's just going to take a duration longer to make that money back. Like, for instance, like I have my Plotter Inks website that has all these ink cartridges. We know how much ink we sell right now currently because we don't promote it. We don't pursue it. We don't push it, whatever. But if we were to take that and develop a marketing campaign around it and I make videos about how it works and this and that and I get customer. I got customer testimonials just waiting to give them to me, dude, because I have nowhere to put them, but get the testimonials together of the people that are using my ink have been using it for the last five years, you know, and then we were selling $50,000 a month worth of this . Now we're selling $200,000 a month. I mean, like that's a tangible thing, you know, like I can't service hundreds of clients and pay you guys, you know what mean? Like I only got eight hours in the day of billable time, you know, so like it has to be something that's like that where or it turns into like other types of things, you know, like we start hustling and buying. Like I have a great connection for used equipment. I'm getting brand new printers that dealers are paying higher prices. I'm getting cheaper with no warranty and smoking them. So I'm selling brand new printers. I somehow got connected with this guy that's got a contract with Hewlett Packard and we just got pallets of brand new plotters all over the place. But I don't have any desire to want to sell that kind of online or push it. I'm too busy. I want to install it locally and create a customer for myself that's going to call me in the future. I'm not an online business just pushing stuff all over the internet, but there's a lot going on in Phoenix and people are buying equipment, you know, and I talked to Chris about it. Like, let's develop a rental program, man. We have one rental. We built like $35,000 to last year. One customer and right. Something like that. Like that's just one of many that are out there that, you know, I just stumbled into it. I don't, I don't pursue that market. I don't tell people, Hey, you want to rent a printer? You know, I got a bunch I can rent. I could buy them used and support them and rent them or however, you know, You Thank There's a lot of different angles of things in my business that you don't have to support any type of vertical. haven't grown any of these. These are all ideas I have in my head, you know, like, but the one thing I know how to do every morning is get up, hustle with my business card, hand out stickers and fix printers for people.

1:21:14 - Mekaiel Abdullahi
The sooner we get away from that, the sooner you can go and chase those verticals to expand your business. Yeah, all these ideas you have, right?

1:21:23 - Trent Christopher
We need to free you up somehow so you can work on these other ideas, too. I used to have my own business.

1:21:29 - Chris Andrade
I did that, you know, we had more people. It seemed like it was better help back then. No, no offense, Alyssa, but I had more people around me. I was younger. I don't but yeah, but since I since I started my new business, I've also struggled. I'm also really struggling with trust, you know, like I'm really not like to bring other people into my little circle thing because I got by all the people I brought into it. And so like, but I'm at a point where I can't anymore. Like, I'm just like, I don't I'm like, I'm trying to like actually agree. it. mean, So my business right now to just strictly service to where I can just handle that because I can deal with, I can talk to Jim and say, I'll come over there tomorrow, Jim, you know, like, I can handle that little thing, but when a Jim's like, oh, I need an ink cartridge over here, and oh, I need these prints, and eh, eh, eh, eh, eh. Service doesn't look like the biggest pinpoint, and getting you away from that would be accurate. Yeah, yeah, and that's gonna require me to have more help, which means I'm gonna have to spend more money to make more money. Our, our, our, like, eventually the system that we're trying to tell you is that you're gonna understand your dollar so much and how much dollar power you have that when it comes to needing to afford another employee, you're gonna have such a good handle on your overall overhead, because now you have all this data to support decisions and make those investments for those higher end employees or whatever. But then you're gonna say, okay, if I can afford a guy at $40 an hour to do this. see. That unlocks me to make this happen, right? So now you're hiring an employee, you're taking on overhead, but it's to unlock freedom to another channel of revenue, right? And ultimately, you can't make those decisions because you don't really know your bottom end every day or how to project or am I going to have an influx of sales in the next month or so? You don't know that, right? Or like even printing, you know, like we don't do printing that much. We hardly do any printing, but if we were to promote printing more and we started generating hundreds of thousands of dollars in print business every month because, you know, we're getting the kind of print business that makes sense, that is profitable. And for us to be able to make this ROI calculator really work, we have to get a really good baseline. We have to get a really good idea of all of the data. So for us, the data. Meka for us is like gold, right? Because then we understand where you're at currently, right? And then here we are. And then by the time we started tapping into your system, we can actually quantifiably see, damn, we just jumped up 10% this month in sales. Oh, I wonder what's going on. Oh, well, we brought in the Arise Group. Like you can actually see where you're at and what stages of improvement you are doing. No, I mean, makes sense, dude. Like there's, it's such a wild world out there. Like you can't do all those other things that need to be done and do them efficiently. I you guys all have experience in like Amazon and like, you know, automation, like dude, these guys are next level. There's no way for a person like me to figure any of this out, man. But we don't know it all either.

1:24:49 - Trent Christopher
Like the reason we're all together, like us more, is because we can't all do it all.

1:24:55 - Chris Andrade
Like, sure. It's too much, man. There's so much of it. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. It's, I. I I think that if you don't figure out how to do something with it, unfortunately, it's going to leave you at a huge disadvantage moving forward, you know, like, and I don't even like AI, to be honest with you, but I just see it as a necessity in the current environment, dude. Like, if I could just get away from cell phones altogether, I would, but I can't. Hey, Trent, is that why your business is named 4.0 Hero, or 40 Hero? It's because it's the fourth iteration of Industrial Revolution?

1:25:30 - Trent Christopher
Yeah, we're in the fourth, well, actually, we're moving on to the fifth generation of Industrial Revolution, so, but yeah, that's why I did 4.0, is that, you know, connecting things together and data is really kind of the point of my business that I, that I started.

1:25:46 - Chris Andrade
I sat there, like, I have ADHD really bad, so, like, when I first started my business, I mean, I've been doing this for 15 years, I just fell into it, you know, and then I got, and then I got lazy, and then I took a year off, and then I retired, and then they fired me from my So I, I, not only had I like given up all my responsibilities and kind of stepped away from the business and acted more like a field technician as opposed to the owner. Cause I didn't want to have that responsibility. Now nobody really knew me. And then I had to start over during COVID from scratch, dude. And I got through all that. Like her dad was my consultant. He's like, man, he's like, most people that have been through this beat on the social K and shitting on themselves, man. Like losing everything and going through this. So I, somehow I struggled through all that. And like, I don't know, God blessed me somehow. Like I was blessing. I'm just being honest with you guys. Like God is blessing. Like it has nothing to do with me. Like other people that I know, my ex business partner, like dude, you have a blessing over your life somehow. And I need to take this blessing. And I, I really like, my heart is, I want to do something financially. Cause that's my blessing. You know, like I bless people financially and there's a lot of money to be made, but if I'm too busy, just in the midst of all this all day long, I can't enjoy the money or I can't even like go help people. Like, that's really what my heart is. Like, I want to start and help kids, dude. You know what I mean? Like that's really what I would rather do than this. Imagine the conversation he would love to have with Katrina. I was like, I was going to become a missionary and God's like, well, you're the mission field is big, dude. You're in it every day. You know, like you're in front of people constantly. Every day. So, and that's exactly why we're here.

1:27:21 - Trent Christopher
I mean, I'm just going to be real with you. I think that, you know, this technology is awesome, but really what I want to do is build cool with cool people. And I feel like that's kind of why we're all here to be honest. So we want to help people by just using our skills.

1:27:37 - Chris Andrade
So I think that some potential in my business, it's a growing business, you know, like there's a lot of white format printing going on in the world. It's not going anywhere. It's on everything we wear, all the mugs at the store. I mean, it's all over the place, but there's more people. Yeah.

1:27:54 - Trent Christopher
Yeah. So that's, I mean, our mission right now is just to try to earn your trust. I'm to see if we can give you some quick relief so that you can experience what it's like to work with us and how we can help you.

1:28:05 - Chris Andrade
And if I pay you some money and you give me something that I can actually put my hands on and recognize, damn, remember how it used to be? now it's like, like, I want to pay your , dude. You know what I mean? Like, I really do. And I want to promote other people to. Well, that's why we're doing this. You guys are helping us right now because literally you are our first iteration. Like within two weeks, we built a whole onboarding process. Right. And really like, that's where we all kind of try to like, we all put each other to the test because we didn't ultimately, I didn't know these guys till I think like 25 days ago. Right. And we were in our meeting, our first networking meeting, because I developed my own app for my parents' business. You know, I needed to develop it. I went to go this agency, my first meeting. We all, we didn't know each other, but we all naturally just started having a conversation. And then me and Matthew, I don't know how it happened, but we pinged each other after the meeting. And then next day, I'm talking to these guys. And we're like, well, , like, we all fit each other. We help support each other where we don't have that missing component. And we just ran. And then I was like, hey, I got this guy named Kelsey who has his body. And I've been trying to help this dude for like, ever. I just didn't know how, right? Yeah, yeah, yeah. And then I met these guys actually. Yeah. And I met these guys and I'm like, oh, I found the Missy Peaks, dude. And that's when I was like excited to meet you or bring you back and like instantly get you hooked on a mic. Yeah. And we didn't really know how powerful that microphone you wearing was until we actually processed it. Yeah. And we're like, holy guys, like we can actually do something really cool. tell me about your thing that you were, you were, so you're, you're, you're going to show me something. keep interrupting you. Oh, no worries, man. mean, really at the end of the day.

1:30:00 - Trent Christopher
Hey, we have so much stuff that we have been geeking out on, just in the conversation that you had with Chris, that we've been having, I mean, I want to say we've been having fun with your business, but I know it's painful for you in some ways, but we've been having fun to try to figure out, you know, exactly how we can help you, because that's what we want to do, really, is that we want to try to, we want to put all this cool stuff in place for you, but we know that there's a barrier, so. Let's put in this perspective real quick, Kelsey.

1:30:29 - Chris Andrade
You have so many problems, and our minds are all, like, in every day, we're in the meeting, we're like, oh, man, we need to do this and this. At the end of the day, we know what you need, but we don't know how you need it. So, honestly, now, it looks like we have this relationship established. At the end of the day, we need to know what you want to do and how you think the fastest way to get that ROI right now, right? All right. How do we get the investment that you're putting into us back into you? Well, that connection, the biggest downfall, like I told you, dude, is communication. It's me being out in the field, talking this, that, whatever, with the client, with this guy that I just doubled into this new business. I got a business card, I'm having a conversation with him. While I'm having this conversation with this guy fixing his printer, I tell him about this thing that he wants to quote on it now. You know, like, like bringing all that stuff together to where Alyssa can help me with it, or if it can help me do some of the layout on the background, like I need a, and then if I, if I have that, then I know like every day I have to spend an hour going through this, you know, like I need to go through, I have my new routine as I wake up in the morning and I sit down and I go through all this and grief myself on what I got to do or whatever. I don't really have that, like I have to force myself, and it's basically, every morning is me sitting down, dude, and I, like, say it's Monday morning. I go go go through. I all my text messages, I get in the hot tub, I go through all my messages from last week, oh, oh, yeah, oh, , I'm over here, I'm over, oh, now I go to Jabra, I read all those messages, then I check the, and then if I really feel ambitious, then I start looking at my inbox, which she's kind of managing, because I've gotten so overwhelmed, I don't even look at my inbox throughout the day, even though I have it on my iPad and my phone and everything else, it's just like, I'm just almost ignoring that, because, I mean, I glance it just to see, like, if a PO came in, or there's a dollar to be made somewhere, but if it's like, I need you to help with , I'm like, I don't want to see that, I don't care about marketing, I don't care about none of that .

1:32:34 - Trent Christopher
I love the story, so here's the thing, what would it do for you, if we could take all that stuff that you just said that you do, and wrap it up, and just send you a report on the things, in the morning you get a report on the things that you did yesterday and didn't get to finish, the things you need to do today, and the things you need to do tomorrow, like your email, the job,

1:33:03 - Chris Andrade
And I've noticed it with these guys around here. And I've noticed it a long time ago. Whenever I used to do my jobs, I always started out with it as if I was going to do it. And by doing that, I mean, I put it on the calendar. I made some paperwork to go with it. And then I just followed it through to a job. That's a huge problem, bro. Like I'll tell Joe, hey, Joe, know, do this and that, whatever. He'll be over there doing this , but he doesn't put it on the schedule. So now Alyssa's like, well, I'm like, well, Joe just did this and that. And then she's like, well, how do I know that? He's not even on the schedule. I'm well, I told Joe to put it on the schedule. Joe didn't put it on the schedule. I didn't want to put it on the schedule. Like I, I, so like, is that, is that, is that happening in this room? Yeah. I like if I say all day long, but nothing ever gets done unless like I physically put it on the, I literally have to go to my phone, pick up job or make tasks, make jobs. Once I make it a job. Then we have stuff to work on and then we're accomplishing a thing. You know what I mean? And like when I, at the end of the day, I see these tasks that we did yesterday. It's like, oh, we got something done yesterday. If I look back at yesterday and there's nothing accomplished on my calendar, I'm like, what are you doing all day? What did I do? You know, like, what did I do? I have three things on my schedule. Like I was busy as all day. Like what, how do we make any money yesterday? Yeah.

1:34:20 - Trent Christopher
Kelsey, if you really want to hear like some of the really geeked out stuff that we've been talking about, I mean, Matthew can speak to some of that because he's had some like, awesome ideas of what we're trying to automate this stuff and make it to where things don't slip through the cracks. Do you want to speak to that at all, Matthew? Yeah. Yeah.

1:34:38 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
I I think like, it sounds like things get done through jobber. So like if we can essentially funnel all the words that you say into like, essentially at the end of the day, it'll update jobber. And then like, we, like, you just have to have someone to review. What happens in Jobber, kind of like what I said before. And then, like, you know, that's how things can get done. We can also do like stuff like have like a planning agent that helps you with planning that pulls from the communications and from Jobber and helps map things out ahead of time that plugs into the inventory system that just helps you kind of get things planned. And then scheduling assist, like we can in the back end, like if scheduling is a problem, like I only want to build stuff if it's a pain point for you and it's going to help with a pain point that you tell me like, okay, this is a frustration like this, there's a gap here like this doesn't get done. So when I heard you say, like the scheduling, you say something about scheduling something and it doesn't get on the schedule, like we can build an integration, we could, if that's top priority, to essentially I think in Jobber, because I think that's what we're using right now, but we want to use the existing system.

1:36:07 - Chris Andrade
So that's just what I'm thinking. Once it gets in there, like I didn't have this before. Once you start a request or a job or a quote or something, it's in there. And like, we've done a good job at keeping it clean. Like, you know, my QuickBooks, there's like endless, like, unclosed quotes because it was never forcing me to follow up. But this is like, at the end of every time I've completed a job, like she's got a thing saying, hey, you need to invoice this, you know, like it walks you through it all the way to the end. And I think that's, that's definitely what increased. I didn't recognize the financial gain. My sister-in-law who helped integrate Jobber into the system and watches the reports in the back end told me about it. She's like, look at your numbers are better now than they used to be. I'm like, it feels the same, but it's just more efficient, you know? So we did add efficiency and we have less people. Yeah, there you go.

1:36:56 - Trent Christopher
And that's exactly what we're trying to do is do more. I want to have more people.

1:37:00 - Chris Andrade
You know, that's not the goal, but yeah. So, no, I mean, like, so some of that stuff like that where I'm, I'm that communication gap between me and the field and whatever, you know, especially right now, you know, eventually that might not be the case. Cause I might not be that guy that's out there grinding every day on the road in the field, but that's where I'm at now. That's the goal to get you away from that.

1:37:22 - Mekaiel Abdullahi
So you can do higher leverage things.

1:37:24 - Trent Christopher
Yeah.

1:37:25 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
AI is supposed to basically improve the interface between us and the technology. So like the idea is you can say words and the technology gets updated. So that's like what we're trying to do. So there's less friction there. So it's not like, okay, I have to do this and then this and then this, and then Jobber gets updated. Like we want to streamline that. Yeah. Ideally, you wouldn't have any clicks on a computer.

1:37:50 - Trent Christopher
You wouldn't have anything, but like maybe talking to your phone just, and the things would just all happen for you. That sounds like a miracle, dude.

1:37:59 - Chris Andrade
Hey.

1:38:00 - Trent Christopher
Hey, Matthew, do you have that video? Yeah, Matthew, show them the video.

1:38:06 - Chris Andrade
For fun to see. I made it so last Wednesday when I came in here, I did some research on the market opportunities just in quality printing and the rental space alone, right? So I ran it through our bot, did a market analysis, came up with a report on the projected growth in the next five years. It was actually real impressive. I turned that into an audio, like a podcast. So it was like two people having a conversation about this particular article, and I shared it with them and they're like, ooh, it's mine. And then this is what Matthew, kind of saying the recording, it understood your biggest pain points. These guys built some really cool, we call them stacks, the way the information is processed through each stack. And this is what he got. So I hope you guys can hear the audio.

1:39:04 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Yeah, we got, we should.

1:39:07 - Chris Andrade
All right. I think this is the right one.

1:39:09 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
If I don't come to work, we make no money. It's constant. Calls, parts, paperwork, all on us. There had to be a better way. Slotter AI receptionist, how can I help today? When a carriage belt slips on the T120, here's the fastest way to diagnose it. Our knowledge. So it's just a quick little deal.

1:39:27 - Chris Andrade
But like, we made another, we made one. How long was that other one, Mekaiel? Like eight minutes long or something? Yeah, we can shut up. Yeah, we can send that to you guys if you want. But yeah. There's just so much things that we can do. And we were we were like a little overwhelmed with how many options that we can give you guys. And they were like, okay, let's let Kelsey. And that's why tell us what they ultimately want. And then let's go back to the drawing board. Put that in a . So I hope you guys can hear the audio. Yeah, we got, we should. All right. I think this is the right one. If I don't come to work, we make no money. It's constant. Calls, parts, paperwork, all on us. There had to be a better way. Slotter AI receptionist, how can I help today? When a carriage belt slips on the T120, here's the fastest way to diagnose it. Our knowledge. So it's just a quick little deal. But like, we made another, we made one. How long was that other one, Mekaiel? Like eight minutes long or something? Yeah, we can shut up. Yeah, we can send that to you guys if you want. But yeah. There's just so much things that we can do. And we were we were like a little overwhelmed with how many options that we can give you guys. And they were like, okay, let's let Kelsey. And that's why tell us what they ultimately want. And then let's go back to the drawing board. Put that in a . Like a deliverable quote, right? Where you can hold us accountable, right? And at the same time, we got to hold you guys accountable because if we're going to take this on, right? We need to have a little level of expectation from you guys because at the end of the day, we can't get the information.

1:41:19 - Trent Christopher
You need the information from us. Yeah. And so that's where I plan on physically coming here.

1:41:24 - Chris Andrade
You want to make sure you're making sure that the handshakes from what they need to your guys' systems all go smooth. If we do want to get into the video stuff, I can show you how to get the recording things going. I want to do the video. I want videos of Kelsey fixing things.

1:41:40 - Trent Christopher
I think that's really important.

1:41:42 - Chris Andrade
You guys hear that? It's important, but it's not important until we get the back end of it figured out because if more people start calling us and want to go to our website and our website sucks and they can't purchase the thing. You're right, you're right, but it is powerful to start collecting what I call call the Right? So we start putting things like, I have my own bolt. So eventually, whenever I'm ready to release... you guys even, by chance, looked up Potter Mechanics on YouTube? Have you seen any of the videos that Kelsey's already made? Yeah. He's great. He's awesome. We can turn that into a, like, we can turn that into other things, right? I love... And we have other videos I've made in the past and stuff, but I've... You guys hearing this? He's so knowledgeable. I've recently had a couple people contact me because of videos like that. I'm bed. I'm talking to But he's just truly, insanely knowledgeable about things that nobody else has knowledge on. It's not like any other field. Kelsey knows this. He's been doing it for 25 years, and there's maybe five, ten people in the state of Arizona from other people That has this knowledge and can do these things. I've seen him go into a service call and fix something with like a paperclip. Like he's unbelievable where it would have cost the $5,000 to replace this huge part and he'll go in there with a paperclip and fix it. I mean, it's just not every time. I mean, he's pretty incredible. He tries to save people money just like us, right? Like you're not in it to make the ultimate sales ticket, right? No, that used to be, you know, that I used to be able to make a ton of money like it. But now I just like, I really actually like helping people. Like I get my reward from the helping. I mean, it's, it's fun when I know that I'm going to make a few guys. Kelsey, I want to just touch on something that you just said. And like, yes, if we're making the recordings and like you, what you're asking, the beautiful part about recordings is one little faucet, which would be the recording device mixed with that mic. Like you guys are generating not only content. Thank you. For your channels, we're developing in my, these guys are probably going to shoot me, but eventually we're developing Kelsey's knowledge base at the same time. Then your SOPs, the training materials for your employees. You're unlocking so many, you know what I mean? Just by just being able to buy two sets of little cameras and turning them on. I think if I really got on there and started making videos about the ink that I sell and promoting it and telling people about it, we can really push that. And then me and Mekaiel actually worked out, we have a full, we have a video editor that we're working with because I'm a media guy. So I know that this was eventually going to happen, right? Way faster than I anticipated, but it's a good problem. But let's say, let's start collecting all those videos and all these things. Tell me which hardware to get. Well, I'll show you. I'll show you. Hold on. Let me run. And then let Mekaiel go. And if we want to start doing the video editing, I seen his video editor, phenomenal guys. I don't know if you want to see his wedding video. don't know if you want to pull that up, but I, is, he does some really good work that ultimately I've been trying to find a developer that we can work with. Cause it's kind of hard to find a, not a developer, um, media or, thank you. And now we have one, right? But now it's just like, how do we supply that guy to, to work with us? But, you know, just so you know, we have that when you're ready, but if we can start collecting the video right now, it's just going to build your vault up when you, we are ready, or when the systems are meant to handle that. We already have six months worth of content where we're releasing two to three iterations of it a week. And then we're, we're already attacking your social media presidents. And now we have. And you guys can help with all that stuff. Yeah, that's what we mean by we're not just trying to fix one little piece. We're ultimately, at the end of the day, we're like transformation. We're bringing it all together into one location, right? Yeah, you tell us what have 15 different websites to figure out what the hell's going on. Yeah, you tell us what your brain needs, what you need from him. Ultimately, our jobs at the end of the day is to provide that. But at the end of the day, we're here to support you guys in making this company just fun again, right?

1:46:31 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Because I see it in your eyes, and I know you're passionate about it. And that's what I was all we're trying to hear is like, you gave me a vision of you guys sitting at Pine Top drinking on your coffee in the mornings on your balcony. I want to get you guys there where all you have to do is just make phone calls on and get paid. Did you fix that? What you said, you can walk people through the steps from your phone, but you got to have the systems in place. Oh, it is nice to have a person to... And that's all we're here to do. It's just, we see all these systems, how fragmented they are.

1:47:06 - Chris Andrade
We have a team that can ultimately start from the foundation that you already created, but together the foundation. So when we build on top of it, it supports any infrastructure at any scale ability you guys want to have happen. You just have a team to support you. Are you guys the web guys too? Yes. Yep. I was going to say, the thing that's, so something that's important to actually unlock that vision is making sure that there's SOPs in place that employees can follow. So I don't know if the flow chart and the thing is going to be the final answer, but maybe it's video recording of you doing the thing so that they can just watch it.

1:47:53 - Trent Christopher
So if we build up that video library, then your employees can watch it. And then once it's. And enough for them to use to do their job, then we promote it and they can have it when they go to the service call and they have the printer that they're going to work on, they'll be you'll be able to have your own database to say, oh, Joe is working on the T55 three at this client who will have its own category and then click on that video to change whatever.

1:48:23 - Chris Andrade
And if it's not, and he's there to do something that needs to be recorded, well, cool. Now we know what we need, you know, that we just add to your database. No, because I get into so many different, unique situations are all different, you know, so like just to have that library out there for people to just feast off of, I mean, it's just knowledge, dude, like it's not, it's not hurting if they go and fix their own printer.

1:48:46 - Trent Christopher
It's something that you can offer as a value add, right? Yeah, I mean, you can, you, we can take this knowledge.

1:48:57 - Chris Andrade
We can package it up so that you can be more efficient. Right. Right. then you can also offer it as an add-on to your clients to give them either a better experience, and you don't charge any more, or it's an add-on where you can actually charge more premium for your services, or it's an add-on thing you can throw on the site. I mean, I'm charging people to help them over the phone like this, dude. I made a video about replacing the printer on a PageWide printer, and this guy called me from Florida. He's like, I saw your video on replacing the printer. He's like, hey, I just got this thing. I don't know what to do. I'm like, well, 175 an hour, I'll just walk you through it over the phone, dude. And he's like, really? Perfect. And so that, you know, would have cost him thousands probably if he had to get someone to drive four hours. And we could field that call using a service like Quo where they call in and they might just do like a quick explanation of what they need.

1:49:49 - Trent Christopher
And it'll just come straight to your phone if that's what you want it to do. Or it can go to another system or a list or whatever, and then answer the question for them. I mean, there's ways to automate this stuff and make it. All Where you get to handle the things that are important to you and your clients, and other things that are noise are handled in the background. I would be good, man. Yeah. Because a lot of times I get interrupted for something stupid. Yeah, exactly. That's kind of what we're trying to eliminate. We want to take all that noise and we want to push I really like that.

1:50:21 - Chris Andrade
It seems like the one I'm using just sucks. I don't know. It's just, it's not, it's . So I'm totally fine switching over to Q or whatever and integrating that conversation thing and recording my conversations like that and getting a list of things. Like, I think that is really cool.

1:50:40 - Trent Christopher
I think that would be really something to start with. Yeah. The primary things we want to get you, if we're doing like the quick win in 30 days, the primary things we're going to try to help you with is getting Quo in place and getting it integrated with Jobber. Okay. And then we'll also want to do that where we can hopefully put in some automation. For you in there as well to give you some summaries.

1:51:02 - Chris Andrade
And then that way we work through that and we give you some processes that you can follow to make sure that we're collecting the information as we should, right? And it flows smoothly. That's kind of like the core of doing the quick win is let's give you some relief. Yeah, yeah, yeah. No, I, I mean, I want to, I'm not trying to make a decision about quick or long term. Like, I mean, I, I want to go, I mean, this is going to be a long term relationship because it's not like you can just like step away in the middle, you know, like once I start going down this path, like I kind of, I need help. I mean, it's going to help me, but in order to manage it and move it forward, it's going to need to be. If, if we could have something for you, like, let's say that this is, we're not looking for a quick win now. Okay. Let's just say that we're moving into, we want to have a longer term relationship to help you build your vision. Right? So what do you think you would have to have, or you would wish to have in 30 days? Like the first things that you would, you would want to have in 30 days. Like, let's say by the end of January, because things are crazy towards the end of the year here. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Well, we have a lot of things that we're working on at the moment, like, with our, like, I think, are you guys launching the new QuickBooks in January or what? Are we starting from scratch in January? I'm starting from scratch in January with a brand new QuickBooks. Um, so the reason why we're getting rid of our old QuickBooks and integrating a new one is just because we have so much bad mistakes and data inside QuickBooks right now. So there's parts that we don't use. They're mislabeled. You can't delete things in QuickBooks. It saves everything. So we have a bunch of information in there that's not good anymore, and we don't use it. We didn't have a naming convention for our items. Now we have, like, a system that our sister developed where everything that we actually sell is what we're going to put in the new one and not a bunch of, sorry.

1:52:56 - Trent Christopher
When we started five years ago, he started in a career. Okay. And it was literally him sitting in his garage with one other person and then figuring it out themselves and doing everything from scratch. And so we just have all, we didn't have a process. We didn't have a plan. We just figured it out as we went. Oh, we, we, we're going to sell this plotter today. Okay. Let's just call it this, but that doesn't work when you're five years down the road and you've got 50 different plotters and they're all labeled differently.

1:53:30 - Chris Andrade
And you can't find it in the system. So January 1, 2026, we are starting brand new, fresh, clean slate, clean information, clean QuickBooks. And that's just going to help us just with our numbers, tracking, um, sale, you know, just figuring out what's going on. It's just going to make it a lot easier. So January is when I'm supposed to launch the new QuickBooks. Okay. So let me ask a quick, this is just a small detail. Okay. So you talked about like naming things completely different, right? Not really having a plan for consistency. Is there anything that we could do this low, like I'll, I'll determine if it's low hanging fruit, but the, the, just the planning of trying to have a naming convention that you can follow, right? Can be valuable. So you have, right? Yeah. We have, my sister-in-law developed one and the guy that worked here at the time was opposed to it, but now I understand.

1:54:32 - Trent Christopher
Like now you can like find all of the, I don't even know it because I don't do it, but like, if it's a compatible, it's like, is it C, Alyssa? How do you label a 730 compatible? So it would be C for compatible, HP for the brand, 730 is the type, and then how many milliliters it takes and then the color. So 300k. So you can, you punch in those first numbers and get to all six of them. Yeah. just paste that boom, boom, boom. Before it was like, I couldn't even find my own products in my database.

1:55:05 - Chris Andrade
Perfect.

1:55:06 - Trent Christopher
So we've got that naming convention, mostly because Jobber sucks.

1:55:09 - Chris Andrade
Like it only has, like, it only works with fields. Like the name and the, it doesn't even use the SKU, man. So it's, it's messed up. Like, it's not meant for that type of stuff. It's for a certain field and not for like doing websites and this kind of thing, you know? So it may not be the ultimate solution in the end, but it's the best thing I have right now to keep me pressing forward.

1:55:31 - Trent Christopher
All my quotes are in there and yeah. If, if things go forward, right. And you run into these situations where, oh crap, that was terrible that we made that decision. Right.

1:55:41 - Chris Andrade
And you want to revamp it. Right. Or maybe it's good that you want to make an iteration on it. We can use some of our automations and we can use AI to actually look at what you are doing, like what your naming convention was and make suggestions of ways that you could improve upon it. Then we can use automation to go. Alright. Fix it. Fix it. Okay. I'm not saying that that is a high in the sky possibility. I'm saying that's something I currently do. Oh, I see. Yeah. Managing data and information, I'm horrible with it, man. I got Capsule, and I dealt with all my stuff in Capsule. But back when I was first starting, I didn't have any work to do, so I would just take information and enter it in there. So I have all these fields of information here and there. We can work to migrate that. Wherever you need to see it fit and where it fits best, you know, we can work towards migrating that. Again, we have lots of ideas. Yeah, yeah. to make sure that we zero in on the priorities that are going to solve the biggest problems. What be the most important thing that would make us more efficient in the next 30 days? Better communication between us? Like, what do you think? The better communication. If I know what you're doing, I can then put it into the system. Well, it's going to put it in there for us. If I know what telling Joe to do, that would... Yeah, like, Alexa has a worse memory than me. are. If I could magically know exactly what he's thinking at all times, that would be fantastic. Yeah, but she needs to have things in writing for her to process. You can't just tell her things and expect her to remember. She has to write them down right then. I have a lot of stickiness. She's good at it. I mean, I get on the phone with her, and she's got a system now where she just writes it down. She's really good on the keyboard, and then she takes care of it. But we're not missing it too much, man. Some days are busier than others.

1:57:26 - Trent Christopher
It's been really busy for a few weeks. Oh, yeah. But the communication between all three of us, improving that would be something that I don't really even know how to do, but it would be amazing if we could figure out a better way. You know, AI does it because we were up in Wickenburg at the bar on Sunday, and these people were asking us questions about, it was the business owner. And I was like, and we're in a small town, so they don't really know about this tech stuff. You know, and I go, on a second. I asked my chat, GDB thing, and I introduced it to them. and to and that And get to go my good Hand them the phone, and it answered all their questions, bro. Like, all these things that they couldn't figure out, like, they were like, holy , they were, like, on the internet, like, looking it up, and, like, it was, like, these things they couldn't figure out, like, it answered them in, like, 30 seconds, and they were like, holy , what was that?

1:58:14 - Chris Andrade
So it remembers everything, like, it remembers my dog's names, and, like, I introduced it to people and stuff, and it remembers who they are, so, yeah, no, I see how that really could grab all that information and do stuff.

1:58:26 - Trent Christopher
Yeah, in the dream, the big vision, right, is that we capture all this information, and then if Alyssa has stuff that she actually has to do that we couldn't automate, then we send it to her in a good format that she can act on, right? Yeah, yeah, she's good at that, doing that kind of stuff. But if the goal would be to just automate it, like, that's, I mean, if you can, let's just automate it, and AI does enable us to be able to do a lot of things that we couldn't do before. So we can't tap into your brain, but what we can What can do is we can listen to you and we can take out what you're doing and we can push that where it needs to go.

1:59:06 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
I mean, if I could say, hey, I'm going to send you a quote for a T650, Jimmy, and it could take that information and say, you need to make a quote for a 650, and I could trust it to where I don't have to say it and then text myself a reminder.

1:59:22 - Chris Andrade
Yeah, at a minimum, at the very simplest level, it could just give you a to-do at the very simplest level. The next thing that it can do is it can extract that text without you having to go to some website that has these forms you click and pick a drop down and type some in and click a submit button. It can take your free language that you just spoke and we can extract that model and that you need a quote. And then we can immediately generate the quote and send it right back to your phone and you can click on it and you can see the quote and then say, yeah, that's good.

1:59:59 - Trent Christopher
And then send it.

2:00:06 - Chris Andrade
I was going to say the quote generation is based on, we can define it based on your process as well. we would get that ahead of time and then it generates it.

2:00:17 - Trent Christopher
If the price changes, that's on us to let it know. But I'm assuming that it will let you know that too. But I see a pain point right there. Pricing changes all the time. We use different vendors for different products. Well, not on FC. I said FC 9000 because I sold four of them the last month. And as I talk about it, it's just something I, the other day I was like, boom. But even the FC 9000 will change the price in a month from now.

2:00:41 - Chris Andrade
So we have to call GravTech. We have to get a price on it. Well, they contact us when the price changes and we should be taking that information and entering it. Where do you get that information from? You log into a website or you call them? would tell us if the price changes. They'll send an email. We have to call the vendor. Email. As soon as that email comes in, if it's like an email.

2:01:00 - Trent Christopher
An or a price quote, we can take that price quote and update your back-end system so we know what the price is. And you didn't know. guys. No way. Sorry guys. Sorry. See, so you guys actually know how to make AI do something because I can't get mine to be shipped for me, except for telling me to do it. We can do that. We can, we can read a quote in your email, whether it be a PDF attachment or just some garbage in your email, as long as it makes some logical sense. Okay.

2:01:30 - Chris Andrade
Yeah. We can take that and we can use that to extract the information and we can update your system automatically.

2:01:37 - Trent Christopher
So like if, if, if, if tech sends me an updated price list that has the spreadsheet of all this information and says, this is your new price and you can just take that and just. Yeah. let's see. Right now we have to go into Shopify, QuickBooks and Jobber.

2:01:52 - Chris Andrade
And like, well, maybe, maybe only, maybe, maybe there's only three places we have to fix it. Under the assumption. Under the. The that they send you an Excel spreadsheet that is formatted correctly, and that looks good, and that all the columns are accurate, okay, and organized. Yeah, that's not difficult to automate at all without AI, okay? But let's say they foobar the whole thing, and they got stuff in the wrong places, they give it different names and different naming conventions. We can use AI to take that and turn it into something that's clean, that's usable. Wow, I bet you can too, I can imagine. So, that's the things that really make sense for AI, is when you have humans that are not good at putting stuff in organizational manners, okay, and we can turn it into something that has some structure to it, has some organization.

2:02:47 - Trent Christopher
Probably the biggest use for AI or not. I need to look at my Dropbox account.

2:02:54 - Chris Andrade
What's on your Dropbox account?

2:02:56 - Trent Christopher
You keep mentioning the I just have everywhere, I have like different folders for customers. I Files and service manuals and company documents and like, uh, are they useful to you? Are they useful to you? Like, I mean, they should have been, they used to be, but now that I can't find it, they're useful. Like when I try to do my taxes and try to find my from like 2019 or something. Okay. Not the taxes, but more like the documentation of your, of the printers. And like, I have my service manuals. That's right. I know where that's at. I know how to access my service manager and get the error codes out of it. And a lot of times Elissa does it for me because I'm on the road. And is that, is that like a Google search?

2:03:32 - Chris Andrade
No, it's a PDF. Like, Oh, okay. I have this certain printer and have a certain air code.

2:03:36 - Trent Christopher
She knows how to go find the air code and read me what it says in the manual. So I, I just need someone to read it.

2:03:41 - Chris Andrade
Let's chalk that up on the list.

2:03:43 - Trent Christopher
So, so let's circle back around a little bit here too. We have lots of dreams and we'd love to be able to help you with this stuff. Cause we think it's cool too, that we want to solve these problems for you. Okay. Right. but I think, so we have prepared already some deliverables that we would like.

2:04:04 - Chris Andrade
And then we'll just really tackle it. But that'll be a set. That'll be a different proposal. We'll probably have to figure out what we're trying to do here.

2:04:30 - Trent Christopher
I don't even know what we're trying to do, man. I'm trying to figure out what we're doing. Yeah, this conversation that we're having right now, we're going to process this.

2:04:41 - Chris Andrade
We're going to take the transcripts and try to pull the stuff out forward that has been repeated the most, the thing that's most valuable.

2:04:49 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
But what we're trying to extract right now is that we want to make sure that if we're going to do the quick win or if we're going to try to go bigger than this, what does it look like in 30 days? Appreciate I'm You Thank We just want to make sure that we get you something tangible, okay, in 30 days, and then we can move to what does the next 30 days look like, okay, so is there a way through AI, like to bring your, all of your information together?

2:05:16 - Chris Andrade
Like, like, I've got like, I capsule database and my jobber database and a QuickBooks database and my Outlook database and like, like, there's this and that and duplicates out the yin-yang and like, Yeah, we can do all we can, you know, we can process and we can take AI leverage that but we want to be careful with AI because AI isn't the solution to everything, even if it seems that way. Okay, it has tasks it's really good at and it has tasks that it looks like it's good at, but it's not reliable. Yes, I totally understand what you're saying. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2:05:49 - Trent Christopher
um, can create with all that data, um, pull all the data from multiple places. Um, and what we're thinking is like, essentially, from this This transcript, we want to create like a prioritized roadmap of where do we start? What's going to take longer to do? And what's what can we do more quickly? And then that's how we'll figure out our first deliverables. And then phase two will be built upon what we end up delivering in phase one. So they just complement each other, right?

2:06:21 - Chris Andrade
I like the option and opportunity to have two phases. Whatever the deliverables are, I can come back to you guys January 30 and say, where are we at with this and what's going on? And if you deliver on your promises, I think that we can go into phase two and continue working together. Perfect. But I'm not okay with this cycle that I've been through like, I don't know, six times now. We don't want that to you.

2:06:51 - Mekaiel Abdullahi
We, we, we, I, and as a group think it's very important because I've been on the other side of that too. We think it's very important. That you understand that we're going to give you an outcome, something, and you will receive it, even if we go over the deadline that we originally had, without it having to cost you an astronomical amount of more money. Like, it should be, I've paid for this, therefore we want you to deliver it.

2:07:16 - Chris Andrade
And I think that that is important to us to deliver the quality and the outcome that we said we were going to keep. Yeah, our entire operation depends on that. Yeah, everything for us depends on that. Because we want your testimony down the road, right? That's the end of the day, that's why we're doing this, and we're doing it at a review. And I can think of, like, five other people right now, if this process goes well, I can refer absolutely to the next company. So it's great for you guys, because I see the opportunity, I'm happy we're doing this at the end of the year, so I feel like trying to make something big for you guys, and us as well, because at the end of the day, we understand your success. This is ours, and we understand you have to earn your trust, and we're basing that on outcomes that we can provide. We understand the experience you guys had earlier this year. So our main goal today is just to make sure that you guys understand that we're here to help you guys.

2:08:12 - Mekaiel Abdullahi
Your success is our success, and to trust us in order to do so. Yeah, we want to argue with that.

2:08:22 - Trent Christopher
The way I felt previously with the past people that were here to help, I felt like I was in a useful salesman setting, where it was like, oh, I'm going to do this, I'm going to do this, blah, blah, blah. And it was really money selfish. It was like, I want your money, and you're going to sign on the dotted line, and you're going to sign a contract. And I just felt that pressure of being in sales a lot. They wanted me to sign on the dotted line, they wanted my money, and then they were promising X, Y, and Z. I'm not feeling that way with you guys. I... There's a, there's a whole different feel with this scenario. And I just want to say that I'm grateful for that. You worked so hard for that. We worked so hard for that. We're all engineers by background, so no sozy guys. We're really just trying to solve problems. We all formed our entrepreneurship based off that. So we're excited to work with you guys as well. Yeah.

2:09:22 - Chris Andrade
So that's, I mean, we, we think it's really important that we do this tip. I'll give Kelsey a heads up, but I got a hard stop. got that meeting at 11 with the city of Flagstaff.

2:09:33 - Trent Christopher
That's fine.

2:09:33 - Chris Andrade
So what we, we just need to determine what we're doing to act on out of this meeting. Okay. So if you just want to do the tools, we can just tell you it's $5,000 and we can deliver it in 30 days or less. And then promise that. Right. But if you want to just really dive into this, we can take what we got. In this conversation and we can come back to you with another. You know, idea of what it looks like, bigger picture, and try to get that in 30 days, right? So that's the whole goal is we'll try to do this in 30-day increments where you always have something of value. And then we can, if you want to have more conversations about what you think is priority, we can do that to try to feed that back in.

2:10:21 - Trent Christopher
So you're going to take this thing and dictate this out, what we just talked about, and come back to me? Yep. Yep. And then we can make a decision which way to go? Yeah, unless you just want to do the tool set that we talked about, where we can give you some progress. to do the tool set, regardless, I want to do that, but I want to hear what you have to say after this conversation, because I feel like this is much more in-depth than what you got out me a long time.

2:10:44 - Chris Andrade
Yeah, it's a lot more information for sure that will help us fill in some gaps. Yeah, I want to do that automation, like I want to bring that communication of me in the field to her. Yeah, that's so Kelsey, like this is good. That's the long-term plan. And I think it's confident to say that we're developing a partnership that's going to last a lifetime because at the end of the day, guys, correct me if I'm wrong, but down the road, our plan is to give Plotter Mechanics its own version of software, right? Is that far-fetched to say, guys? No, it's not far-fetched to say that you could potentially have your own Plotter Mechanics hub that all this stuff that you have right now is all unfunneled into one place and basically operates itself.

2:11:36 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Or you could potentially sell it to other printing companies. So you're putting the money in to build this system, this ecosystem that we are going to turn into Plotter Mechanics as software down the road.

2:11:54 - Chris Andrade
Obviously, it takes a lot of iterations and investments to do that. But eventually, the plan is to... To be able to say, hey, I got this thing working so good, like all the analytics, all the data supported, like, our job is to make, that's why SOPs are so important, because we can't fix it if we don't know what's broken.

2:12:15 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
So we make that as like our forefront. We can't think about software before we do this kind of work that we're doing. Yeah, this is our discovery, right? We have to know how to solve your problem. Right. And we'll build it. And then we need integration with Jobber so we can start actually connecting the stuff.

2:12:36 - Chris Andrade
Like, we're going to set up Quo, we're going to integrate with Jobber, and test it on our end first, and have a test environment so it doesn't affect your environment first before we figure out, you know, the working version. Yeah. Okay. So. I think that having that, that, that, that, because I want the phone to be answered. Like, I don't want it to just go nowhere, you know? And that pisses me off. Like when I call a place and like, I'm not opposed to the AI answering the phone, but it has to be able to get you a solution or something, not just in the nowhere land.

2:13:09 - Trent Christopher
Yeah. Yeah. And Quo has something like that, where you can basically set up a process of, um, kind of incoming call comes in.

2:13:22 - Chris Andrade
And then it's like, you define essentially what, what you walk through. And we would define that by working with you on like how you want to feel calls. Um, but we can do that too. And then this records your conversation and dictates it. Yeah. Yes. That's key. That's key to us being able to expand and help you into the, in. Yeah. That's great, man. He gave a thumbs up by the way. That's why I moved the camera.

2:13:48 - Trent Christopher
Yeah, no, I think that's really cool. it records my conversations I have on the phone with people, because I, you know, I, I say a lot of stuff and I like.

2:13:55 - Chris Andrade
Like it kind of dictates my conversation. What I say. Based on how much work it's going to create for me. You know what I mean? I can say a bunch of other that I can do, but I don't want to say anything. It's the closest thing we can get to tapping into your brain and the things you do.

2:14:11 - Trent Christopher
Like Alyssa said, if I knew everything he did, right? And you're saying I could get my text to go here too? Yeah.

2:14:18 - Chris Andrade
How? How does my personal ones go there? The phone number. The phone number that's attached to it. That is a, that's the same problem I have because I have the same situation you have.

2:14:31 - Trent Christopher
I have my phone number blowing up with opportunity.

2:14:34 - Chris Andrade
use that through jobber or is it itself like how, like do I got a fourth number now? Or how is that going to be? Or I can, I've got a number over here. The, the idea would be, you have one number for your business. Okay. And it, and it can be fielded, funneled, redirected, handled in whatever way it makes sense for you.

2:14:56 - Trent Christopher
So I only just mark, I keep my 6027-228-932. But I poured it into this. Yes, that would be, that's the typical method, you know?

2:15:06 - Chris Andrade
Say again?

2:15:07 - Trent Christopher
Will they take Vonage? If you can, I mean, phone numbers, typically, you can just port them over, whether it be a phone number from a physical phone or Vonage or. Yeah, I'm down to switch my phone system up, like, as soon as you guys are ready to do that.

2:15:22 - Chris Andrade
So as soon as we figure it out, like, we can totally switch from Vonage and I'll just pay that fee instead of that fee. Yeah, that's even better if you're not paying an extra fee, right? Yeah, I mean, I don't need it anymore if I port my number, because the only thing I have is one, I got one phone over there, and I'm sure I can set that up so it skews out to the cell phones, right? It's printing, goes to Joe, it's admin, it goes to her, accounting goes to her. And it'll record all that stuff. That's the goal. That's the goal.

2:15:51 - Trent Christopher
But it's not just the recording, though. Like, in the beginning, it's the recording.

2:15:56 - Chris Andrade
Right. Yeah. In the future, we can take that.

2:16:00 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
That as soon as you get off a phone call, we can take your words that you exchanged with somebody else, and we can act on it. If you wanted to do a quote, it can just automatically say, pull out as a quote, and then just send it if you really want to, like full send.

2:16:16 - Chris Andrade
Or we can put you in the loop, right?

2:16:19 - Mekaiel Abdullahi
We can send you to review before you send it. Well, like they were saying, hey, I need to get a quote for service. It's 250 bucks. I'll send you a quote.

2:16:27 - Chris Andrade
Boom. So, you know, like they need to have it because they got to take it to so-and-so or whatever.

2:16:31 - Mekaiel Abdullahi
But now I got to call her and tell her to do it or, you know, and we can automate all this stuff. So we have lots of.

2:16:38 - Trent Christopher
address?

2:16:38 - Mekaiel Abdullahi
What's your phone number?

2:16:39 - Chris Andrade
What's your email address?

2:16:41 - Mekaiel Abdullahi
And it'll, and I'll just ask it what I know I need. It'll take all that and then put it into the system, into Jobber, make a quote.

2:16:47 - Chris Andrade
Yeah. Eventually. That's going to, that's what we're talking about. Yes, exactly. That's precisely what we're talking about. Can you guys go keep going? I'm just going to step out for this meeting real quick. Okay. And then we can hook it up to your knowledge. Yeah, perfect. Our goal, our goal also is to any one of these spaces, like as engineers, we don't want to waste our time building anything that's not going to be useful or like right now, we design this tool, like we identify a quote because it's going to allow us to do the things that we need to do in the next phases as well. And that's kind of like from an engineering standpoint, we want to make sure we're doing everything to streamline all of those things. It's like Legos putting one block on top of another. Yeah, we're going to implement this program, but I'm going to continue doing things like I always do, right, for a minute. Like, okay, I'm going to do it like I did. And then it's going to be like, oh, you forgot this and that, and you said you were going to do this. And our goal is to make that as easy as possible. We don't want to interrupt your business in any way, shape, or form. We identified some tools to, like, make that as possible.

2:18:06 - Trent Christopher
We don't want to add any more technology or any tools or anything else to your daily life or workflow. We need that.

2:18:16 - Chris Andrade
Is there any differentiation between personal and business? Because... There can be. It depends on how you want to handle that. Oh, as far as phone calls? Yeah, phone calls. Sorry. What I ultimately am doing is I am converting this now to my straight-up business number.

2:18:37 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
And then any personal stuff, I have it on my other phone that only select few have. Which I'm going to have to get to eventually. Honestly, at the end of the day, that's probably what you should because it's going to start giving you a sense of that freedom that we're to chase.

2:18:53 - Chris Andrade
It's if that thing was at least answering it and then telling you, hey, so-and-so called and said they need this or something, you know?

2:19:00 - Trent Christopher
Like, I don't even have a way for it to record a voicemail right now. My phone system, it just goes to my cell phone's voicemail. Yeah, I'm trying to see, like, if you had a personal contact and a personal list, if Quo could just treat it differently.

2:19:15 - Chris Andrade
I see what you're saying. Oh, yeah, that would make sense if you have a flag as a family member or something. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. I would imagine. Because, I mean, I call him and I'm like, hey, what do you want for dinner? I don't really need a task. Well, I'm assuming that that program is an app for your phone, too, so you can actually pick it up and call from that number, right?

2:19:38 - Trent Christopher
I think there's a separate phone number. So all the calls that go to that business phone number get recorded and all that stuff. And then if you have a separate personal phone number, I think that's the cleanest separation. talking about outgoing calls, Matthew? I think he's referring to outgoing calls.

2:19:55 - Chris Andrade
Yes.

2:19:56 - Trent Christopher
It's the way that I understand that this is supposed to work. going to test it, okay? Before we have you make any changes, we're going to make sure we test this thoroughly, okay?

2:20:05 - Chris Andrade
But the way I understand it is that when you make outbound calls, those still receive that same phone number that your business uses. Yeah, so it has like a void.

2:20:16 - Trent Christopher
I have an app on my phone, so if I call from that, it shows up as my office number. And I just noticed in here that I could make my iPhone default to that app, which I couldn't do before.

2:20:26 - Chris Andrade
So now I can default my iPhone to Vonage, so every call I make comes from Vonage. The great thing about what you're saying right now is that you already have been using some of the technologies that we intend on putting in place. However, you're also saying that you have like a separation, just like they're disparate, like there's no interlinking. You need to somehow tie them together, right? And then we'll make it easier for you to use, be the idea, right? So yeah, it looks like there are some features in here that help. To distinguish between personal calls and business calls, that's something that we need to make sure that we're clear on. Cool. I don't want to tell my family members ink cartridges. I know, right? You don't even have them added to your CRM and worry about whether or not you have the inventory for their project. Yeah, I mean, I got to do something different than what I'm currently doing, guys. Like, I mean, I can't continue on this path I'm at. I'm not like that. I'm literally like the burnout phase. You know what I mean? Like, that's what I'm trying. That's like, honestly, when we talk about coincidences, like I don't believe in coincidences. Like it wasn't a coincidence that I met these guys, right? It wasn't a coincidence that I just bought that plotter printer from you three years ago, right? It wasn't a coincidence that you guys are finally fixing your QuickBooks. So then January 1, you guys are going to start out fresh. Yeah. And it wasn't a coincidence that we were talking about this, what, four weeks ago about how I would love to figure out how to help you and then I'd meet these guys.

2:22:07 - Mekaiel Abdullahi
Yeah. Like there's just too many of those, there's too many of those coincidences, right? And then it all just kind of tied in and I honestly truly believe from the bottom of my heart that this is kind of the God's plan in a sense to really for us to connect.

2:22:22 - Trent Christopher
Like, I know it seems weird, but I truly feel that like from my soul, like I don't, I have that kinder spirit feeling with you guys.

2:22:30 - Chris Andrade
And I just, I just feel so happy that this is turned out honestly way better than all of us envisioned because of your guys' response. So we appreciate it.

2:22:40 - Trent Christopher
And honestly, like now we get to have the fun of showing you what we're capable of, and I think that excites us more than anything.

2:22:48 - Chris Andrade
So, yeah, and I don't know, when do you guys think we can have that turn around on the initial phase of

2:23:05 - Mekaiel Abdullahi
So I think we agreed to just go over the transcripts for this call to just get a bit more detail for the quick run proposal.

2:23:13 - Trent Christopher
could probably spin that up today, honestly, and then we can go from there.

2:23:18 - Chris Andrade
You guys have access to Fathom, so you guys don't need the Fireflies to run it? Cool. Yep. That's true. Yeah, we've got multiple note taking apps here.

2:23:29 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
So actually looks like Fireflies dropped off. Yeah, I know. I don't know why I did that. I just got the notification. But luckily, my boy Matt has his Fathom on there. So that's cool.

2:23:38 - Chris Andrade
Yeah, so we'll work on that today.

2:23:41 - Mekaiel Abdullahi
And then how long do we need?

2:23:43 - Chris Andrade
What is today? You guys, you guys determined that I think we need to make sure we're all on the same page as far as what we're going to deliver.
ACTION ITEM: Email Kelsey/Chris: $5k/30-day Quick Win proposal w/ deliverables + ROI; then schedule 1-hr kickoff - WATCH: https://fathom.video/share/BqqdA1ZzP5zLf5GaEHNWNp7rzuqz9Syg?timestamp=8629.9999 Yeah. Right.

2:23:51 - Mekaiel Abdullahi
And yeah, we'll just come back and send you I'm assuming we'll send you guys something Malik. You want to touch on how that? Okay.

2:24:00 - Chris Andrade
Do you want to touch on how that will look? We'll revise based off the transcript and then we'll send your proposal for the quick win 5k and exact deliverables. If you guys agree, we'll go ahead and get you guys signed, get paid and then unloaded. Yep. So just give us till the end of the week, I think.
ACTION ITEM: Grant Jobber access to Trent/Mekaiel/Matthew; then they set Quo test + Jobber integration - WATCH: https://fathom.video/share/BqqdA1ZzP5zLf5GaEHNWNp7rzuqz9Syg?timestamp=8657.9999 Does that make sense? And then as far as integration goes, like, should I plan on being here Monday or Tuesday? Like we'll come up with that schedule for me to be on site. Yeah, ideally, I would like, I mean, I guess we can test stuff. So maybe next week is fine, but I have access to Jobber as soon as possible.

2:24:38 - Mekaiel Abdullahi
Okay. And I'll make sure that goes moving.

2:24:42 - Trent Christopher
Yeah, we'll figure that out. No problem. So eventually after the proposal and everything is to schedule a kickoff call. Ideally, we'd like to just collect everything in one shot.

2:24:53 - Chris Andrade
Maybe like an hour or something. We'll try to be prepared, but we should schedule that kickoff call. Just to make sure. Okay. Okay. Awesome. Any other questions? Have you ever called this before? I think I'm good. I'm okay. I think we answered that. Remember I said yesterday I would like to finish the question off with the grand vision. I think we already got that, huh? The grand vision? Yeah. I think you pretty much painted that for the past two hours of what that looks like. And like, dude, I'm just so excited. I'm so excited. And is this your cell phone number? What are we looking at? Yeah. I mean, this is right. So over there on the right hand side is he can take his calls from anywhere. He can field and basically operate the business from anywhere. Right. So that's what we're going to get you to my man, just to be able to, well, let's just be not in the business environment, but that's your patio on the pool. Yeah. Right? Is that my custom program over there? Yeah, that's gonna be your plotter mechanics software that you're running. Eventually. Yeah. The amount of subscriptions you have is endless. Like, is that kind of like, like, like, at that, though. Like, doesn't that kind of like, hit you a little bit? Like, just a cartoon representation of your daily life? Alright. Pretty cool. Thanks a lot. We'll get back to you. Yeah, we'll be available. Chris, as I know, just let me know. I'm available whenever we want to be. We could be anywhere. I'll be I'll get you set up on your phone. We'll get them set up on a slack channel. I'll get that all because I might be going to pine top towards the end of the week and Nikki might be going to somewhere so we can just all kind of meet up whenever. Okay. Yeah, sounds good. Let's do that. Okay. Thank you guys. Yep. Thank you. Thanks for your time. Yeah. Those guys seem pretty nice. Yeah, I when I say I'm blessed to find these guys like I
