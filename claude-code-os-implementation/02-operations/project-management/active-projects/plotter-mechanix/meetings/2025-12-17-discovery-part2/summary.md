Meeting Purpose

To define a partnership for automating Plotter Mechanics' operations.

Key Takeaways

- The Problem: Plotter Mechanics is bottlenecked by its owner, Chris Andrade, who is overwhelmed by daily service calls, preventing focus on high-value growth initiatives like large-scale film cutting contracts.
- The Solution: Arise Group AI will implement a "Quick Win" phase, starting with the Quo phone system. Quo will centralize communications, transcribe calls, and automate data entry into Jobber, freeing Andrade from manual tasks.
- The Agreement: The initial phase is a fixed-price, $5,000 engagement with guaranteed deliverables within 30 days. This structure is designed to rebuild trust after a prior consultant (Malik) failed to deliver results on a $10,000+ project.
- The Vision: The long-term goal is to build a "Plotter Mechanics Hub"—a proprietary software platform that fully automates operations and could eventually be productized and sold to other businesses.

Topics

Plotter Mechanics' Business Model & Challenges

- Core Business: A service-first model focused on printer repair and support for other dealers, supplemented by sales of used equipment and a private-label ink line.
- Key Bottleneck: Chris Andrade is the sole expert technician, creating a burnout risk and preventing focus on strategic growth.
- Growth Opportunities:
  - Lucid Motors Contract: A potential high-volume film cutting service (200 cuts/day) that cannot be pursued due to current operational constraints.
  - Consumables Automation: Scaling the private-label ink business via an automated, drop-shipped e-commerce model.
  - Rental Program: Expanding a successful, high-revenue rental service ($35k from one customer last year).
- Operational Gaps:
  - Fragmented Systems: Disconnected tools (Jobber, QuickBooks, Shopify, Dropbox) cause data silos and inefficiencies.
  - Poor Communication: Critical information from field calls and texts is not consistently captured, leading to missed tasks and poor coordination with the office.
  - Inventory Management: Disorganized inventory and a lack of clear processes for RMAs and internal use cause stockouts and financial inaccuracies.

Arise Group AI's Proposed Solution

- Team: Arise Group AI is an engineering-as-a-service agency formed by Trent Christopher (industrial automation), Matthew Kerns (software engineering), and Mekaiel Abdullahi (IT/process).
- Initial "Quick Win" Phase: A 30-day, fixed-price engagement to deliver immediate, tangible relief and build trust.
  - Primary Tool: Implement Quo, a business phone system that will replace the current Vonage service.
  - Quo's Functionality:
    - Centralized Comms: Port the main business number to Quo, consolidating all calls and texts.
    - Call Routing: Automatically route calls to the correct person (e.g., admin to Alyssa, printing to Joe).
    - Transcription & Automation: Record and transcribe all business calls and texts.
      - Goal: Use AI to automatically create tasks, quotes, and Jobber entries from spoken words.
- Long-Term Vision:
  - Knowledge Capture: Systematically record Andrade's expertise (audio, video) to create a searchable knowledge base and SOPs for training new technicians.
  - Data Integration: Build a "command center" that unifies data from all systems (Jobber, QuickBooks, email) into a single, actionable dashboard.
  - Automated Pricing: Use AI to read vendor price lists (even unstructured PDFs) and automatically update pricing across all systems.
  - Productization: Develop the internal system into a proprietary "Plotter Mechanics Hub" software that could eventually be sold to other businesses.

Next Steps

- Arise Group AI:
  - Process the meeting transcript to refine the "Quick Win" proposal.
  - Deliver a revised proposal by the end of the week detailing the $5,000, 30-day deliverables.
- Plotter Mechanics:
  - Review the revised proposal and decide whether to proceed with the "Quick Win" phase.
- Both Parties: - If approved, schedule a kickoff call to grant Jobber access and plan the Quo implementation.
  Action Items
- Email Kelsey/Chris: $5k/30-day Quick Win proposal w/ deliverables + ROI; then schedule 1-hr kickoff - WATCH (5 secs): https://fathom.video/share/BqqdA1ZzP5zLf5GaEHNWNp7rzuqz9Syg?timestamp=8629.9999
- Grant Jobber access to Trent/Mekaiel/Matthew; then they set Quo test + Jobber integration - WATCH (5 secs): https://fathom.video/share/BqqdA1ZzP5zLf5GaEHNWNp7rzuqz9Syg?timestamp=8657.9999
