## Meeting Notes

### Service Operations and Capacity
The core focus is to streamline service calls and build team capacity to handle increased demand efficiently.

- Chris Andrade reported handling around 15 service calls weekly, averaging 3 to 4 calls per day, with each call including about 1 to 2 hours of labor and travel time (58:04).
- His technician, Joe, currently handles simpler tasks but is supported by Chris's 25 years of experience, allowing faster resolution and training on the job.
- Chris noted that about 50% of service calls could be solved remotely, saving time, but he prefers onsite visits for accuracy and training.
- Disruptions during service calls often cause delays, with Chris frequently multitasking by taking sales calls while working on service issues.
- Expanding the team with more technicians could increase capacity to up to 9 service calls daily, tripling current output, matching Chris's vision for growth (01:01:26).

Training new technicians like Joe takes roughly 3 months to reach 75% independence, with hands-on shadowing and real-time support being key (56:57).
- Joe's background and passion make him a fast learner, but Chris emphasized that new hires must have basic mechanical aptitude.
- Future plans include hiring Joe's brother to handle shop operations, freeing Joe for fieldwork and allowing a layered support structure (01:09:18).
- Chris stressed the importance of training on complex and sensitive service tasks to avoid costly mistakes, prioritizing high-value jobs for training materials.

Chris allocates about 1 hour daily collaborating with Joe and Alyssa, focusing on planning and coordination, with Joe rarely needing to call for help except on complex issues (54:40).
- Morning briefs and ongoing communication support smooth operations and workload management.
- Joe handles most calls independently and has proven reliable, reducing Chris's supervision time.

### Technology and Workflow Optimization
The main goal is to improve communication systems and workflow tools to reduce confusion and streamline job management.

Chris praised Quo for capturing and recording calls, creating automatic job records, and improving lead management, though he noted bugs with call routing and default app settings impair efficiency (31:45).
- Incoming calls are well tracked, but follow-up calls often lose context, requiring manual intervention to create distinct jobs.
- The system currently merges multiple opportunities into single jobs, complicating tracking and follow-up.

Chris highlighted the need for improvements in contact data integration, citing outdated and duplicated contacts causing confusion (36:07).
- Mekaiel committed to sharing these insights with Trent and Matthew for system refinements.

Chris uses multiple communication channels including personal phone, Quo app, and direct texts to ensure messages are received, showing current workflows lack full integration and cause inefficiencies (34:20).
- He often texts individual team members directly rather than relying solely on Quo-based communication.
- Chris expressed desire for better contact and call data synchronization across Capsule CRM, QuickBooks, Jobber, and Outlook.

Priority is given to simplifying interfaces and removing unused custom fields in Jobber to reduce clutter and improve ease of use (05:50).
- The team plans to analyze workflows and adjust system permissions, especially for new users like Andrew.

### Financial Baseline and Revenue Insights
Chris shared key financial metrics and revenue expectations, emphasizing growth and opportunity with current systems.

Annual revenue was approximately $850,000 last year with an expected increase to $1 million in the current year driven by service and equipment sales (03:35).
- Supplies revenue is declining but equipment sales and service calls remain strong revenue sources.
- Service calls generate roughly $175 per hour plus travel fees, with service labor constituting the backbone of his income (58:16).

Hourly wages for key team members Joe and Alyssa are around $20 to $22 per hour (03:20).
- This staffing cost supports a lean but effective team capable of handling growing workload.

Chris stressed the importance of tagging and tracking customer ownership across partner companies to avoid conflicts and ensure proper billing, illustrating complexity in managing client relationships (05:20).
- The current lack of clarity on maintenance contract statuses and renewals causes missed opportunities and billing issues (24:00).
- Mekaiel proposed a joint session with Andrew and the internal team to build systems for better contract management.

### Team Development and Delegation
Building a reliable, self-sufficient team is central to Chris's vision of scaling operations.

Joe transitioned from part-time helper to full-time technician over six months, becoming largely independent recently (06:18).
- Chris values self-starters who bring initiative and reduce his oversight burden.
- Training is heavily hands-on, using real jobs as learning opportunities to build skills quickly.

Plans to hire Joe's brother aim to create a support role in shop operations, allowing Joe to focus on fieldwork and advanced service jobs (09:18).
- This will create a tiered technician structure with lead and backup roles to increase capacity.

Chris wants to build training materials, especially video tutorials, to scale knowledge transfer efficiently (12:01).
- He intends to record service visits and share educational content for technician training and marketing.
- This approach aims to reduce repetitive explanations and accelerate new hire onboarding.

### Supplies and Printing Business Development
The supplies and printing divisions are emerging growth areas supported by Andrew's involvement and new system integrations.

Andrew is transitioning into a supplies-focused role, handling follow-ups on service calls and upselling ink and related products (17:59).
- Andrew's background in supplies and customer relations complements Chris's service focus.
- Chris envisions supplies revenue eventually surpassing service revenue due to consistent follow-up and upsell opportunities.

Current printing operations are informal but growing, generating about $2,000 in sticker sales over the past three weeks (28:24).
- Printing serves as an extension of service offerings and community engagement, including ministry support.
- Chris plans to spin off printing under a separate LLC, Mighty Picks, to avoid conflicts with service customers.

System needs include inventory management and workflow integration for printing supplies, currently managed manually without expense tracking (32:24).
- Chris wants to build processes for cost calculation, inventory deduction, and order management to scale printing profitably.

Andrew's upcoming visit is planned for field training and warehouse organization, with a follow-up meeting to align systems and workflows (24:44).
- The team will prioritize integrating Andrew into Quo and Jobber and provide Mac-specific training for invoicing and inventory.

### Long-Term Vision and Strategic Priorities
Chris's overarching goal is to free himself from operational chaos to focus on ministry and business growth.

Chris works about 70 hours a week, with roughly 40 hours on clear billable tasks and 30 hours spent managing confusion and priorities (47:55).
- He seeks to build systems and delegate effectively to reduce his daily operational load.

His vision includes scaling Plotter Mechanics and Mighty Picks into efficient, systemized businesses, enabling him to focus on mentoring and ministry work (35:00).
- Plans include launching a nonprofit to mentor at-risk youth using outdoor and faith-based activities.
- Chris emphasized the importance of building a team that brings value and self-starts, allowing him to step back from day-to-day tasks.

Marketing and educational content creation are strategic priorities to drive leads and build brand authority (12:53).
