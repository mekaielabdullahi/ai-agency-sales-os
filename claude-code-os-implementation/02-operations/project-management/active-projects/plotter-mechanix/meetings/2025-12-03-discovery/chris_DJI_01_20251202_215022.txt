Just think about all the problems that you're having.
How much do you think you're losing every month off of those problems in your head?
Oh, I don't really know.
I probably lost like 10,000 dollars last year.
It total. 10,000 last year total.
That's pretty good.
Okay, okay, perfect.
Okay, let's just keep it.
Let's break it down to the month of what we've talked about your base problem.
The problem is the biggest problem is that I'm the only one that knows anything about a printer here.
So if anybody calls my company out of all the fingers I have out there right now,
a list of the handle supplies orders, you know, and basic things.
But at the end of the day, like I have to talk to the person.
I have to sell the person I have to do everything.
So you're saying like so much.
If I don't come to work, we're not making any money.
So I see.
So the business just creeps to a halt and within a couple of months, we'd be out of business.
So you're saying the tea like.
I mean, the majority of our calls are service calls.
And you're the only one here who can do service.
I continue to print head on.
Yeah.
I could do some like maintenance.
She's knowledgeable, but she's not the person that.
You know, a lot of a lot of like what you do here is selling people.
So out of the technical work that service calls that you get.
How much of that is like if you rank the technicality of that service call out of that range.
And what is there a way to determine the if the problem is at your caliber or Joe's caliber.
Yeah.
Or Alyssa's caliber.
Like is there a way to gauge that?
Yeah.
To some degree.
I mean,
I get involved in.
I don't even know what I'm doing.
Oh, shit.
I've never even seen the printer.
Dude.
Nobody even know what it is.
Never seen it.
Never heard of it.
Interesting.
Scared the shit out of me, dude.
I saw this big guy and dusty ass thing.
I was like, it looks like a piece of garbage.
Like the heads are $3,000 a piece and there's 12 of them.
Jesus.
Okay.
Gotcha.
And this lady wants me to save the day.
It's like there's no miracle.
Okay.
Cool.
Cool.
But I can't send Joe over there.
Right.
Like I couldn't even make something out of it.
You know what I mean?
So.
Right.
I don't know what I'm getting into.
And then things happen, dude.
Cool.
I appreciate that.
And that's another thing, too.
Like a lot of my opportunities that I gain come from being out there.
Oh, I see what you're saying.
Like if I'm driving to this place and then right next door is another dude.
I'm over there giving business cards, you know.
So like I was just this week.
I was.
Do you enjoy that?
Totally.
Yeah.
Is that where you find your enjoyment when you're working your business?
I like going to places, talking to the owners of the company.
And what the pain points are.
Loot in my business card.
And then later on I get a call.
You're having this week.
So I dropped a card off this lady.
And then I got a call.
Agnew training.
And I was like, Agnew training.
I go back to my notes.
I look.
I think I look at the address.
Like, no shit.
Man, I dropped a business card over there like three weeks ago.
Three months ago.
And now they're calling.
You mentioned your notes.
What do you mean?
Where are you?
Where is your notes?
Like what notes are you storing?
Where do you keep messages?
History.
Like I went back.
Like when I get a contact, I send it to Alyssa.
I say, hey, take a picture.
I send it to her.
I say, can you add that to the database?
Send them an e-mail.
Give them my contact.
And how does that process look, Alyssa?
Does that work out pretty well when he does that?
When he sends you a business card to fill out, I guess, a news.
Like when I did it.
It works pretty well.
I put them into the system.
I send them an e-mail.
Hey, there's four mechanics.
And then this is all through job.
What am I assuming as your CEO?
I wouldn't say we're there yet.
But I try and I'm extremely adamant about her when she's on the phone.
She can't get through several numbers, but I can't.
I'm like, hey, I need your cell phone number.
And I'm going to send you a text message right now,
because I don't want to be sitting in this dude's driveway where I can't get through
and no one's answering the phone.
I'm not going to solicit your shit.
I'm not going to send you marketing and all that.
But when I send that message, I'll be there in 45 minutes.
You better be there.
Right.
Yeah.
So I want all of the communication to be through job.
But then what happens is like people open the messages and don't do anything about it.
And then don't.
Then it's fucked.
You know what I mean?
People will read the message, but don't handle it and don't market as unread.
And then nobody sees the message.
Where did you find it helpful?
I skimmed the job or text messages every morning.
I sit in the hot terminal.
I go through job or message communication.
I go through my text messages back to like a couple days,
because there's things in there.
You know what?
That aren't finished yet.
I have like a bunch of...
I don't even look at my inbox anymore, bro.
Do you email?
No.
I can't look at it too much.
She's dealing with most of it.
I skim it just to make sure I'm not missing an opportunity,
but the rest of it like claiming it, getting rid of the junk mail is like...
So listen, when you're going through his emails,
how does he get a report of his emails?
Like, she calls you, says she lets you know.
Basically, if there's something that needs to be handled,
I just tell her to call me.
Because otherwise, I'm not looking at my email for hours on end.
Right, right.
Got it.
Text messages, even.
And who do you use for email?
So is all your environments through Microsoft 365?
Mm-hmm.
So you have a Microsoft 365 account?
Yes.
Cool.
Next question.
Timeline and future.
How long have you been dealing with this particular problem?
And if you don't take action in the next six to 12 months,
what does the future of your business look like?
I've been dealing with this problem since the beginning of time,
since I first ever had a business.
Which was when?
Oh, it's part of the previous one.
Wow.
But just, you know, I thought with this drive to technology
and everything, things would get more easier to do.
But the every piece of technology I add in my business makes it more complicated
and more messed up, dude.
And elaborate on that.
How?
It's just there's too many pieces.
Like, there's a website.
There's the database.
There's the CRM.
There's the interface with the, you know, Java now.
We've got like all these different things.
They don't have the same information.
So like, I've got capsule, QuickBooks, Java, Shopify.
All have different information.
Some's got some shade over there.
Some's got it over there.
Yeah.
I got Outlook.
I got text messages.
I got a text message on my cell.
My business number has a text number.
Java has a text number.
I have a text number.
Right.
Nobody calls the office hardly ever.
They call my cell phone.
Even though they're out of the numbers, they call myself
because they know that they're going to get the results.
So do you have a private number to separate your personal life
from your business life?
Does that drive you crazy?
No, because people don't really bother me when it begins.
Okay.
You know, like, it's just during business hours when there's money to be made.
I'm going to be available and take the call to the office.
100 percent.
Nothing I hate worse than calling a place and get the fucking voice mail.
Yeah.
I don't, I go to the next place, bro.
And that's where I get a lot of my business.
Yeah.
Actually, honestly, the reason I get a lot of my business is because people will call in.
I got her train now to where she knows I'm out there.
She knows where I'm at.
She's got the map in front of her.
And she's like, hey, Kelsey, there's a call that came up in 10b.
I'm going to throw it on your schedule real quick.
If you can make it by the day.
It's a quick, quick $500 grab.
Bingo.
Right.
I've already got like my schedule.
I already know what it needs.
What?
Who I push back.
Right.
Oh no, shit.
So if you're over there and you can spend an extra 30 minutes to make a grand.
And you can push it back.
So is that and that's where job.
See, that stuff doesn't happen unless you got a brain behind it.
Right.
You got to have somebody with common sense.
That's like, okay.
Oh.
10b today.
This call just came in there and 10b.
Maybe I should call Kelsey and tell him.
Like before, Alyssa came along and we had job her and all this shit going on.
This guy over here and writing on a note.
I'd be out in Mesa.
I'd come back tomorrow.
You see a note from the day he did.
Oh, yeah.
Jim Bob called for Mesa.
Five minutes from there.
Yes, that you dickhead.
Like now I'm going to be driving for another two hours.
You don't have a shit about me.
You show up late to work every day.
And then I got a drive for four hours because of it.
So do you see Kelsey's location on the jobber's map?
Does it provide you a ping of his?
He has my cell phone right there.
She could look at my location.
Oh, so you share your location with her cell phone with her?
I don't, but she could.
I don't.
She doesn't need to know where I'm at.
She knows about where I'm at by.
Oh, what are you going?
I see.
Like, jobber looks different on us.
Her screen.
Like, I can't even use the computer version of it.
Hardly.
Why is the user interface just completely different?
It does more things.
It's more.
It's.
Yeah, it's just the cell phone.
Okay.
It's good to know.
Good to know.
Good to know.
Do you like jobber?
I mean, look what she's looking at.
It's pretty good.
There's something that you.
I mean, I can't look at all those.
Yeah.
Oh, yeah.
So I've got everything on my calendar.
So I can keep track of everything and everyone.
So do you.
Is it.
If there were.
You filter it and turn off certain things if it's overwhelming.
I'm going to ask you this question.
I want to ask you too, but I'm going to ask Liska.
If there was a magic wand solution, if I gave you a magic wand.
And you can build a perfect no compromise solution to fix any problem.
What specific tool or system would that look like for plot or mechanics?
Well, if we could get the inventory and wrap that would be fantastic.
That's your magic wand.
Say so because then he's going to call me and say,
I need you to prepare this and this and this and this.
Do we have this?
And then I can just look over.
Oh, okay.
Now she's like, oh, you have this.
She's running like back and forth.
Okay.
And what's your magic wand?
If you had a magic wand, what problem would you wave or solve with one wave?
A reliable field tech.
Hmm.
I can go on and leave you a 50% of my deal.
I will be number two for sure.
Responsibilities.
Because I'm not.
Why?
I can't do it.
I can't do anything new.
I don't want to do anything like I'm trying not to do this.
You know what I mean?
Because I'm trying to like, well, yeah, you have freedom, bro.
I think you start a business to get freedom.
But you don't have freedom because this is called.
I never really have had freedom, but I'm actually at a place now in my business.
Because I started with basically nothing.
Right.
And so now I'm at a point where I have steady cash below.
And like, I'm not at least my, my worries and like, how am I going to pay for the bills or whatever.
Right.
I'm not looking, I have all the things and tools I need to keep sustained operation.
I have inventory.
I have parts, you know, like I, I don't want to inventory all these parts, but I have parts for jobs that I need.
I can't wait to show you my solution for that, by the way, but yeah.
Magic wand.
Yeah.
Think about that.
What do you think about that?
Can I go use a restroom?
I would say like.
Okay.
Yeah.
Think about that real quick.
Okay.
You have to, you've got to do the job.
It's got to be reasonable for the customer to want to pay it, too.
You know what I mean?
Like, if I go out and do a job and it takes me three hours, or I send something that's unknowledgeable, doesn't know what they're doing.
It takes them two days.
He's like a mechanic and that's why I'm.
So I'm going to pay for all the mistakes that that guy needs because he doesn't have 25 years of experience.
Yeah.
So, and you're so funny because we were talking about that with our years of experience at my house.
Tricks at my sleep, bro.
So that came up with our development team yesterday.
How do we charge people?
And so what we're doing, what I haven't talked to them in now since, hey guys, we're going to talk to you on this subject is that my thought is.
Same thing for a mechanic, right?
A mechanic has to change an alternator.
If we, let's say our alternator is a simple implementation of an API or build something for a customer, right?
I know our guys could associate that one task to an hourly rate, just like a mechanic.
There's a standard hourly rate to change an alternator.
There's a standard hourly rate to change.
That will bearing a break.
You know what I'm saying?
There's, I think it's the automotive industry standard of billable hours.
Now, if that mechanic is so good because he spent 15 years changing breaks and he can change a break in 30 minutes,
but they're able to bill 2.5 hours, that's the profit, right?
Same shit with you.
I feel like we should, and this is what I want to talk to my team about, is we develop our for a lack of better term hourly rate for specific jobs, aka building something out for you.
Oh, because it sounds like we have a change of a print head paper.
Okay, paper is to say 25.25 of an hour.
A print head is usually at 1.75, right?
So you give a denominating value for every task that will ultimately say, okay, this is actually five billable hours.
If I get it done in three, I'm making money.
The customer doesn't need to know that, but at least we are creating that margin.
So we know, fuck, I spent five and a half hours, I actually, I didn't lose money, but I could have made more money for the next time.
And maybe have a system where you can say, hey, next time, let's do this instead of that, we would have saved an hour.
You know what I'm saying?
Like be able to make your, your systems, your, because if we, from what I'm hearing, if they're, we can figure out a way to replicate you.
And if all that takes is by wearing a camera while you service these printers.
And then now you have a digital recording of how the shit works and you're talking to yourself as that.
When I am working, yeah, dude, and they're so small and you wouldn't even like, you would like that is bigger, bigger than that.
And now you have a digital reference that your next service guy, your next service call can follow.
Hey, and let's, well, I would like to take all those videos and put them online.
You see what's happening right now?
And, and, you know, I got Joe, I hired Joe, and I said, Joe, you gotta go through and post all these ads online for me.
Post all these printers that we have for sale, we post them high, you get to our name out there.
But now I'm getting calls from like all these states, you know, remote support.
Like I'm doing like telephone calls and charging people like, I understand five bucks to talk to them on the phone.
And they're happy to pay because.
Dude, so wait, wait, wait, wait, hold on, let's elaborate on that for one second.
Dude, did I just hear you say you get paid for consulting somebody over the phone and you don't have to leave your office?
Yeah, I could be doing that all day long.
But I focused on that from, to be honest with you, dude, like I'm tired of this driving around the city.
Yeah.
And all this, whatever.
Yeah.
If I could figure out how to optimize the web.
Right.
Keep my service business running down here.
Right.
Move to Piantop.
Sit upon a porch and mic.
Oh, I'm going to fucking get you there, bro.
And sit there with my earbuds on and just be like, hey, what's up?
You know, FaceTiming.
Let's go, you know, like, can I have a spot up there with you?
And then we can have one of those mornings together?
Yeah.
Awesome.
I can't wait.
I can't wait.
But that's what I, I mean, like as I'm doing more of it, you know, it's like remote service.
Like I could be somewhere else where I am not fighting traffic back and forth.
And there's so many people out there that are doing with themselves.
I want to do it themselves, but they need some help, you know, and like.
So what, like, how, what the, I like it.
I enjoy training.
So what if, what if we created like another version of the polymath guild, right?
Where you have become the mecca of knowledge or you have built your name about just fixing printers.
And there's a particular job that you necessarily don't want, but you know another service tech.
Like, hey, dude, I have this item.
I have this repair.
I really don't have time for it.
Would you be interested in taking that work on?
I do it all the time.
And then I have other guys that work for me.
So, so it is not morally unacceptable to ask for a fee if you keep repeatedly sending that guy work.
Right?
It is not morally wrong for you to do that.
You have put time and money.
What I do is I, you know, like, I know what it's like.
Like, when your cop, your machine broke and you need that thing to work.
And you can't get there until Tuesday, but you got a guy that could be there on Monday.
Yeah.
Right.
People call me with that.
I'm not looking for the work, but they'll call me and be like, hey, if I'm out and I'm like, hey, if you have problem, that cop, you're calling me in there.
That's, that's the customer service aspect.
You know, like, we basically charge the same rate.
So we charge 250 for a service call.
And that guy charged me 150.
I make 100 bucks.
He makes his rate.
Bro.
You don't fucking do nothing.
That's the best part.
But the problem is, Kelsey, we have to start with, we have to get this place just humming.
Yeah.
There's so much disconnect in here.
It's the whole process of even taking care of it.
You can't you can't do nothing, bro.
If the foundation is broke and the API thing, now what's the name of the list?
I had my hopes up really high about it because it's all the shit he told me, sound great.
But just the constant not seeing anything ever happened.
So what?
So, and I wanted to touch on this guys, like, let's hear this really loud and clear.
But then we talked to Malik.
We got a workshop.
Let's make this very importantly aware that the reason why Kelsey did not like his
deliverable is because the
frequency of conversation to you of the status of the project because there was no status
update that you can physically see. I mean I got a bunch of status updates every week but there's
nothing I've never physically came to like some bullshit like template that didn't work
and the idea behind it was good and I you know I was throwing my ideas like I like it like this
yeah that's cool oh oh you know the website all wrong oh we got to read oh you know so now he's
like fumbling around with the website read and he changed a whole bunch of stuff in the website
because of what I told you about the groups or how would I choose in there so he didn't realize
how big a thing problem it was so I was like look just make it work with like four products
that I sell right I was looking at your website last night actually I actually threw it through
our little skimmer that we have like so this so this is the same problem you're looking for
you sick yeah but we're going to have the same problem with SNS wool sheds like we're going to
develop their same dude literally legitimately the same situation although they don't sell
prints but the foundation of the overall company the the wool sheds the ones that we printed
those banners for and all that yeah my mom and my dad's yeah same situation so I am literally
starting at the ground the foundation right and working my way up and and that's that's that's
my method of approach and it's literally the same thing here man we're going to do small little
incremental gains I like jobber but everything out like I have a whole another CRM that has shit
loads of emails contact information you guys don't use it well we transitioned to jobber and it's
still I still use it because I have all my password so we just need to extract everything from it
I do you pay for it monthly yeah but not much okay that's a 30 bucks hey man that shit adds up
though bro powerful program no I agree I don't want I don't want to pay for it if I don't have to
it's a pretty powerful program but I just don't it's too powerful you know what I mean like it's
got oh and what's this called a capsule oh that you mentioned that okay and they have a whole like
CRM integration I'm not marketing integration where you can do like so what did you like about it
that jobber did it offer vice versa well when I started the company over the first time I did it
I used I don't even know what I did man I used quickbooks professional eventually but an
outlet and just word them out okay okay I built I built that thing up what was the question
do you ask me just like what was the difference that you like capsule versus oh when I started
over I was like I had kind of like not worked for a year so like I was and I had relaxed and since
it was my company I never I didn't really present myself as the owner all the time because that's
sucks you know I just be like a worker right right right right well next what I thought it
and I was just the worker so I just acted like a worker right right you know I just kind of
so when I started over and I started like cold calling and stuff I was like
calling the same people over in the same day like oh shit like I'm like going to keep track of this
you know so I did a little bit of research and I was like well quickbooks sucks and I did some
CRM research and the first one that somebody would actually contact me and help me with was
capsule gotcha so they got me on the phone they gave me a little rundown they helped me get my
information show me how to import my that's this that's the second time I heard in two days one guy
pays 40 G's a year for his software for his CRM but he does like heavy steel fabrication I talked
to him last night a little bit he paid 40 grand a year because the agent gave him his login
walked him through the process pretty much hold it his hand for the first two months and then he
got a $40,000 a year contract out of it because of it I was like god damn and what you're telling me
is you signed up over because of that fact too then I tried to use it but I couldn't get the people
I worked with to implement and use it with me so I'm just using it a lot you're talking about
your co-workers or your employees he's not here anymore okay so use that my sister log on
evolve she got it all set up for me but it's just overcomplicated it did it was lacking a whole
bunch of features that job are having she was already using jobber for husband's carburet clean
oh the jobber doesn't do a good job with jobber does no integration with the website
right build like a service-based website that's just like I want my carburet clean but you want
to have products and shit as they don't deal with that so but it handled the texting for one
location right the woman we went all over it right right taking the notes you know like I'd put
I'd have to log into QuickBooks put my notes in and then I have to go into capsule and do some
other shit and there's just too much stuff on the phone for me I'm like I don't want to do this
man like I'm tired of my phone yeah so jobber brings it all into one location but I still but I
still because of the data being skewed all over we haven't brought all of our garbage into jobber
so all of our database still has all the shit in it and jobber just has looks in QuickBooks damn dude
so much opportunity I'm so excited my whole database of my old clients you know it's old now
but I still have all the emails and phone numbers and all that I could be marketing and doing
them hey I'm over here hey I've got compatible links hey check this out make videos dude like you
should you should put these in here because I'm gonna come over there and help you here's my
self here's my number here's my so your tell out what I'm also hearing here is that you're
gonna need some sort of media agency as well to kind of manage your videos but then also that
can turn your daily output which would be rewearing the camera showing your daily routine
that is opportunity for marketing well that can all turn into something that's going to be
web-based sales right we got to get the end no this I'm just I'm just thinking out loud but you're
right it's like my aims for instance I could drop shit my aims directly from the manufacturer
they already have my labels I should oh no shit so they could drop shit before me I could
automate it to where an order comes in it gets paid PO gets sent over drop ship information
so so we don't even have to touch it that's what I want to do so it's fun you bring that up and
let me ask this question before I do okay so we uh I don't think we elaborated on your idea of
the magic wand can we go over that real quick oh the magic wand would just be basically a way
to get communication to happen properly sweet like everything all your systems all your pieces
all of my pieces to communicate with each other so that we can communicate with each other better
be efficient be it more of a better team operation right right right perfect like I just want one
hub where I go and that's what that thing that guy was building for me was supposed to be got it
and but I was like well this thing doesn't do all the things job or does so yeah let me let me
use the job for my service stuff yeah like well she has to add a product she's got to add it
into QuickBooks job right all right listen I've already thought of this I think when we first
talked when we printed out those trifles like seven weeks ago I just didn't know how to do it yeah
I still don't know how to do it but I got guys who do and I can't wait for them to see this dude
they're gonna look you've just talked to Malik about what he did yeah because he has all the
database I'm gonna get I'm gonna I'll I'll initiate the conversation with Malik yeah and then
what I'm gonna do is have Malik talk to the guys yeah the developers the guys who actually know
what the fuck he's talking about because I ultimately I spent a lot of money and if there's
no way to recover any of that work that you do oh no no a hundred percent we're not gonna let
that go to waste for nothing man we're here to work for you well he he did a bunch of work in
Shopify and he was he was trucking along but I just couldn't keep anime right for nothing right so
quick question now the last one the core of the why you choose to build this business in a tough
high stakes logistical market what's the story behind plotter mechanics and what drove you to make
the direct access rental or like selling the e-commerce like the prints and all that stuff
like what drove you to do that just start a business well why did you start the business like
ultimately we knew that you started working and servicing printers and then that just got expanded
on right well no what happened is I worked at a company for the first 10 to 12 years of my corporate
life and I hated it I hated working in the opposite environment I hated all the office drama
of bickering that went on there I mean the way that people acted when the box was there and wasn't
there and I just didn't fit into that environment I I like to go out and work I always gotten paid
but I think that I was really getting out of it was a sense of accomplishment you know what I mean
so like yeah like my wife might not like me but my customer was happy that I fixed their printer
as a kid growing up you know like I barely graduated high school so you know my family's like
they call it I became an accidental entrepreneur
tell the person how to do it and honestly if I had to start over again right now after doing it
two or three times I still don't know what to do I feel like bro I'm like yeah I got fired
all I knew how to do was fix printers and help people and I've been doing that for the last 20
years but every time I start doing that the generate revenue and then I need people then it falls
apart and I'm managing I don't manage the people properly because I'm too busy
yeah you're working in the business not on the business yeah and I want to start doing that
because I actually do like training people like I like going places where people don't know how to do
something and teaching them a better way to do it or see a way that they're doing it like I have
a clock lady right now I mean she's got a legit clock business bro they sell custom clocks from
seven inches 12 inches 15 like a pizza do all the 36 custom printed on wood and these printers are
expensive a hundred thousand dollars well they're they're they're dilapidated one isn't complete
this with disarray and it needs like probably twenty thousand dollars or the work to get it to run
again or she could buy that printer over there for ten grand get some nice material and change
your process oh it's talking to me I'm actually going to call her because she can't stop
printing what she's been doing because it looks a certain way do you want to call her right now
and just see how that goes or do you want to wait to do that separately well no I'll talk to her
later but see she sent me these pictures this is her new process so she went and had some shit
printed at Montroy and then she buys these rings for the wood and she pops these rings onto the
wood around the edges of it to make the finish the edge off because right now she prints right
on the wood they take a round piece
