just to set it up okay this is my Kelsey's mic so you have what's that no DJ so
you can you have a clip that you can clip this on or you can put the magnet
through your shirt yeah so I find the magnet a little easier
so that's already recording so the reason why I ask you about the time yeah it's
like do you tell me you know I have some questions that I can ultimately
they start so these are pretty much this kind of the script of what I'm gonna
stick to the whole point of why we're doing this is a for me to learn how to
interview a business owner in a way like I'm all I'm trying to do is understand
the story of your business the story of the problems you occur every day
ultimately if we pursue that type of I don't want to say interview but that
process of just telling the story right that's kind of my approach to
ultimately provide you the resources in far as the integrations the
communications all that kind of stuff oh it's already there okay so where's that
job at oh Scott still I think I'll show you right now I'll show you what I do
I'll show you how I basically what I'm doing so mirroring to the screen okay is
the proof for my little white side I love that and then there's the back he sent
me a proof earlier where the fist was right in the center and it was right
across the whole car and I kind of liked that better but I also I told him to
put all that latex DTF shit on the on the roof rack thing because people are
gonna stare at that thing on my roof while I'm in traffic and shit you know what I mean
so let go around it would like bullet points at an angle or something I don't
really know I don't know there was a way to put that right there oh it's easy you
can put it however you think I can be mad up on the top of the roof I think that
might be pretty good you could have it in there twice but originally had it
across the back of the whole trunk oh yeah it was like right here like towards
a license plate right yeah right like the wrist was like at the bottom of the
trunk and it was like a whole boom across there but I was like and I I want
them to give me I want him to move that shit up to the car carrier because that's
where people are gonna be staring at when I'm in traffic when they're looking at
my car and they'll be able to read it just like the key words like I put like I
don't I don't really know how to do it but I put latex DTF DTG solvent UV
curable aquis resin like all the key words that people would know in the
industry you know I mean if you don't know what that means that that means you
don't know what I do and it doesn't really matter right and then I got my
little barcode there so they could take a picture of people that you know are
savvy to that stuff hyperlinks are the way to go yeah yeah I created a new logo
I want you to see it here's the hood
oh yeah that's fire so yeah I want to put some more I'm no it's a sign on
I'm gonna I'm gonna probably a second surface wrap the car carrier you know
what I mean to put the decals up there like the information or something and I
might do the logos of the companies in color on there like where it says
cannon momma you know that probably but I can put those on after I do the
wraps I can put them over I want for HP HP would be blue right so use like
the logos yeah Muto's blue graph text blue cannons red momma is like purple yeah
so I might put that on the on the roof rack up top or I like I kind of like
the way it looks across the bottom of lower across like the the kick panel across
the bottom yeah yeah yeah that's what I like and then I can put like a white
stroke around the outside of it so it kind of pops out of there yep so how is
your Adobe so cycle going what does that mean like because before you had Lee
in taking all of the artwork that I submitted to Adobe is are you guys able to
start or like still do like so let's say if you have a random person who created
their artwork in Adobe can you help them modify the document to get to print
yeah do Joe's pretty good at this that's what I was trying to say is Joe like
we saw this guy a printer he had a cutter and I was like oh that thing's a
piece of shit Joe's like that's the same one I got in my house I was like oh yeah
I forgot dude because they have a bunch of cheap as Chinese tools that there's
house he's got a he's got a Chinese bender for making like channel letters and
shit and he knows how to run all that stuff he saw he saw this machine that
was like 10 12 feet long yesterday and he was like oh I could run that I was
like damn dude I don't even know what that is yeah and then like we went to this
guy's office yesterday and I was like the guy called me out there because he
wanted to trade me for my printer for his bus to ask one and I'm like and then
give me some broken laminar so I get I you know I get in the courtesy of stopping
by well on the way there he's like oh dude maybe you know with my printer you
know like I'm having all these problems I got this wrap I got to try to wrap
these cars I got to fix a panel and I can't get it to match and so I'm like okay
well this is kind of turned into a service called this point you know I mean
if I go over there and I look at the situation I'm like look bro I go this
original shit you printed is wrong like you were missing a color a print he's
like yeah but it looks cool dude I go I don't give a shit but to recreate
something that looks cool when your printer was running off of you know a
missing channel of a print head your you let your lack in 50% of your black I'm
like look at your black text it's like blue so yeah but you liked it and I was
like well recreate that shit good luck dude not even a perfect not even an
expert could do that dude but I zoomed in on it and showed it to him like like
you showed him the pixel counts well just take it like look at this man I
I believe I thought I saved it yeah right here
these are the two colors and I'm like this this is not from a distance but up
close so like if you look how much bleed there is right it's everything looks
like shit but just look at look at this is that this is what it looks like so
you got like some cyan magenta yellow some greens you know but you don't see
a lot of black I mean there's a there's a there's blacks in their black so
that's how you're determining that's what he that's what he liked oh but this is
what he was getting and what is that again this is just zoomed in this is
what everything looks like when you zoom in oh so this is the actual dot dude
you use your use your camera to kind of well I'm just looking at it just just
saying look at the way this looks like see how dark that is then how it like
more more there's no white in the background you see how it's just all color if
you look at this one over here there's lots of vacant space in the back you
know what I mean like white areas right where the other one just flooded with
ink so like I'm at how he created that color who knows man like you just
got to start guessing and making samples and he's trying to like match a panel
like they did the panel wrong where that where the text is lines up like this on
the doors so he's got to redo the panel well now he's gonna have to match that
color in the center and it's gonna look like shit dude like you can have to do
the whole back of the van you know to get it to look where this guy that just
spent three or four thousand dollars is gonna shit his pants when he looks at
it so he's got three partially done wraps and the guy stressing out you know
and it's like not my fault but I spent an hour my time there looking at his
broken fucking laminators while he's asking me for advice and I tell him telling
him you know I go look dude he's like I go just work with Michael dude like I
go Michael's better than I am with this anyways he's like yeah but he's busy
dude and I go well you got to wait for his ass dude like you know like I don't
know I don't know what you know what he how often do you come in those scenarios
daily every day's a trial you know like I mean I'm doing an install for a guy
that right now today that you know he's paying me a thousand bucks to do an
install in an episode which is crazy to me but there's like some guy in
Scottsdale wants somebody to hand delivery into his house into this funky
situation and yeah I don't have a problem doing it and now that I got a
person to help me like Joe's Joe so Joe he jumped in on that guy's computer
start tweaking the color bar and within like two tries had it as close as
anything that guy'd gotten an hours you know so we leave and I charge him you
know I go tell this I go to service call I go we got pictures we got proof we
did all this stuff and the guy just hits his pants and I stopped get back to
him because I just now I know what I'm dealing with like somebody who
appreciated what I did and came out there and you know gave him my own I go
look you know here's the deal dude like the first thing is next time before you
print a document do a nozzle check and make sure your machine's up to par so
that you can recreate this shit later on like I mean even if your machine is
running at top notch and you print a wrap today on a HP and you come back two
months later and do it again it's it's not likely going to look identical dude so
is there like depending on the color is it because people just don't know you
think or like why what makes this easy he's just ignorant beyond the fact
that well he he just got lucky he's like he's like who looks it looks good so I
went with it I was like well it doesn't look right I was like look at your
monitor and look at what you look what you gave the guy like these don't look
right but this what your monitor and what you're printing out over here they
look a lot alike you know you're trying to make what's on the monitor look like
not what it's coming out of the printer and that's not I mean I've got all the
tools to figure it out but I don't know how to use them dude like spectrophotometers
and I have a $3,000 spectro that I could go over there it's a it's a media
profiler it's a it's a it's a it's a it's a it's a camera dude it's a color
camera that takes a picture of the color and gives it gives you a value of that
color and where's the output go to that like is it just like a like is it
give you like a grade or yeah you create a profile so like HP's actually have
a built-in spectrophotometer in them oh really yeah so like HP their print head
drifts all over the place so they have they have always had a way to self-calibrate
since the beginning so with your the alignments their self-calibrate morning
who's that oh laminy yeah oh yeah I gotta go show how many uses laminy yeah
let me get print um me I'll stop the recording yeah yeah let me go over there
and help him because you want to take the mic off for a second you can go over
there and make a video about it yeah yeah make a video I'm I sold this guy
this laminar I'm gonna show him my user right now you got you already got
laminar everything who did that for you uh lush dub media yeah check it out dude
I'm gonna he he I'm gonna print it myself since I have all the machines but
he designed it right I'm gonna change up the back I'm gonna lay it down probably
Gus at the end of the sweet down here because lushtub this guy lushtub and Gus
work together like Gus doesn't have a printer yeah so I just fixed his
printer form recently and so I'm like dude let me use you to design my rap
because he's he's talented so I know but I mean I'm just working with the guy
because I'm trying to promote him too you know like I I'm taking his money so
I'm like maybe I should give him my money take take some of mine too oh that's
right you do I need to it but take some more of it actually I do I need to get caught
up but hopefully this let's go do this all right well let's go do this
yeah what kind of event uh the bikers and beards thing beard that'll you know I
think you have my I wonder if Joe ever put that valve on I think he did
huh on yours yeah oh he put I thought I thought he put it on mine he put
the new one yours oh and he put that mine back I know but yours is fixed I'm
saying is mine fixed yet I don't know I ordered the part but I don't know if he put
it on yet
do you know there's somebody else who what did you say there's somebody else oh what's up
dude I'm sorry what's up bro oh shit what's up man you need some ink or what's
going on okay this fight and this one is that good one and I saw you can
see the little right there yeah yeah the bottom yeah you know what we we actually
we actually just had a problem with this shit and and a list has been going back
and forth with the manufacturer yeah but let me call it really quick and ask
her which because we got new ones I think they figured it out let me let me see
what is that a 712 hang on a second let me call it real quick
yeah man it's good sometimes yeah I know I get some help I'm getting some help I got a
guy that I'm training that's pretty good hey listen hey remember all those
problems we've been having with the 712 being cartridges I got pro block over here
and he's got five of them that don't work and one that does work and he just pointed
out to me that the chip on the one that works and the one that doesn't work looks
different and do we have any that work you got that figured out with those guys
yeah all right let me yeah yeah that's okay let me check the chips that we have
then hold on a second I mean this one only the one that works has one or two
that's a 712 right cuz it's weird man like I've actually had this happened I've
taken it out of one and put it in another one and it worked hey Alyssa we only have six of
these on the shelf and I can just give them all five of the ones I have and you can
try them if they don't work you can bring them back but I'll just exchange them for
them really quick because these ones are all full where's your I don't think the
gold contact is the reason I mean the way they it's what's the programming on here is
what the difference is because there's only four leads on there and it comes back
into here I can try yeah I mean Alyssa I don't have time to mess with this
because I got like an interview and I got some other and that now the neighbor wants me
to teach me how to use his laminator so I'm just going to give him this shit and give
you the old shit and then you can test later on and figure it out okay thank you all right
just take that man let me know what happens if it doesn't work bring it back and we'll
figure it out I can get the OEM stuff but it's expensive yeah I can get the originals
but maybe yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah let me see if I do if I don't I can grab I can get one
oh sorry hey
I got him a Gentile yellow
shit I don't have no yet one here okay let me know
yeah call me either way and let me know man because I need to know I got a I got a contact
I've been too busy bro to fuck a dig down on it Alyssa has been trying to figure it out but I
know she sent a whole bunch of them back because it was doing the same thing to other people
so so what's that I don't I have the same machine you have next door and I can test yours
in there I just don't have time to do it right now because and it doesn't matter if it works
in mine and it doesn't work in yours I'll tell I'll have her test those in mine I'll let you know
you test those in yours and let me know you're welcome dude sorry about that sorry about the
problem huh I'm gonna say to go help with this laminate really quick yeah then I'll be over
there doing this all right man sorry so what do we laminate in this this right here
yeah okay so like what happened are you okay yeah I cut it yesterday and it wouldn't stop
bleeding didn't need stitches or anything it just wouldn't stop bleeding because of all the
blood centers and meds I take oh sure so they put up special medicine on air and put a compression
so laminating this thing like just this leading edge is shitty so like I might I might like
take this right here and like trim a clean edge before I feed it in you know like a straight edge
because when you when you go to start it and you got one corner of it's like longer whatever
than it wants to bunch up and do crazy shit so like I I would cut that straight go well I'm
well I'm working on this work on getting that cut off straight so it's it doesn't have a bow
like that and hopefully as squares you can get it you know what I mean because when you once
you put you're gonna be relying on the squareness of this initial cut to feed it in there
from that end or this end well either end but I would say this end because we have more room to
back up and forgive ourselves where if that end we're going right into the I would I would start
over here yeah for sure and then just clean this edge up and you don't want this up curl going
on you go to feed it in there it's gonna make because the dirtier it is going in the dirt
you're just gonna go through it any one of those uh dust free claws you got you got any of those
the other ones yeah we're at I see it yeah you want that cutter you have it if you want it
which cutter maybe you want to go ahead and have it take it okay it's in my way I thought I
was gonna need it I'll try it out man for sure I'll take it over there if nothing else Joe might
be able to use it but it could be something I could be hopefully shit this thing's fucking heavy dude
yeah it looks pretty good all right man so do you know how to do you feel comfortable
starting from scratch you want to start from scratch yeah all right give me a blade
don't cut the wheels somebody cut my wheels up already dude I know I can't believe
that dude this is the one that was cut I know it no mine's cut now too oh is it yeah dude I
didn't know we even used it once and I went to go use it and it was all fucked I'm tired of
man like fuck people they're just terrible man all right so sweet all right so we're gonna back
this up what the fuck is that yeah we're gonna get it as much of the dust out of the way as possible
oh nice you got one oh yeah let's try it out let me see oh god okay
damn sold
no it's a cold it's because it's cold okay
all right so tighten this up on here you got some asking tape yeah we're gonna need that
oh I went to get the rag I never got it or what there it is
if you got to dust this thing off before you use it
uh I don't think that's necessary but it wouldn't hurt it but this will work you want to have
a rag like this with you too because you can if there's any dust on it when it's going in you
can catch it before it goes in there I mean that wouldn't hurt this is the pan the ass
yes she probably she would probably be good I mean you don't want all this you don't
have to do all this every time you go to use it you know what I mean like your environment sucks
so you gotta just do what you gotta do I don't like covers because I don't like putting them on
and taking them off and yeah going back and forth okay so I mean if you ever get confused on
how to weed and look at this instruction right here yeah so it goes under here right you don't
you want to have this lifted up getting it getting it through there can be a pain in the ass but
so yeah the laminate you know obviously faces down so what I like to do I don't have my thing
anymore but I used to have a trimmer where I could I could probably use yours or you pull the
back or back here and then you slice it I know but I had one that was really thin I got another
easier cool perfect we could probably make it work so what I like to do and what I like about this
lamp oh yeah dude that's a terrible that my laminate the first day I had it they rolled over
the wheel and ripped the rip the power cord right out of the back of it dude you got to be
careful with that thing when you're when you're done with this man apparently see that I would
just pick it up and set it up here man because you roll over it back and forth the it'll rip it
out of the back of the machine and everything else oh nice hell yeah that's perfect I need to buy
one of those actually so that's perfect man so look it you want to take the material wrap it over
that roll and get it get it going back this way and pull it back here and then you can just like
when you're loading the media in the printer whatever like you can find it here or not lined up I'm
not that far yet we haven't even taped it on yet but you want to you definitely if you look at
the spindles they've all got numbers on them you know what it means like I've seen it seems to me
like when I'm running 54 I go at like around 70 I don't know if it's 70 there or is it 70 it's
the same on both sides it looks like so if you set these all to 70 then you're going to be at
least in the right ballpark it take up is a little bit skewed right here but that doesn't really
matter what matters is when we tape it on that we get it square yes 70 and this is not 70 anymore
well they're not even if it depends they're not they're not they're not even so you got to choose
aside like if you put it 70 here then 70 is not going to be or you got to figure out where it is
like I don't know that's 69 where you are over there there you go so it's 69 your favorite number
except for I'd rather have 77 well so 69 is where you want to put it okay here here here and also
with your take up reel over here that's that kills the power and that that that makes it on
okay cool so anyways look when you get back here and you see how the materials like I'm squaring
it up right there see when I pull it to the left it goes that way right to the right like there's
a certain spot where it's square you know like it's touching all the way across nice and smooth and
I'm holding it from the center okay and then I hit the lift button back here and drop the pressure
that way now it's not going to be able to move okay and when I pull on it when I'm pulling back
on it if you hold this when it's lifted up that that applies the brake what it it causes this to
lock up to where it can't you're you know you're holding on right there so you want to get it nice
and snug across there but you also have this brake so when you pull see how there's like some
braking going on here yeah go back there and feel it go to the back of the machine where I'm at
and you do it like grab that paper and pull on it with your hands and feel how it feels see that
I think that the brake should be a little stronger like maybe let me see how that feels let me see
no more that's too much like right feel that pull that
you see that now feel this dude like come over here and feel how tight that thing is right now
yeah now twist it right here you feel that pressure you need to have pressure back but not too
much it'll curl the media up like when it comes out if you got too much but you got to have negative
what that does is it keeps it taunt on the roll and it also keeps it going straight you know
what I mean because without that back pressure it'll start to walk around okay so center it up
over there like I showed you pull pressure on it like I said you can back it up you don't want
to waste your material you know what I mean so back it up to where grab it in the middle grab
with one hand in the middle now watch walk it back and forth on the on the thing go left and right
watch how it slides on the roll let leave it lighter like leave it light but you feel it yeah so
find that center point then hit the lift button over there okay it's hard to work with this you
you got to use a lot of tape with this backer I found that that clear tape works pretty good
like packing tape yeah sometimes it holds this backer better because the tape is on a stick to it
there's only there's only two pieces to it but this is the backer right here so this is going
to take the backer up so he doesn't have to deal with it
