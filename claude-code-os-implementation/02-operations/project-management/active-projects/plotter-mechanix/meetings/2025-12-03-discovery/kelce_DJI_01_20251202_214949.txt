cost you money oh yeah lots of it yeah yeah and we are trying to have all these
sips and we're just trying to make that funnel fucking me proof yeah so I got a
really good idea of your base problem now the cost of that problem based on
your experience how much is this problem whether it's due loss revenue
unexpected maintenance the labor costs the cost of business per month what would
be your estimated value on that problem just think about all the problems that
you're having how much do you think you're losing every month off of those
problems oh I don't really know I mean I'd probably only lost like $10,000 last
year it's total 10,000 last year in total oh maybe 20 okay okay maybe more but
yeah I made a lot of bad decisions last year actually okay let's just
start over the month of what we talked about the problem is the the biggest
problem is that I'm the only one that knows anything about a printer here so
if anybody calls my company out of all the fingers I have out there right now
illicit and handle supplies orders you know and basic things but at the end of
the day like I have to talk to the person I have to sell the person I have to go
fix the I have to do everything bro if I if I don't come to work we're not
making any more I see so the but the business just creeps to a halt and
within a couple of months we'd be out of business so you're right I mean like
yeah yeah illicit could do some like maintenance she's knowledgeable but
she's not the person that you know a lot of a lot of like what you do here is
selling people confidence so out of the technical work that service calls that
you get how much of that is like if you rank the technicality of that service
call out of that range then what is there a way to determine the if the
problem is at your caliber or Joe's caliber yeah or a list is caliber like
a zero oh yeah yeah yeah to some degree I mean a lot of things that I get
involved in I don't even know what I'm doing oh I've never even seen the
printer dude not even know what it is never seen it never heard of it I just
went and saw on yesterday I never scared the shit out of me dude I saw this big
giant dusty ass thing I was like it looks like a piece of garbage dude like the
heads are three thousand dollars a piece and there's twelve of them and they're
all bad and this lady wants me to save the day it's like there's no
miracle workers out there but I can't send Joe over there like I couldn't
even make something out of it you know what I mean so I don't know what I'm
getting into I just go to everything and then things happen dude and that
and that's another thing too like a lot of my opportunities that I gain
come from being out there you know so I'm like if I'm driving to this place
and then right next door as another dude I'm over there giving business cards
you know so like I was just this week I was we were coming back totally yeah
that's that is that where you find your enjoyment when you're working your
business I like going to places talking to the owners of the companies finding
where their pain points are leaving my business card and then later on I get
a call I have in this week so you know I dropped a card off this lady and then
I got a call ag me printing and I was like ag me printing I go back to my
notes I look I think I look at the address like no shit man I dropped a
business card over there like three weeks ago three months ago and now they're
calling me you mentioned your notes what do you mean where do you
where's your notes like what notes are you storing text messages history like I
went back like when I when I get a new like if I get a contact I send it to
Alyssa I say hey take a picture I send it to her I say can you add that to the
database send him an introduction email give him my contact I give him a
for me she has that process look Alyssa does that work out pretty well when he
does that when he sends you a business card to fill out I guess
when I meet him I try like I wouldn't say we're there yet but I try and I'm
I'm extremely adamant about her when she's on the phone like she can't get
their cell phone numbers but I can't I'm like hey I need your cell phone
number and I'm gonna send you a text message right now because I don't want to
be sitting in this dude's driveway where I can't get through and no one's
answering the phone you know like I'm not gonna solicit your shit or I'm not
gonna send you marketing or all that but when I send that message I'll be there
in 45 minutes like you better be there right like yeah and and and and so I I
want all of the communication to be through job but then what happens is like
people open the messages and don't do anything about it and then don't then it's
fucked you know what I mean like people read the message but don't don't handle
it and don't market as unread and then nobody sees the message so you have to
I skim the job or text messages every morning I sit in my when I sit in the
hot tub in the morning I go through job or message communications I go through
my text messages back till like a couple days because I there's things in there
I'm dealing with that aren't finished yet I have like a bunch of I don't even
look at my inbox anymore bro no I can't look at it's too much I she's she's
dealing with most of it I skim it just to make sure I'm not missing an
opportunity but the rest of it like cleaning it getting rid of the junk
males like so listen when you're going through his emails how did he get a
report of his email she calls me it's it basically if there's something that
needs to be handled I just tell their call me because otherwise I'm not looking
at my email for hours on end and text messages even I get overwhelmed
Microsoft so it's all your environments do Microsoft 365 so you have a
Microsoft 365 account yes next question timeline and future how long have
you been dealing with this particular problem and if you didn't don't take
action in the next six to twelve months what does the future of your business
look like I've been telling this problem since the beginning of time since I
first ever had a business oh it's probably been 20 years now but just you
know I thought with this drive to technology and everything things would get
more easier to do but the every piece of technology I add in my business makes
it more complicated and more messed up dude it's just there's too many pieces
like there's there's a website there's the database there's the CRM there's
the interface with the cut you know job or now we've got like all these
different things they don't have the same information so like I've got
capsule quickbooks job or Shopify all have different information some's got
some shit over here some's got it over there I got outlook I got text messages
I got a text message on my cell my business number as a text number job
as a text number I have a text number nobody calls the office hardly ever they
call my cell phone even though they out of the numbers they call myself because
they know that they're gonna get results so do you have a private number to
no no because people don't really bother me on the weekends you know like
it's just during business hours when there's money to be made I want to be
available to take the calls like I'd nothing I hate worse than calling a place
and get fucking voicemail and I don't I go to the next place bro and that's where I
get a lot of my business actually honestly the reason I get a lot of my
businesses because people call in I got her trained now to where she knows I'm
out there she knows where I'm at she's got the mapping front of her and she's
like hey Kelsey there's a call that came up in tempi I'm gonna throw on your
schedule real quick if you can make it by there today boom
bingo and I've already got like my schedule I already know who needs what who I
can push back who's not desperate and shit in their pants but see that
stuff doesn't happen unless you got a brain behind it you know that's not
happening you got to have somebody with common sense that's like okay
Kelsey's in tempi today and then this call just came in there in tempi maybe I
should call Kelsey and tell him like before I listed came along and we had
job or all this shit going on this guy over here would write it on a note I'd
be out in Mesa I'd come back tomorrow and the next day he'd be like oh yeah
Jim Bob called for me so I'm like dude I was five minutes from there yes
that you dickhead like now I'm gonna be driving for another two hours you
don't give a shit about me you show up late to work every day and then I got a
drive for four hours because of it and lose thousands of dollars like do you
see Kelsey's location on the jobber's map is it provide you a I mean she has
my cell phone right there she could look at my location I don't but as she
could I don't she doesn't need to know where I'm at she knows about where I'm at
by looking at the map because like show him what you're looking at like
jobber looks different on us what her her screen like I can't even use the
computer version of it hardly I it does more things it's more it's yeah it's
just the cell phone is more simplified I mean look what she's looking at look
at her thing I mean I can't look at all those numbers and shit it's too much
man you can filter it and turn off certain things if it's overwhelming but
I'm gonna ask you this question I want to ask you to ask Liska if there was a
magic wand solution if I gave you a magic wand and you can build a perfect no
compromise solution to fix any problem what specific tour system would that
work like that if we could get the infant for end or that would be fantastic
that's your magic wand say so because then he's gonna call me he's gonna say hey I
need you to prepare this and listen this do we have this and then I can just look
over now she's like oh do you have this she's running like back and forth
okay and what's your magic wand if you had a magic wand what would what problem
would you wait or solve with one way a reliable field tech that can go on and
alleviate 50% of my daily responsibilities because I'm just I can't do it I
got I can't do anything new I don't want to do anything like I'm trying not to
do things you know what I mean because I'm trying to like well yeah if I get
more work business to get freedom and I never really have had freedom but I'm
actually at a place now in my business because I started with basically nothing
you know I got some stubborn so no loans no nothing and so now I'm at a point
where I have steady cash flow and like I'm not at least my my worry isn't like
how I'm gonna pay for the bills or whatever like I'm not looking I have all the
things in tools I need to do what I need to do you know I have inventory I have
parts you know like I I don't want to inventory all these parts but I have
parts for jobs that I need and I I got my little niche you know but magic
wand yeah think about that while you think about that I would say like I would say
the rest when you think about it well it's it's basically just it's a it's a
it's a more centralized way of communicating like it's just really difficult to
keep track of all of the things that were going on in in the day I think that
in in most companies you have you know one person is only handling supplies and
one person's only handling this and one's only handling and that and we're
handling like we're juggling like everything all the time because we only have
the two of us really you mean and I think we're getting a lot done based on
the circumstances I'm not dissatisfied with that I'm just tired of being the
only one that's responsible all the time but at the end of the day I think
that's just the way it is as that one you're gonna end up being that guy with
the end with the with the actual customer like they're probably you know like
it's kind of stressful like I deal with a lot but I watch like you have to do
you got to do the job it's got to be reasonable for the customer to want to
pay it to you know what I mean like like if I if I go out and do a job and it
takes me three hours or I send something that's unknowledgeable doesn't know
what they're doing it takes them two days you know like who's gonna pay you
know like is the customer gonna pay for all the mistakes that that guy made
because he doesn't have 25 years of experience like that's so so if you're so
funny because we were we're talking I got 25 years of experience of tricks up
my sleeve bro so that came up with our development team yesterday how do we
charge people and so what we're doing what I haven't talked to him and now
hey guys we're gonna talk you on this subject is that my thought is same
thing for a mechanic right a mechanic has to change an alternator if we let's
say our alternator is a simple implementation of an API or build something for
a customer right I know our guys can associate that one task to an hour really
rate just like a mechanic there's a standard hourly rate to change an
alternator there's a standard hourly rate to change a wheel bearing a break you
know the same like there's I think it's the automotive industry standard of
billable hours now if that mechanic is so good because he spent 15 years
changing brakes and he can change a break in 30 minutes but they're able to
bill 2.5 hours that's the profit right same shit with you yeah I feel like we
should and this is what I want to talk to my team about is we develop our for
lack of better term hourly rate for specific jobs aka building something out
for you oh because it sounds like we have a change of a print head paper okay
paper is to say 25.25 of an hour a print head is usually at 1.75 right so you
give a denominating value for every task that will ultimately say okay this is
actually five billable hours if I get it down in three I'm making money the
customer doesn't need to know that but at least we are creating that margin so we
know fuck I spent five and a half hours I actually I didn't lose money but I
could have made more money for the next time and maybe have a system where you
can say hey next time let's do this instead of that we would have saved an hour
you know what I'm saying like be able to make your your systems your because if
we from what I'm hearing if very reconfigure out of the way to replicate you and
if all that takes is by wearing a camera while you service these printers and then
now you have a digital recording of how the ship works if you're talking to
yourself as that ready this is when I am yeah they got cameras now you can just
clip on your shirt yeah good and they're so small yeah you wouldn't even like
you would like that is bigger bigger than that yeah and now you have a digital
reference that your next service guy your next service call can follow hey well
I would like to take all those videos and put them online bro but see what's
happening right now and and you know I got Joe I hired Joe and I was like Joe
you gotta go through and post all these ads online for me post all these
printers that we have for sale we post them high you get to our name out there
but now I'm getting calls from like other states you know remote support like
I'm doing like remote telephone calls and charge people like a hundred
seventy five bucks to talk to them on the phone they're happy to pay because I
could I could I just hear you say you get paid for consulting somebody over the
phone and you don't have to leave your office yeah I could be doing that all day
long if I if I focused on that from to be honest with you dude like I'm tired
of this driving around the city and chasing all this whatever I if I could
figure out how to optimize the web right keep my service business running
down here move to pine top sit upon the porch of my pint looking at the
pine logs and sit there with my earbuds on and just be like hey what's up you
know FaceTime me let's go you know like can I have a spot up there with you and
then we can have one of those mornings together yeah but that's what I I mean
like as I'm doing more of it you know it's like remote service like I could be
somewhere else right I'm not fighting traffic back and forth and there's so
many people out there that are do it themselves or is that want to do it
themselves but they need some help you know and like how teaching people I
like I enjoy training people so what if what if we created like another version
of the polymath world right where you have become the mecca of knowledge or you
built your name about just fixing printers and there's a particular job you
necessarily don't want but you know another service tech that I have this
idea I have this repair I really don't have time for it would you be
interested in taking that work on I do it all the time I mean I I have other
guys that work for me in a contract it is not morally unacceptable it is not
morally wrong for you to do that no I I what I do is I you know like I know
what it's like like when you're caught your machine broke and you need that
thing to work and you can't get there till Tuesday but you've got a guy that
yeah I people call me with that I don't I'm not looking for the work but they'll
call me and be like hey if I'm out and I'm like hey if you have problem that
cop you're calling me and then I guess the customer service so I you know like
we we basically charge the same rate so we charge 250 for a service call and
that guy charged me 150 I make a hundred bucks he makes his rate I don't do
anything yeah the inventory like just the whole process of even taking an
order and the API thing that what's the name we're gonna like I had my hopes up
really high about it because all the shit he told me sounded great but just
the constant not seeing anything ever happened and whatever I just I just gave
up but I'll let you talk to Malik I'll reach out to him and I'll text him
let's make this very importantly aware that the reason why Kelsey did not like
his deliverable is because the frequency of conversation to you of the
status of the project because there was no status update that you can
physically see I mean I got a bunch of status updates every week but there's
nothing I nothing ever physically came to fruition you know like some bullshit
like template that didn't work and the idea behind it was good and I you know
I was throwing my ideas like I like it like this yeah that's cool oh oh you
know the website all wrong oh we got to read oh you know so now he's like
fumbling around with the website read and he and he changed a whole bunch of
stuff in the website because of what I told you about the groups or however
that shit is in there so he didn't realize how big a of a problem that was
gonna be it's not my fault he didn't know I was like look then just make it
work with like four products that I sell the most common ones just show me that
work with four that's what finally got to that and then just I was looking at
your website last night actually yeah oh it sucks too there's nothing good
about my website this is the same problem yeah but it's right here in front of
me we're gonna have the same problem with SNS full checks like we're gonna
develop their same literally legitimately the same situation although they
don't sell prints but the foundation of the overall company which company oh
your dad's company yeah same situation so I am literally starting at the
ground the foundation right and working my way up and and that's that's that's
my method of
I mean the only I do I like jobber but everything out like I have a whole
another CRM that has shitloads of emails contact information no well we
transition to jobber and it's still I still use it because I have all my
passwords in all of my yeah but not much like 40 bucks 30 bucks and it's it's
actually pretty powerful program no I agree I don't want I don't want to pay
for it if I don't have to it's a pretty powerful program but I just don't it's
too powerful you know what I mean like it's got all these capsule yeah and they
have a whole like CRM integration I'm not marketing integration where you
can do like all that AI bullshit well when I started the company over the
first time I did it I used I don't even know what I did man I I used quick
books professional eventually but an outlook and just word of mouth I built I
built that thing up what was the question you asked me just like what was the
difference that you like capsule versus oh so when I started over I was like I
had kind of like not worked for a year so like I was and I had to
relaxed and since it was my company I never I didn't really present myself as
the owner all the time because that sucks you know and I mean I just be like a I
present myself as a worker well my ex-wife owned it and I was just a worker so I
just acted like a worker I didn't you know I just kind of so when I started
over and I started like cold calling and stuff I was like calling the same
people like over in the same day like oh shit like how am I gonna keep track of
this you know so I did a little bit of research and I was like well quick book
sucks and I did some CRM research and the first one that somebody would
actually contact me and help me with was capsule so they got me on the phone
they gave me a little rundown they helped me get my information show me how to
import my that's this that's the second time I heard in two days one guy pays
40 G's a year for his software for his CRM but he does like heavy steel
fabrication I talked to him last night but he paid 40 grand a year because the
agent gave him his login walked him through the process pretty much folded his
hand for the first two months and then you got a 40 thousand dollar year
contract out of it because of it and what you're telling me is you signed up
over because of that fact then I tried to use it but I couldn't get the people I
worked with to implement and use it with me so I'm just using it alone talking
about your co-workers employees he's not here anymore but so use that my
sister long gone evolve she got it all set up for me but it was just over
complicated it did it was lacking a whole bunch of features that job her
head and she was already using job her for her husband's a carpet cleaning
business but job her doesn't do a good job with job her does no integration with
the website like you could build like a service-based website that's just like
I want my carpet clean but if you want to have products and shit they don't deal
with that so but it handled the texting from one location you know it handled
the map it handled the taking the notes you know like I'd put I'd have to
log into quick books put my notes in and then I have to go into capsule and do
some other shit and it was just too much stuff on the phone for me I'm like I
don't want to do this man like I'm tired of my phone so job her brings it all
into one location but I still but I still because of the the data being skewed
all over we haven't brought all of our garbage into job her so all of our
database still has all the shit in it and job her just has what's in QuickBooks
but I have my whole database of my old clients you know it's old now but I
still have all emails and phone numbers and all that I could be marketing and
telling them hey I'm over here hey I've got compatible links hey check this
out make videos dude like you should you should put these in your printer
because I'm gonna come over there and help you here's myself here's my number
here's my so what I'm also hearing here is that you're gonna need some sort
of media agency as well to kind of manage your videos but then also that can
turn your daily output which would be you wearing a camera yeah yeah that is
opportunity for marketing well that can all turn into something that's gonna be
web-based sales but we got to get the internal parts of it dropshipping
because like my inks for instance I could drop shit my inks directly from the
manufacturers they already have my labels I they label it so they could just
dropship it for me I could I could automate it to where an order comes in gets
paid PO gets sent over dropship information they label it ship it we don't
even have to touch it that's what I want to do so let me ask this question
before I do okay so we I don't think we're elaborated on your idea of the
magic wand can we go over that real quick oh the magic wand would just be
basically a way to get communication to happen properly I mean like every
all your systems all your getting all of my pieces to communicate with each
other so that we can communicate with each other better as a team yeah not
have 500 different fucking things here and there and whatever like I just
want one hub where I go and that's what that thing that I was building for me
was supposed to be and but I was like well his thing doesn't do all the
things jobber does so like let me let me use the jobber for my field service
stuff yeah like when she has to add a product she's got to add it into quick
books jobber shopify I've already thought of this I think when we first
talked when we print out those trifles like seven weeks ago I just didn't
know how to do it yeah I still don't know how to do it but I got guys who do
and I can't wait for them to see well Malik I'm gonna get you to talk to Malik
about what he did for me because he has all the database and all this shit
and I'm gonna I'll initiate the conversation with Malik yeah and then what I'm
gonna do is have Malik talk to the guys yeah the developers the guys who
actually know what the fuck he's talking about yeah yeah because I mean I spent a
lot of money and if there's any way to recover any of that work that he did
no no 100% we're not gonna let that go to waste for nothing okay good well
he he did a bunch of work in Shopify and he was he was struggling along but I
just couldn't keep paying to me hundred bucks a week to right so quick
question now the last one the core of the why you choose to build this business
in a tough high-stakes logistical market what's the story behind potter
mechanics and what drove you to make the direct access rental or like selling
the e-commerce like the prints and all that stuff like what drove you to do that
to start a business well why did you start the business like ultimately we
knew that you started working and servicing printers and then that just got
expanded on right well no what happened is I worked at a company for the first
10 to 12 years of my corporate life and I hated it I hated working in the
office environment I hated all the office drama and bickering that went on
there I hated the way that people acted when the boss was there and wasn't
there and I just didn't fit into that environment I I like to go out and work I
always gotten paid but I think that I was really getting out of it was a sense
of accomplishment you know what I mean so like like my wife might not like me
but my customer was happy that I fixed their printer you know what I mean so at
the end of the day like I got my fulfillment from my job and accomplishing these
things because I as a kid growing up you know like I barely graduated high school
so you know my family's like how did you become a business owner it's like I
did I have no clue and I can't tell I became an accidental entrepreneur I can't
tell a person how to do it and honestly if I had to start over again right now
after doing it two or three times I still don't know what to do I feel like you
know but I worked there I got fired all I knew how to do was fix printers and
help people and I've been doing that for the last 20 years but every time I
start doing that it generates revenue and then I need people and then it falls
apart man I don't manage them I don't manage the people properly because I'm too
busy in the business yeah and I and I want to start doing that because I
actually do like training people like I like going places where people don't
know how to do something and teaching them a better way to do it or see a way
that they're doing it like I have a clock lady right now I mean she's got a
legit clock business bro they sell custom clocks from seven inches 12
inches 15 like a pizza do all the up to 36 custom printed on wood and these
printers are expensive a hundred thousand dollars well they're they're they're
dilapidated one is in complete disarray and it needs like probably 20
thousand dollars with a work to get it to run again or she could buy that
printer over there for 10 grand get some nice material and change your
process so
