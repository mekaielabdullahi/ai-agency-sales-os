# Stakeholder Interview - Joe De La Cruz
**Date:** January 28, 2026
**Attendees:** Joe De La Cruz (Printer Tech), Matthew Kerns, Chris Andrade, Mekaiel Abdullahi
**Type:** Stakeholder Interview - Technical Deep Dive
**Recording:** [View on Fathom](https://fathom.video/share/dxKy89jNjTXytKHC68ioAzsmgyNCQKeH)

## Meeting Purpose
Interview technician Joe to map daily workflows, identify pain points, and uncover opportunities for the Plotter Mechanix automation system.

## Key Takeaways

1. **Critical Data Discrepancy:** The Shopify-to-Jobber workflow for supplies is broken. Shopify tracks paper by the box (2 rolls), while Jobber tracks it by the roll. This manual calculation causes 2–3 under-deliveries monthly, each requiring a 2-hour fix.

2. **Training Bottleneck:** Kelsey's training is effective but inefficient. Joe prefers self-paced video tutorials for technical repairs, as they allow for review and better absorption than Kelsey's fast-paced, in-person method.

3. **Untapped Revenue:** A significant opportunity exists in offering print services to non-competitor clients (e.g., tint shops, CAD offices) who ask for them. This is currently declined to avoid upsetting print shop clients.

4. **Knowledge Base is Key:** A centralized knowledge base is the top priority. It would provide on-demand access to procedures, troubleshooting flowcharts, and post-repair steps, enabling Joe to work more independently.

## Daily Workflow & Coordination

### Morning Prep (1.5–2 hrs)
- Checks email for CAD print jobs
- Sends 30–120 page CAD sets (avg. 3/day)
- **Pain Point:** Mismatched file sizes can extend setup from 15 mins to 3 hrs
- **Optimization:** Discovered "Medium Quality" print setting is visually identical to "High Quality" but prevents printer errors and speeds up file flattening

### Delivery Prep (15–20 mins)
- Checks Jobber for paper/ink deliveries (avg. 1x/week)
- **Pain Point:** Manual transfer from Shopify to Jobber is required due to the box-vs-roll discrepancy

### Service Call Coordination
- Daily route planning with Kelsey and Alyssa often changes based on new requests
- **Pain Point:** This morning coordination is the most frustrating and time-consuming part of the day

## Service Call Execution & Challenges

### Tech Proficiency
- **Confident:** HP printers (70–80% of calls), Graphtec cutters, print head/cartridge issues, encoder strip/belt replacements
- **Less Confident:** Solvent printers (Muto, Mimaki), Epson, large-format flatbeds, UV curable printers, and ink tube assemblies

### Troubleshooting Process
- **Primary:** Consult service manuals (often pre-studies and notes page numbers)
- **Secondary:** Call Kelsey for help
- **Frequency:** Calls Kelsey for help on ~20% of jobs; needs minor redirection on another 10–15%

### Kelsey's Distractions
- Kelsey's phone calls/texts cause deviations on ~80% of shared service calls, each costing 3–5 minutes
- **Proposed Solution:** Train Alyssa to screen calls, allowing Kelsey to focus

## Training & Knowledge Gaps

- **Initial Onboarding:** Required 20–30 hours/week of Kelsey's time for the first 3 months
- **Preferred Training Method:** Self-paced video tutorials
  - Rationale: Allows for review and better absorption than Kelsey's fast-paced, in-person method
- **Top 3–5 Video Topics:**
  - Technical parts replacements
  - Diagnostics flowcharts
  - Post-repair steps (e.g., service mode procedures)
- **New Tech Onboarding:** Joe estimates a full day (8 hrs) is needed to walk a new tech through the office printers and interfaces

## Missed Opportunities & Process Improvements

### Print Services
- **Opportunity:** Offer print services (e.g., labels) to non-competitor clients (e.g., tint shops, CAD offices)
- **Challenge:** This is currently declined to avoid upsetting print shop clients, despite being a clear revenue stream

### CAD Print Pricing
- **Suggestion:** Add a setup fee for complex CAD files requiring >30 mins of manual work
- **Rationale:** Current pricing ($1.50–$1.75/page) is far below competitors (e.g., FedEx at $4.75/page) and likely doesn't cover the high consumables cost (ink, print heads)

### Jobber Data Integrity
- **Problem:** Jobber records often lack a client's full equipment list
- **Solution:** Allow technicians to update client profiles in the field by adding photos of equipment and serial numbers

### Field Knowledge Access
- **Current:** Remote desktop access or calling Alyssa
- **Desired:** A mobile tool (like a RAG agent) for instant answers on procedures, troubleshooting, and post-repair steps

## Action Items

- [ ] **Chris:** Deliver camera + mic to Joe; set up workstation for future interviews
- [ ] **Matthew:** Create interview feedback page; send link to Joe; notify Chris + Mekaiel when ready
- [ ] **Mekaiel:**
  - Prioritize building the knowledge base with video tutorials and flowcharts for Joe's top 3–5 requested topics
  - Investigate automating the Shopify-to-Jobber workflow to eliminate manual calculations and prevent under-deliveries

## Next Steps

1. Build knowledge base with priority on video tutorials and troubleshooting flowcharts
2. Investigate and fix the Shopify-to-Jobber data discrepancy issue
3. Setup proper workstation for Joe for future remote collaboration
4. Create feedback form to capture additional insights post-interview
