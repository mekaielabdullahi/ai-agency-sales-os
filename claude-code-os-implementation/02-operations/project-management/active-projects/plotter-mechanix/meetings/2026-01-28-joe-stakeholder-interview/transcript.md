0:13 - Chris Andrade
  Are you guys playing hide-and-seek again? Whatever you want me to do. 10, 1, 2, 3, 4, 7, 8, 9, We made big improvements today, bro.  Big improvements. I think we kind of just unlocked, oh, you're on mute. We unlocked a whole new way of getting shoot done today.

1:12 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
  Yeah, I think we moved forward to client projects, like, really well.

1:16 - Chris Andrade
  Technically, yeah, I mean, and then, so maybe we turn Wednesdays, not into just meeting manager days, like no meetings, but maybe we go, we've been making the whole time.  That's true, yeah.

1:29 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
  We've moving stuff forward. Yeah, maybe we just confuse making with meeting and make them both.

1:37 - Chris Andrade
  Yeah. Oh, is this like the task, your task checker? Yeah, well, this is the man-hour factor calculator.

1:48 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
  threw it into Autocloud and got it to persist data and then refactored the code. And then, so this is from what I did?  Yeah, pulled in the repository. So now, and then I just merged in the first two work trees. And then I now I'm enabling the next one.  So there's multi scenario comparison on the roadmap.

2:15 - Chris Andrade
  And then I'm gonna add these other things to like imagine when we can start like, so Alyssa is going to be iteration one, like her SOP is going to create a task list, that task list will then have a matrix that can be associated to a time of completion when we create when we she hits that checkmark.  That's the start and stop clock to the man hour factor, right? And obviously, there's gonna be a little bit of error.  But if we just get her to consistently keep doing the same thing, it's going to get more accurate, more accurate, more accurate.  Right? Yeah.

2:58 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
  Oh, this is beautiful.

3:00 - Chris Andrade
  So this is autoclawed, huh? Okay, yeah. Yeah. One day I'll get to that level, bro. One day.

3:10 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
  So now it's going to be working on all this stuff. Guided Discovery, Workflow Mode, CEF to Revenue Translation Engine.  Customer Experience Factor to Revenue Translation Engine.

3:23 - Chris Andrade
  That's what I'm talking about. Yeah.

3:28 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
  The numbers. Dude.

3:32 - Chris Andrade
  Shareable link generation and PDF export.

3:35 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
  So that's good stuff. And then I got this one working on the N8N Workflows we talked about yesterday for the acquisition funnel upgrades.

3:50 - Chris Andrade
  Are you guys watching Spider-Man? My son got to stay home from school today because they're testing juniors. and � so  The test team. Oh, nice.

4:03 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
  All right, ready for me to send in this invite?

4:08 - Chris Andrade
  Yep.

4:09 - Mekaiel Abdullahi
  Yeah. I'm going to stop sharing my screen though.

4:14 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
  Are we going to need him to share a screen at all or no?

4:17 - Mekaiel Abdullahi
  Yeah, we can.

4:18 - Chris Andrade
  If we need any, like, walkers.

4:21 - Mekaiel Abdullahi
  Yeah.

4:22 - Chris Andrade
  Yes.

4:22 - Mekaiel Abdullahi
  We'll just keep it open, you know?

4:27 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
  Yep. All right, I just sent it to him.

4:45 - Chris Andrade
  You guys like this new setup, bro? So you see this mother tree right here? I got that for my 40th birthday party.  was like a little baby, a little bonsai, because I love bonsais. Now I get to create a clipping for each family member.  to I You And that's what this is a propagation. So each family member is going to get their own version of my family tree.

5:11 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
  Nice.

5:16 - Chris Andrade
  My daughter's home now. Man, don't you wish on Wednesdays you guys got home every early release on every Wednesday?  Spoiled kids, dude.

5:27 - Mekaiel Abdullahi
  Those are the good days, bro. Give me a start. Did you get that early release every Wednesday, too?

5:34 - Chris Andrade
  I think we got a late start.

5:36 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
  We got a late start, one hour late.

5:46 - Chris Andrade
  We got a late start, one hour Okay. Do you want to see it? nice you don't want it then only like  I wonder how we can, I need to turn my settings where you can auto join. Oh, you can name the meeting right here from the bottom left.  No. Maybe. I'm doing a call. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. You I was just seeing, were you able to get that link?  Yeah, I had it. Okay, just drawing when you're ready, sir. We're waiting for you. Cool. Thank you. Take your time.  What did you say, Matt?

7:33 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
  I was going to say he might get interrupted because he might be kind of busy because Kelsey's out. But we'll see.

7:39 - Chris Andrade
  He just didn't check his phone.

7:44 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
  That's another thing with Kelsey, too, is that they don't, yeah.

7:48 - Chris Andrade
  So Kelsey overchecks his phone, and because he overchecks his phone when he's with clients, it creates him to be longer.  His service calls longer. He... He... This happened twice with him, with me, so I almost feel like the wish was a way to automatically engage airplane mode when he goes to service calls, and then if it's an emergency, they have his private number, where Alyssa or some key person can get in touch with it.  Okay. Because he, because he gets distracted, because he's trying to do too many things at once, and I feel like if he had a way, if his phone didn't ring, he would just focus on getting it done, getting in and out of there, and he would save time.

8:47 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
  Yeah, 100%.

8:56 - Chris Andrade
  Mm-hm.-hm. I don't see anything. Let's go, Joe. Oh, I need my cord. Thank you. The Feds hold the interest rate steady.  Thanks. Do you have any difficulties? So this is why it was nice, Matt, with that virtual assistant meeting. She had the interview all set up.  The interviewer was informed. She gave a little introduction to what I'm going to do with the interviewing, what's happening with the interviewing, got all everything set up, and then brought in Mr.  Brian, and that was so dope.

11:16 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
  Yeah, well, this one, kind of get an ad hoc.

11:22 - Chris Andrade
  One day we'll get there. Yeah. We still need to figure out a game plan for him, Matthew. We have Mikael, and we filled in Mikael about that situation.  Like, I think that's a money, like a really good revenue machine right now.

11:44 - Mekaiel Abdullahi
  For, what was this for? You met a guy, I met a tenant.

11:51 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
  Virtual assistant company.

11:53 - Mekaiel Abdullahi
  Go wherever. I pulled, I actually pulled that into, and I put it in Notion. I forgot his name, but.  Yeah.

12:03 - Chris Andrade
  Oh, there's Joe. Joe, how you doing, sir? You're on mute. You're on mute, Joe. There we go. Hello. How you doing, buddy?  Good, good. Yourself?

12:20 - Joed De La Cruz
  Good, good. So a quick question.

12:23 - Chris Andrade
  Is there any way to get us on a computer? Does your computer have speaker or anything like that?

12:33 - Joed De La Cruz
  Actually, yes, I might.

12:38 - Chris Andrade
  It doesn't have no camera. Is that important, guys? But it has a speaker? Nope.

12:44 - Joed De La Cruz
  I mean, it has a speaker, yeah. So you can hear us and we can talk to you.
  ACTION ITEM: Deliver camera + mic to Joed; set up workstation for future interviews - WATCH: https://fathom.video/share/dxKy89jNjTXytKHC68ioAzsmgyNCQKeH?timestamp=767.9999

12:48 - Chris Andrade
  We just can't see you.

12:53 - Joed De La Cruz
  I might not be able to talk. I don't think it has a mic. Oh, yeah. Yeah. You don't have a microphone.

12:58 - Chris Andrade
  All right. No worries. I'll get... I'll set up for the future. Guys, I'll get that set for the future.  I'll get that implemented where we can. Because I want to turn your workstation into a legit workstation. You know what saying?  Nice.

13:13 - Joed De La Cruz
  Yeah. Awesome. Go ahead, Mekaiel.

13:15 - Chris Andrade
  What's up, Joe? How's it going? Good, good.

13:18 - Joed De La Cruz
  Thanks for taking the time.

13:20 - Mekaiel Abdullahi
  Matthew's on the call, too. We heard a lot of good things about you and all the good work you're doing, especially with the Apache rental job.  We're building in some new tools for the business, as you know, and we're here to just make sure they actually help you in the field.  Today's call should take about like 30 minutes or so. And your honest feedback and answers help us, you know, build the right things.  So we're just trying to get some metrics and validation and detailed processes from you. So we're just going to go through some interview questions and just do your best to try to, you know, just give us as much detail as possible.  We'll ask a follow If we need to, if we're moving too fast or slow, just let us know and we'll just get started.  How does that sound? Cool.

14:06 - Joed De La Cruz
  Sounds good. Awesome. So just walk me, just act like I know nothing.

14:10 - Mekaiel Abdullahi
  I do know a little bit, but just walk me through your typical day from when you start to when you wrap up.  How do you get your schedule? How many jobs? What happens in between those jobs? And just take me through your workflow.

14:24 - Joed De La Cruz
  So I usually try to get here around 8 or 9 to the office. So I come to the office.  I usually unlock everything. I turn everything on. I'll check my email first before anything. Make sure there's no print jobs.  The CAD print jobs are the easier ones per se, because I could send them and be doing other things while they're printing.  So I usually like to check the print jobs. If there's anything new to catch up with anything else from the day before.  Yeah. Joed, I'm going to, I'm going to, I might be interrupting you to try to get like details out of you.  So, on.

15:00 - Mekaiel Abdullahi
  Please bear with me. Can you take me through what a CAD is, just really quickly? CAD?

15:07 - Joed De La Cruz
  It's like the architectural plans that people want. They come in different sizes. And how many of those do you print in there?

15:20 - Mekaiel Abdullahi
  Like the sizes? Or like how many of those orders do you get in the morning on average?

15:26 - Joed De La Cruz
  On average, there's usually like, I want to say like three sets a day. On average, sometimes there's none at all.  Sometimes there's way more. But on average, I'd say it's like about three sets. And that's anywhere from like 30 to 120 pages per set to print out.

15:46 - Mekaiel Abdullahi
  So you walk in, check the email, get those started if there are any in the queue. And how long does that take you?  And the big thing, I'm sorry, like this first, the big thing I'm going to be asking is time on task and how long it takes you.  It's just to get like

16:01 - Joed De La Cruz
  So I would say, on average, from the time I get to the office and check everything and send a print, I'd like to say, on average, it's around 20 minutes or Because I have to double check that the sizes are good.  Sometimes they'll send files that have different sizes in the file, so I have to work around that. It's easier when they send just a single size, and then all the papers are printed the same size.  That'll usually take around 15.

16:52 - Chris Andrade
  When you have to set up those files, I know exactly what you're talking about, it is a pain. Yeah.

16:59 - Joed De La Cruz
  Do you...

17:00 - Chris Andrade
  Do extra, or is there like another category where, cause that's, there's technically a document set up now. Right. And that, that, that takes more time.  You guys don't have a way to designate that. Correct.

17:17 - Joed De La Cruz
  Um, not really. I think Alyssa just adds it to the, like, as a line item by the size and those already have pricing.  Okay. Thank you.

17:28 - Chris Andrade
  Yeah.

17:29 - Joed De La Cruz
  Um, but yeah, I'll, I'll usually just send those, make sure that everything's going to come out the same size pretty much.  And that takes about 15 minutes by the time I send the print. Sometimes it'll take way longer because, um, the files will be like, um, yeah, mismatched or just the sizes don't, don't match on like correctly.  And sometimes it trips out the printer. It'll print like stuff sideways or upside down or just cut it off or something like that.  Got it. And.

18:00 - Mekaiel Abdullahi
  Just backing up really quick, are you 40 hours a week full time? Yeah. Okay, so getting around 8, the first task you do is check those CAD printings, 20 minutes or so to get the however many sets you do, and what else?

18:16 - Chris Andrade
  Hold on real quick, Joe, those CAD files, those ones that you're printing, how many types of clients are there?  Are they more architectural, engineers, contractors? What do those types of clients look like? I believe they're architectural clients.

18:36 - Joed De La Cruz
  We usually have two consistent ones, which is McDermott and Rouser, I believe. They're the most consistent, sending big batches almost every week.  How many batches do you think a week? About one good batch, max. I think a few weeks ago they sent like three big batches.  One. What is a good batch? And what is a bad batch? A small one, I'd say it would be like two or three sets.  And then a bigger batch would be more like five, five to 10. Thank you.

19:15 - Chris Andrade
  Yeah. And are those how many pages per batch?

19:20 - Joed De La Cruz
  On average, 30 to 120. 120 being like a bigger, bigger set.

19:28 - Chris Andrade
  What's what's the average print time per page? Do you think rough estimate for it?

19:39 - Joed De La Cruz
  Well, there's a little process. So when I send the file, it wants to flatten it that takes depending on on how big how many pages there are, it usually takes about like 15 or 20 seconds to flatten it and then send it but say like there's 100 on 100 pages, it'll take 20 20 seconds 100 times.  And then by the time it sends it to the printer, the printer is pretty quick with it. The printer will actually print like, I think like 30 pages a minute.  Something like that.

20:09 - Chris Andrade
  And then does that also staple them? Yeah.

20:15 - Joed De La Cruz
  After that I have to, I just double check. I get them nice and clean and like stacked. And then I'll staple it.

20:23 - Chris Andrade
  How often does the flattening process get interrupted and then you have to segment the flattening process in batches? It happened a few times.

20:37 - Joed De La Cruz
  Not so often. would say like 20% of the time it'll happen. The other 80% it goes in through smoothly, but it's, I realized and I figured out that it was one of the print settings that we were having.  Where we were sending it as high quality, where it would take way longer to flatten it, but I just put it to me.  Medium quality, which there's no optical difference, and it takes way faster. It hasn't filled me since. So how does that set up?

21:09 - Chris Andrade
  So do you have to initiate those settings every page, or are they already set up and remembered?

21:16 - Joed De La Cruz
  No, they're set up. There's like a preset with the whole plan or the whole file, and it moves on to forward with all the other files.  That is very helpful information.

21:27 - Chris Andrade
  Thank you very much. Yeah.

21:34 - Mekaiel Abdullahi
  That is your first task of the day, right?

21:38 - Joed De La Cruz
  Yeah, usually. Okay. What else? After that, I'd say I like to double check on any deliveries that I have to make, or usually Alyssa will do a good job scheduling my day, so I just double check with that.  And then on my side, I usually like to check if there's any paper deliveries that I have to make or that I can make.  And how do you get that information? She either has it on the schedule sometimes or if she's not here yet, I'll go into the computer and go to Shopify.  Okay, where is that schedule posted? Sorry?

22:19 - Mekaiel Abdullahi
  Where is that schedule posted? Is it on a board or something? On Jobber.

22:23 - Joed De La Cruz
  On Jobber, okay. Yeah, she'll put it on Jobber. Okay. Yeah, and I usually like to get whatever I can or help her even like make an invoice if she hasn't done it yet and then get the paper ready and put it all in the car.  On these deliveries, right? Yeah. Okay. There's ink and paper deliveries. Got it. And how long does it take you to get organized for the day?  From the time I get to the office, I'd say like around a good two hours, hour and a half.  Okay. Yeah. Um, because sometimes there'll be like last minute calls or- Or- And Kelsey wants me to go do it, and I have to reroute my day and all.  So on average, what time do you leave the office for those deliveries?

23:11 - Mekaiel Abdullahi
  And do those happen every day?

23:16 - Joed De La Cruz
  Not so much. Not the deliveries. I'd say maybe once or twice a week. Got it. More like once a week we usually do deliveries.  Yeah. Nice.

23:26 - Chris Andrade
  And how many times does when if Alyssa, for whatever reason, because she gets too busy and doesn't update the job or task, how many times does that happen per week for you?

23:41 - Joed De La Cruz
  Not so much. safe space. This just stays between us.

23:46 - Chris Andrade
  We probably should have let you know that. This is a safe space. Nothing's kind of leaving this area, this conversation, etc.  This is just between us and you. I would say not so much.

23:59 - Joed De La Cruz
  She does a really good job. I'm prepping everything the day before. So the next morning I come in, it's usually mostly there.  If anything, it's going to be new orders that come in later in the night or that same morning that I'm taking care of, usually.  And just to get ahead of the day, pretty much.

24:20 - Chris Andrade
  Is there anything that you see missing in just that portion of it? Just to get your schedules, just to get your, what you're going to do or deliveries.  Is there something missing in that portion? I would just say, no, not really.

24:43 - Joed De La Cruz
  I would just say it'd be helpful, like just to have more automation with the orders. Because instead of me having to like log in, turn on the computer, like go to Shopify and then translate that to Jobbrew.  Something confusing that they do is... On Shopify, they have the paper, they have it by the box. So every box has two rows.  And on Jobber, they have it by the row. So it's just unnecessary calculations and stuff that I have to make and make sure everything matches up, the customer's there and all that.

25:17 - Chris Andrade
  Has there ever been where paper was either over-delivered or materials under-delivered?

25:24 - Joed De La Cruz
  Yeah, many times, under-delivered because of that, I'd say.

25:29 - Chris Andrade
  So we didn't give them what they paid for and then we kind of pissed them off because they didn't get that.  then we have to waste resources to go back and give it. Exactly, yeah. How many times a week or month does that happen?

25:44 - Joed De La Cruz
  In a month, I'd say maybe a couple times, two or three times.

25:49 - Chris Andrade
  And so just an average time to fix that, to redo that, to go there and back, I'd say two hours.

26:02 - Joed De La Cruz
  Yeah, and I'd say mostly for, well, we try to usually put it on our route, but it still takes time Right, right, right But we don't have a mad customer Yeah, unless it's like urgent that they need it Thank you Nice That's really good, Joed.  Um, what else?

26:29 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
  I was kind of wondering about that, uh, just real quick, like, how much, um, I guess, like, how much time does it take for you to make sure that just do that verification process and make sure that the order looks right when you're doing that from Shopify to Jobber A good, uh, 15 or 20 minutes, I'd say, because the warehouse, I mean, the office is on that side and then the warehouse is on this side So even having to, like, come and look at the paper, make sure it's here

27:00 - Joed De La Cruz
  It loaded up and then double check everything on. I like to double and triple check just to be safe because it's happened before.  And on Jobber and Shopify, like I have to match everything to the customer, their email, their company, and the order.  Nice.

27:17 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
  Okay. And that's per order, right? Okay. Thanks. Yeah.

27:24 - Mekaiel Abdullahi
  Thanks, Joed. So just to review so far, make sure I got everything you walk in, open up the store, check the CAD printer, get those orders, sets off, go do kind of like a reconnaissance for the day to get your orders and deliveries together.  Yeah. Does that sound right?

27:43 - Joed De La Cruz
  Yeah. What else?

27:45 - Mekaiel Abdullahi
  During that, it's usually when Alyssa or Kelsey will be here.

27:48 - Joed De La Cruz
  If Kelsey is not here already, but we'll just go over the service calls. That's usually what we have most of the time service calls.  And we'll just kind of plan out. Even sometimes, even if they're on my schedule already or on Kelsey's schedule already, we still plan out and sometimes interchange some things that make our route a little better.  Okay. And what is that? real quick, Mekaiel, can I elaborate on that real quick?

28:14 - Chris Andrade
  So, cause this is kind of like a crucial part. When you guys are planning out how or what dictates the plan?  Like, is it the importance of the customer? Is it the material? Like what dictates the plan and the level of importancy?  Like, do you go the farthest way out first and then work your way back in? How does that look?  There's a couple of factors.

28:42 - Joed De La Cruz
  So if it's like a slower day where there's not so many service calls, so many service calls being like over three or four service calls, I'll go ahead and take care of that.  So Kelsey could just be here and, and, and just be calmer and like work on other things. Um, but the.  The other factor would be my experience with it. I'm pretty knowledgeable in most of the things I'd say, but there's some things I haven't had my hands on yet.  Certain printers like, I want to say like Epson or like the solvent printers. I'm more familiar with HP and GravTech or cutters.  Can you elaborate on solvent printers?

29:22 - Chris Andrade
  What's a solvent printer? Solvent printer.

29:25 - Joed De La Cruz
  So there's latex being most of HP is, I think it's water-based. And just the whole mechanics or engineering of the HP is just easier to handle, I think, or more straightforward.  Whereas solvent is a little more fragile sometimes. So things like the encoder strip inside of the printer, it'll dissolve if you wipe it with Windex or something.  Whereas HP won't really do that. But solvent basically is, I think it's like oil-based ink. Whereas... Latex is water, more water-based.

30:02 - Chris Andrade
  You know, are, are there any other categories that printers will fall into? Is it just either water-based or oil-based?  Is there another category?

30:11 - Joed De La Cruz
  Well, there's, there's EcoSolvent, which is, I guess, is like a safer or healthier, like, way of it. There's latex, and I, I think that's mostly, like, the big general ones.  Gotcha. Thank you. I appreciate that. Thank you.

30:32 - Chris Andrade
  Okay.

30:32 - Mekaiel Abdullahi
  So you listed a few brands of printers. You said you're most familiar with HP and more comfortable with those types of jobs.  What were the brands of printers that you're not familiar with? And what type of, so when you do go on a printer job, what type of documentation or resources do you take with you to help you?

30:55 - Joed De La Cruz
  not with When I go on service calls, when ... I usually, when I know it's an HP, I usually don't say nothing because they're like all cousins pretty much, and I'm pretty familiar with it, I'd say, but when it's, I'm trying to remember, it's mostly with cutters that if they're like a different brand other than GravTech, I like to look at the user manual before I leave or send it to myself through emails.  Plus, could have it on my phone if I need it. How much time does that take you to do that, to get that, find that, send it?  A couple of minutes, no more than five, I'd say. Thank you. Other brands of printers at the top of my head, like Muto, Mimaki, Epson.  I don't really like working with Epson, because I'm not too familiar with it. And . . . . .  . And other bigger like trainers like flatbeds or UV curable, I'm not familiar with none of that as of now, but HP or latex, I'm pretty confident with.

32:14 - Chris Andrade
  curious, which ones get more, get to be able to charge more? Like if you can work on this brand, you can charge level tier three pricing.  I'd say the solvent printers probably more.

32:33 - Joed De La Cruz
  I see them less in the field or people have them less, but they're just, their quality of print and it usually takes even more service too, more manual service.  You could charge a lot more for those, I think, and flatbeds, UV curable. Those are like the big guys.

32:55 - Mekaiel Abdullahi
  Thanks. Um, so going back to the daily workflow and when. when. And you're planning with Kelsey. Can you walk me through a little bit more of the process of how you guys plan out the service calls?  Like what happens and what kind of triggers it?

33:13 - Joed De La Cruz
  Usually it all will have to do with more with Kelsey. And well, the factor is going to be Kelsey usually.  And like, if I'm already going to be out doing service, he'll be and he just has like one service call.  He'll be like, go, go ahead and take care of it. The other factor would be, again, like I said, the experience, if I'm not familiar with it, Kelsey would usually take over and take care of it.  And sometimes, you know, just, that's pretty much it. I'd say just up to Kelsey, usually. Got it. I'm already, I'm usually already going out doing service calls.  He'll, he'll add one on to me or, or he'll have me take kids over or something. Let's care it then.  Okay,

34:00 - Chris Andrade
  Kelsey described this scenario to me, and it made me think about it when you had, I don't know what it was, but you were working on a printer that you never had, and you needed Kelsey's help, so he was on his way over to you, and he said when you rolled up, you already had the covers off, you had everything ready to go, all of the, like it was ready for him to show up, undo the technical stuff.  Show you how to do it, and he was in and out of there in like 15 minutes, right?

34:35 - Joed De La Cruz
  Yeah, well no, more like an hour, but helping, he helped me like a good 15 minutes, and he was just taking like service calls and, or like phone calls and all that.  Okay. But yeah, that was the easiest.

34:50 - Chris Andrade
  I was just trying to get to the point of, because you were there to anticipate and get everything ready, where all he had to do was show up, been, I'm half  Did you find that beneficial and something that you thought you would like to expand on or opportunity to learn?

35:12 - Joed De La Cruz
  Yeah, I think so. Because the general aspect of just taking the covers off or getting to the part that I need to, it's pretty common sense.  But like the more technical part of replacing the part or the next steps after, I think is really beneficial.  And it was really helpful that I was there with him that day or that he helped me.

35:33 - Chris Andrade
  Is there a way that we can try to align service calls to replicate that instance? Like, is there a way that you think in your head that you can come up with to make that not only a learning experience, but also, you know, a profitable experience at the same time?  Because, like you said...

36:00 - Joed De La Cruz
  Kelsey's able to show up and help you but then also take service calls in the meanwhile overseeing the project he's able to do two maybe three things at once right yeah I would say um we tried it a couple of times where we would leave it at the end like my service call was or like the end of my route was closer to his service call or vice versa and and we the plan would be like two to meet up right after our last service call on on that last one so I mean those those two times it didn't work because another another service call came up like last minute and I just had to take care of it which was fine because it still saved us some time instead of like going all the way back out there the next day but that that was the plan pretty much for for those two times thank you

37:01 - Mekaiel Abdullahi
  Matthew, anything you want to add to the daily process or workflow?

37:08 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
  No, I think I'm good for that. Okay, anything else on your date, Joed?

37:17 - Mekaiel Abdullahi
  So after service calls, what usually happens? And then we'll get into some speedrun questions. I just want to get a good idea of start to finish, you know?

37:26 - Joed De La Cruz
  Yeah, after, I mean, just scheduling like my day pretty much here in the office and being in agreement with everybody pretty much, I go ahead and do the service calls.  Sometimes they'll be like last minute service calls or service calls that are on the way that just come up.  And I take care of those usually. After all the service calls, I'd say I just, I usually like to come back to the office, make sure there's any, no other printing stuff that I could set up for the next day or do at that same time.  Or anything that I could organize usually and prepare me for Awesome.

38:02 - Mekaiel Abdullahi
  And your main way to be dispatched is through Jobber correct? Yeah. Got it.

38:09 - Joed De La Cruz
  Yeah.

38:09 - Mekaiel Abdullahi
  And what's the most frustrating or the time-wasting part of your day? Like if you had to say one thing that wastes the most time or you find the most frustrating?

38:20 - Joed De La Cruz
  I would say the, the prepping in the morning and waiting for like everybody or, or waiting for agreement, if that makes sense.  Like, instead of just like, why do you wait for everybody?

38:34 - Chris Andrade
  Can you elaborate on that again? Why do you wait on everybody?

38:36 - Joed De La Cruz
  Because I'm not, I'm not 100% sure every single day that even if it's in my schedule, like that, that's what we're doing.  Sometimes it'll change up or Kelsey will, will change something up or add something. Um, and when does that typically happen?  Just because of the most of the time, like, yeah, like four days out of the five days of the week.  No, I'm saying like.

39:00 - Chris Andrade
  So why do they change? What happens to make those changes so sporadically?

39:09 - Joed De La Cruz
  I would say it's just sometimes it's more beneficial for Kelsey or sometimes even for me or for just in general for the service calls going like far out like to Avondale or something or Scottsdale and having that same service call that came in or having a service call that I could take care of instead of Kelsey.  So I think that's in the morning sometimes the most consuming because even if we have everything set up like it'll change.  things change based off the requests, is that right? Right, yeah.

39:49 - Mekaiel Abdullahi
  Okay, so it's the planning and the coordination. So yeah, got it. So just a brief, what did you do before Plotter Mechanics and  What kind of equipment have you worked on over your career?

40:05 - Joed De La Cruz
  I was just with my dad. He has a print shop or like a sign business, like a small sign business, and he had a HP latex, which right there, like, I self-taught everything I know from HP pretty much.  Nothing technical or like, like replacing parts, but just like how to pair or like service the printer in general.  And the cutter we had was a, it's called US Cutter. It's like a, like a lower end cutter. And we've, we've worked with those since, since I started, I think it was like in 20, 2014, 2013, where my dad got those machines and, and we started working with that.  I started helping him. Got it.

40:52 - Mekaiel Abdullahi
  How about like outside of, uh, prints and printers and cutters? Um, what kind of things are you comfortable with?  Are you using like any AI? Are you kind of like your... Like software-based?

41:07 - Joed De La Cruz
  Yeah. Well, that one service call that I think Kelsey mentioned to you guys with the Chinese software and stuff, that's something I'm really, really familiar with because that's how I grew up with.  What's it called? Do you know the name? called Vinyl Master is the software and the cutter is from U Cutter High End 3.  And wait, what was your question? Sorry.

41:36 - Mekaiel Abdullahi
  I was saying like outside of like all the software and cutters, like what kind of technology are you comfortable with?  Are you using any AI tools? Are you playing around? Are you... I'm just trying to get a sense of kind of like how comfortable you are around technology and software.  It seems like from what we've heard, like, you know, you're pretty adaptable and open-minded and have... Pretty resourceful, actually.  So I'm just trying to get a gauge and idea of All right. What kind of other tools you use on your day-to-day for work, personal, whatever it may be?

42:05 - Joed De La Cruz
  Right. So personal would be like where it all started, like technology-wise, was that, the Vinyl Master. Software was where I try to find ways and ways around it to work with it.  Any other software? Recently, it's been Adobe Illustrator. I'm not too familiar with Photoshop or most of the other ones, but Adobe Illustrator, because I use it with my dad.  It's something I'm pretty, pretty familiar with, I'd say. And outside of that, like recent stuff, like ChatGPT and all that.

42:40 - Chris Andrade
  So on a scale of one to five in Illustrator, what do you give yourself? Like if, like, just to be able to, yeah, just in general, what do you give yourself a score?  That's tough.

42:52 - Joed De La Cruz
  I'd say like a five or six.

42:55 - Chris Andrade
  So out of five, you're like expert, bro. Like you, you know. All the tools, you know, you know, every little inch of Illustrator.  No, I don't.

43:07 - Joed De La Cruz
  Okay. Okay.

43:08 - Chris Andrade
  So, so then off of that, what, what number do you think you're off of that?

43:13 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
  Were you saying five, five out of 10 or five or six?

43:16 - Joed De La Cruz
  Five out of 10. No, I'm sorry.

43:19 - Chris Andrade
  What a scale from one to five. My apologies. Oh, one to five.

43:23 - Joed De La Cruz
  Yes, sir. My fault. My fault. Like a three. I'd say like a three.

43:26 - Chris Andrade
  Okay. And that's perfect. That's what I just needed to know. And there's no other Adobe products that you're familiarized in.  You said you're not getting, you don't really have a background in Photoshop, After Effects, any of those? Not as of now.

43:43 - Joed De La Cruz
  I work with, well, cause I go to like a church and, and that's where everything, like the technological thing, like kind of caught my eye.  Because I, over there, I use a lot of, um, a lot of softwares that, that are, um, computer. let's go to the toolbar.  So, yeah, I think I'm pretty, like, good with technology.

44:31 - Chris Andrade
  Would you find it beneficial for Plotter Mechanics if you learn more Illustrator, and if there's so, what particular part of Illustrator would you need to learn to make more productivity for Plotter Mechanics on the print production side?

44:51 - Joed De La Cruz
  On the print side, yeah, it would be super beneficial because I think out of Adobe, you could have so much.  Creativity and design stuff, like original things, so I think it would be very beneficial.

45:08 - Chris Andrade
  What tool of Adobe do you think you need to start honing in on? Because you know there's thousands, right?

45:16 - Joed De La Cruz
  Yeah.

45:16 - Chris Andrade
  Which one in particular would be beneficial for you guys?

45:23 - Joed De La Cruz
  Well, I'd say Illustrator and Photoshop.

45:28 - Chris Andrade
  Is there a particular tool inside them, inside Illustrator that's focused on Illustrator that you would like to learn more about?  Like for me, how long it takes for me to take a drawing and then do an image trace and then clean it up, vectorize it, scale it out, right?  Right. if I can just study how to create drawings or like pictures and to actually turn them into vectored.  just answer and of ASC. It say doing not but been but I'm That for me would be beneficial if I can just have a full SOP to do that one process.  Is there something like that that you would find beneficial?

46:13 - Joed De La Cruz
  Yeah, I would say just a little bit related to that, more image enhancing because I think image is a simple process, but just image enhancing.  Okay, cool. Thank you.

46:25 - Chris Andrade
  And is there any illustrator? I'm sorry, are you using ChatGPT, Quad, Gemini? Are you using any of the AI languages at all?

46:37 - Joed De La Cruz
  ChatGPT, but just for like daily use, just random things. Sometimes I'll ask for it to image enhance something that's, it doesn't look too bad, but it could be a little better.  And I'll just use it for that or just basic questions that I have for like illustrator that I don't know that, like shortcuts and stuff that are beneficial.  Yep, yep, yep. Do you find that useful?

47:02 - Chris Andrade
  Yeah, very. Awesome. How does the image generation, like you're using ChatGBT to help enhance that, how much time does that save you doing that?  Oh, it saves me a bunch of time.

47:16 - Joed De La Cruz
  I could just tell it to do something. It doesn't come out good all the time, but I'd say like 8 times out of 10, 9 times out of 10, it's good.  It'll give me a result like in 5 minutes, 3 minutes.

47:27 - Chris Andrade
  So are you finding yourself using the same prompt over and over and over again to generate the same rendering, if you will?

47:40 - Joed De La Cruz
  Kind of. So sometimes I'll have to specify, like make it PNG or enhance this, because sometimes it'll change the image on you and give you something completely different.

47:51 - Chris Andrade
  So yeah, so if you had whatever the requirements of the output is what dictates the prompt. Got it. Thank you.  Yep.

48:02 - Joed De La Cruz
  Okay.

48:03 - Mekaiel Abdullahi
  So, Kelsey mentioned you handled the Apache rental job solo. So, walk me through what type of jobs you handle.  know you said you're more familiar with HPs. Take me through what kind of jobs you're comfortable with versus what type of jobs you're not comfortable with.

48:22 - Joed De La Cruz
  I would say just general service or maintenance calls, which are more like from the exterior, I would say. Nothing like having to go in and change parts.  I'm not comfortable with it, but there's some things or some parts of the printer that I'd rather just, it's just a longer process, I'd say.

48:49 - Chris Andrade
  So, can you, can you tell me why, what parts though, quick? Like what parts particularly?

48:56 - Joed De La Cruz
  There's more margin for error in them and like changing. So say a carriage or, or changing, uh, encoder strip.  Actually, no, I'm okay with that. here, let me ask you this, right? Oh, the one I would say like, for sure.  It's like the ink tubes. Those are, I don't know. I don't know about that yet. Okay. Let me ask you this.

49:21 - Mekaiel Abdullahi
  I like, you know, when you're in jobber and you see your request come in, like what type of jobs do you like when you see the request, what type of jobs do you say?  Oh, I'm excited to go do that one. I can do this one. Um, what type of jobs are they?  And then what type of jobs are the more, I know you said they're the more intricate ones or more technical.  Um, but can you give me like an example from, um, like what type of jobs they are?

49:48 - Joed De La Cruz
  I would say, like, if there's a, like a cartridge problem or, or a print head issue where we gotta replace a print head.  Or just, um, So quality problem, those are usually like, like, I'm pretty confident in them, like I'm looking forward to them.  And oddly enough, I'd say like, the encoder strip and the belt. I like to do that because I'm pretty confident in it now.  And I like the process of it. It's pretty simple. And, and yeah, nice.

50:24 - Mekaiel Abdullahi
  Now give me like maybe a few that you're not so comfortable with.

50:32 - Joed De La Cruz
  I say the ones that have to do with a lot of ink. So anything that has to do with like the ink tubes or the, those assemblies, um, like on the age on a page wide that we have here, we did a couple of them.  It takes, it takes mostly like a two, it's like a two person job. Um, but it's, uh, I forgot.  It's like a maintenance kit too. It's called, um, is, was, it's. How did you know it was a two-person job?

51:02 - Chris Andrade
  What told you that? Or did you just guess? Or how did you know it was a two-person job? Well, I did it initially with Kelsey.

51:09 - Joed De La Cruz
  I did it a couple times, I think. Well, we were both there, but there's this thing in the process where you have to lift it with your hands, like from the inside, like really, really hard, as much as you got.  And someone on the other side has to lock it because those printers are heavy. So I don't think there's no way to do that with just one person.  Got it.

51:32 - Mekaiel Abdullahi
  Got it. So ink, and what else? Ink tubes, assemblies.

51:41 - Joed De La Cruz
  On the larger format ones, like that are not HP, usually like the print head stuff, I don't, I don't really like, I'm not comfortable with it yet.  And like, sometimes the image quality things on the larger format because It's a completely different process, and I'm usually not familiar with the whole interface of those printers.

52:08 - Mekaiel Abdullahi
  And I get it, man. I've been a tech for a while, and like, you know, you're on a job sometime, and you're like, you get stuck, and you're like, oh, oh, crap.  So like, that process is different for everyone. So like, for you, I'm sure there's probably a moment in working with Kelsey where you probably went to a job, and you showed up, and you had to tackle it, and you're like, oh, snap.  Like, I'm stuck. Like, what happens from there? It happened to me once.

52:37 - Joed De La Cruz
  One of my first service calls alone, I think. And we got like a bad Google review or something because I got the service manual, which is funny.  But what my process is, when I'm stuck, I usually pull out the service manual. I like to study the whole process beforehand so I can actually go in there and do it.  it. it. If I'm stuck, usually pull that up, or my last resort would usually just call Elsie. So real quick, your study process, you said you liked to study beforehand.

53:11 - Chris Andrade
  Walk me through that. What does your study process look like?

53:14 - Joed De La Cruz
  Usually in the office, well, when it's something that, like replacing a part, it's usually in the service manual, like it'll tell you step by step.  And when it's something troubleshooting, I just like to look at anything related to it in the service manual and kind of like lock in my head like what the process is or what test to do to come to a conclusion.  And I usually like to just like note the page down of the service manual so I can get to it fast if I need it.  Do ever find taking pictures? I don't think so. I think I don't, I haven't. Let me just say, just based off that answer, I know you're a really good tech man, for sure, 100%.  Appreciate it. you.

54:00 - Mekaiel Abdullahi
  That's awesome, man. How often, just on average, I know you're more comfortable in your role now, but how often do you say you do call out for help?  Or when you do get stuck, how often does that happen? Just trying to get an idea, you know?

54:16 - Joed De La Cruz
  Well, there's two. There's some times where I know I'm a little stuck somewhere, but I have an idea of how to get to it.  And then there's the other, which I don't really call nobody, I just figure it out. But there's the other one where I have no idea what's going on, and that's mostly like...  Those are the longer calls, right? Yeah, I usually call someone else.

54:39 - Mekaiel Abdullahi
  On average, let's just say per month, how many times do you think you get those little calls where it's probably like you're 80% there and you just need to be pointed to that last 10 or 20% versus the longer, oh , I have no idea ones.  On average, per month. I'm just trying to get an idea. Um...

55:00 - Joed De La Cruz
  So the ones where I just need like, like a little redirection, I'd say it's, I'll put it like as a percentage of service causes like 10%, 15%.  And then the other ones where I don't have no idea, I'd say it's more like 20% sometimes. Okay.

55:21 - Chris Andrade
  How do you quantify that, man, Joe, that you just, again, you're, you're showing us how badass you are. I'm just saying, like, I'm just impressed, man.  Good job. Nice.

55:32 - Mekaiel Abdullahi
  So the goal would be the next section is kind of like going over how you learn the processes and for the jobs.  So just going to touch on that. How do you learn the jobs? You mentioned you read the service manuals and the processes and familiarize yourself with the equipment that you're going to go on jobs.  Walk me through how Kelsey trains you on a repair..anner. Cool. Okay. Yeah.

56:00 - Joed De La Cruz
  Well, when Kelsey trains me, it's usually, well, beforehand, it would be like, I'll go with him, and he'll show me, he'll explain this, how this works, this is how this happens.  And, and sometimes he'll have me like, you know, go ahead and try it, take this part out, like, you know, go through the process.  Or sometimes he'll disassemble the part or replace the part. And then he'll have me assemble it. So I just kind of do the same thing.  But, you know, it's hands on stuff, right?

56:24 - Mekaiel Abdullahi
  So do you think, do you think it'd be valuable to say, instead of, Do you, what do you find more valuable?  Like, Kelsey showing you there in person, getting hands on? Or maybe you watching your video and seeing, seeing that process?

56:41 - Joed De La Cruz
  I think watching a video, slightly more, more, more better for me, because I'm able to just like, And then take it in on your own time.  Yeah, exactly. Kelsey's more, more fast paced thing. it's just, you gotta catch up. Yeah, that's what my question is.

56:56 - Chris Andrade
  And I'm gonna have to sidetrack, but this is like, vital information. Because you're the only one who knows it.  During service calls, and you're with Kelsey, and service calls, how often does his phone ring? And then how often does his phone ring cause him to deviate from the plan?  And then how long does that deviation cost in time lost?

57:17 - Joed De La Cruz
  Well, I would say the deviation, whether it be phone calls or not, it happens like 80% of the time.  And then for him to get back on track, it takes usually like at least like five minutes, three to five minutes.

57:34 - Chris Andrade
  Is there a way that you would think like, man, if only we can do this, and it would solve it with that part component to it?  Because I know, I can only imagine, I can only imagine.

57:45 - Joed De La Cruz
  I would say, mostly, like distractions, like text messages, phone calls, things that could be taken care of by someone else, or be answered by someone else.  Because I think, Kelsey. Likes to pick up, like, the phone calls of new customers and stuff, but if someone, like, if Alyssa could, like, be trained well enough to handle that, and Kelsey be confident in her to handle that, then that'd solve a lot of that.  Thank you for that.

58:16 - Chris Andrade
  Hey, yeah. So go ahead, Mikael. Thank you.

58:20 - Mekaiel Abdullahi
  So in hours per week, how many hours do you think Kelsey spends showing you how to do things, reviewing your work, or helping you on jobs?

58:35 - Joed De La Cruz
  Um, not so much now. I would say in the beginning, would say. Oh, the beginning?

58:40 - Mekaiel Abdullahi
  you're trying to get is an understanding of how much time and effort it requires to transfer Kelsey's knowledge almost.  Do you know what I mean? Okay, okay.

58:50 - Joed De La Cruz
  Um, it took me, like, a good three months, I'd say. Um, on average, in those first. Three months per week.

59:01 - Mekaiel Abdullahi
  much time do you think Kelsey is spending with you in hours? Like training?

59:05 - Joed De La Cruz
  in hours. Yeah. Like per week on average, right? Like 20, 30 hours, 20, 30 hours initially. And then it probably averaged out somewhere, right?

59:16 - Mekaiel Abdullahi
  Yeah. So that about 70% of the time.

59:20 - Chris Andrade
  Yeah.

59:20 - Joed De La Cruz
  About. Yeah. And then now what do you think it is?

59:26 - Mekaiel Abdullahi
  Less than 10%.

59:27 - Joed De La Cruz
  Got it. Good job. Good job.

59:30 - Chris Andrade
  Thanks. Yeah.

59:33 - Mekaiel Abdullahi
  If you had a library, video library of showing you Kelsey doing like common repairs and diagnostics and customer interactions, would you use it and would it be helpful?

59:45 - Joed De La Cruz
  Yeah, definitely. I think so because it'll show me the way he takes care of the service calls or takes care of the service calls.  And maybe there's something I miss or don't do or don't focus on that soon. think that... This Yeah. It's important that he does.

1:00:01 - Chris Andrade
  Can I ask you another question on that then, Joe? Yeah. Because of how hard it is to create the video aspect.  If there was an easier solution for water mechanics to create like a flowchart and have yes or nos and, you know, obviously take the manual and create a flowchart for you.  And then eventually we can build off of that. But would that flowchart help you not only diagnose but recreate or whatever have you?

1:00:43 - Joed De La Cruz
  Yeah.

1:00:45 - Chris Andrade
  Just like maybe like walk out your service and then you're like, yes or no, I got to this point, yes or no, okay, I can go here.  I mean, and then have something help block out your.

1:00:59 - Joed De La Cruz
  Yeah. Yeah, that would be great, something I think that would be really handy because that's usually the process I take, like internally, like I'll go this or this and then out of that I'll make a yes or no and then I'll go to the next step.  That's my process of troubleshooting pretty much. Nice.

1:01:19 - Mekaiel Abdullahi
  So getting back to common repairs, diagnostics, and customer interactions, what would you say are your three to five top repair procedures that if you had that video library or that resource to look or use, what would those three to five processes be?  Like just off the top of your head. It'd just be more for, like, parts replacement.

1:01:48 - Joed De La Cruz
  Like the technical stuff, right? Yes.

1:01:51 - Mekaiel Abdullahi
  The three to five most technically challenging repairs or common repairs things, right? Yeah. And the steps after that, too.

1:01:59 - Joed De La Cruz
  Got it.

1:02:02 - Mekaiel Abdullahi
  If a new tech started tomorrow, what would you have them learn first?

1:02:11 - Joed De La Cruz
  The service, just like basic exterior service, especially with the HP, I think it's more user friendly. And just more, you'll be able to understand it way easier than the other ones.  How many HP calls versus the other calls do you think there are? Sorry. Out of 10 calls, I'd say 7 or 8 are HP usually.  Okay, perfect. Thank you. Great.

1:02:41 - Mekaiel Abdullahi
  And then just taking a broader step in that same question of what would you tell a new tech to learn tomorrow?  What would make this job easier for that new tech? So if someone came in today and they're like, hey, like, how do I be successful in this job?  What would you kind of tell them or advise them on? Like, things to learn, or do, or processes. What would make them successful in their job?

1:03:06 - Joed De La Cruz
  I'd say just pretty much get to know the printer, because in general, the printers work very similar to each other.  But mostly, again, with HP, it's just more user-friendly, and everything is more automated. So even if, like, in my case, I would open the cover, I'd tell the printer to clean itself or make a process or something, and then I'll visually, like, I have a visual of it doing it automatically, and I could transfer that to, like, other printers and stuff that don't do it automatically, and I could do it myself.  Very nice.

1:03:47 - Chris Andrade
  Cool.

1:03:48 - Mekaiel Abdullahi
  That's super helpful.

1:03:49 - Joed De La Cruz
  Anything else on that? If there was a new tech, I'd just, we have a whole bunch of printers back here, so I'd walk them through that.  Through the whole process and the interface and the important things to look for, pretty much. How long do you think that would take?  Probably a day's worth of work. Eight hours?

1:04:14 - Chris Andrade
  About, yeah.

1:04:16 - Mekaiel Abdullahi
  Okay, so now we're going to move on to like equipment and pre-job information. Before you go on a job, what information do you wish you had about the customer's equipment?

1:04:37 - Joed De La Cruz
  Well, first of all, like what cutter or printer they have and then if they have anything other than those printers or cutters and the software that they use and what they do.  Is that not in Jobber currently? Sometimes they'll have like one printer when in reality they have like four or five.  bad, these to of We're It's That's okay. We That you need to troubleshoot and fix?

1:05:01 - Mekaiel Abdullahi
  So the Jobber request is one printer, but in reality it's like four printers?

1:05:07 - Joed De La Cruz
  Well, the one I'm a service, sometimes it's there as the main printer, sometimes it's not. It's named as another printer and then when I get to the spot, there's a different printer.  How often does that happen? Sorry. Not so often because, so like on the description of Jobber, they'll usually have one printer or plotter.  And then on the description of the job, they have the actual details of the job. Well, they do a good job with that, but sometimes I think it'd still be helpful to know what they work with.

1:05:47 - Chris Andrade
  The ability to edit the job, the client's information while you're there to update there while you're there and you notice, oh, there's three more printers.  don't tymor I can just take a picture of the serial number, add it to Jobber real quick. Do you have that ability?  I could at least add it to the notes, at least as a reference. So you can take a picture of the printer and the serial number, the plate, and then that's all you would need.  Is there any other documentation? Or maybe you can take a picture of like, isn't there a status report that the printers have to show how many miles it's printed?

1:06:34 - Joed De La Cruz
  Yeah, I think that's really helpful actually to have a reference to that, especially with the print heads, which is the things that are more commonly serviced.  And the most expensive. Yeah.

1:06:48 - Mekaiel Abdullahi
  And on those, do you, so like if, say like the service history of like that client or customer, is that all?  But in Jobber as well? Or where do you look up that information?

1:07:02 - Joed De La Cruz
  No, the client history is never on Jobber. It'd just be more by Alyssa, asking Alyssa or asking the customer.  Okay.

1:07:13 - Mekaiel Abdullahi
  And Alyssa's kind of responsible for feeding you that information, right? And all the information that comes in the Jobber and stuff?  Yeah.

1:07:20 - Joed De La Cruz
  If we don't take the calls with the customer personally, then it'd mostly be Alyssa. Got it. And do you?

1:07:27 - Mekaiel Abdullahi
  That's a good question. Walking through, like, you dealing with clients directly, does that ever happen?

1:07:36 - Joed De La Cruz
  Yeah, it's happened a couple of times. Most of the time it's with Kelsey, like, he'll handle it. But if I have to make a call with them, I usually like to get the basic information of, if it's a new client, like, get their company name, their email, phone number, and address and all.  And then ask what cutter they have or printer and what their issue is and just kind of get over.

1:08:00 - Mekaiel Abdullahi
  Is that usually a phone call? Yeah. And where do you put that, you're putting that information into Jobber? On Jobber, if it's a new client, we add it on their new client.

1:08:09 - Joed De La Cruz
  If it's an existing client, we just add it as a job or estimate to follow up with.

1:08:17 - Mekaiel Abdullahi
  And everything related to the service requests is in Jobber, so like what kind of machine you're working on is all in the notes and stuff, right?

1:08:23 - Joed De La Cruz
  Yeah.

1:08:23 - Mekaiel Abdullahi
  And then is there anything ever, like say you get a ticket that you have to ask Kelsey for, like follow up details or anything that's missing from that request?

1:08:36 - Joed De La Cruz
  Actually, yeah. Sometimes like Kelsey will take a call, but there's not much detail. He gives me like the overview of maybe it's this or maybe like just take care of this, but I'm not too sure of what caused it or what was the whole process leading up to it.  Got it.

1:08:52 - Mekaiel Abdullahi
  And does that information when he takes the call get reflected into Jobber? no, right? So it doesn't go into Jobber right now?  No, no. Right now.

1:09:01 - Joed De La Cruz
  But what's been a little helpful sometimes it's him like the recording the calls, which we can actually get an insider.

1:09:11 - Chris Andrade
  Do you have a way to record your entries at the service instead of having to type and dictate? Can you just record your findings, your report in job work?  Yes.

1:09:27 - Joed De La Cruz
  Kelsey has us add a note and, you know, make either, you know, a description of what we did and all and with pictures.

1:09:36 - Mekaiel Abdullahi
  Nice.

1:09:36 - Chris Andrade
  So are you writing this down or are you recording it or typing it?

1:09:41 - Joed De La Cruz
  Well, I'm just like dictating it to the microphone. Oh, gotcha.

1:09:45 - Chris Andrade
  So you're dictating it and then you're seeing it type out. Got it. Yeah.

1:09:52 - Mekaiel Abdullahi
  Okay. I promise we're almost done. No reason. Okay. So when you're in the field and you need to look something up.  How do you do that today?

1:10:04 - Joed De La Cruz
  Right now, it's usually called Lyssa, or I have remote access to my desktop from my phone. So I just enter in there remotely and then just save the service.  What type of stuff are you looking at? Procedures, part numbers?

1:10:20 - Mekaiel Abdullahi
  What kind of stuff are you most of looking up?

1:10:22 - Joed De La Cruz
  Procedures from there. With part numbers, I usually like to just take a picture of it, add it to the notes, and look it up later when I come back to the office.  Got it.

1:10:32 - Mekaiel Abdullahi
  And if you had like a tool on your phone, like say ChatGBT or something, that you can ask a question like, hey, what equipment does ABC Graphic have or whatever?  What do you have on HP 730 printed? Would you use it?

1:10:44 - Joed De La Cruz
  Yeah, I think so.

1:10:47 - Mekaiel Abdullahi
  What are the top three questions you want to ask that tool? So I'm assuming like procedures on specific like printers or plotters, right?  And what else? And more troubleshooting questions?

1:11:04 - Joed De La Cruz
  Troubleshooting steps and questions? Yeah. What else? And the steps after, after replacing a part because sometimes it'll be like in a service mode or something like that.  Got it.

1:11:20 - Mekaiel Abdullahi
  Nice. What kind of, what would help you get ready for more calls, like independently faster?

1:11:30 - Joed De La Cruz
  I think that having, having a resource to go to where I could follow the troubleshooting issues or, or the steps before and after servicing the printer or cutter.  Got it.

1:11:44 - Mekaiel Abdullahi
  And are there any specific machines or types of skills you want to learn next?

1:11:53 - Joed De La Cruz
  Spills, I would say designing more, more for the printing side. Yeah. With Illustrator, right?

1:12:02 - Chris Andrade
  Yeah, both with Illustrator, but also with Flexi.

1:12:06 - Joed De La Cruz
  Oh, you haven't mentioned that. What's that? What's Flexi? Flexi is basically the design program we use. It's like a two-part.  One, we designed it, and the other one, we send the print files and all that, but they're under the same brand.  Got it. And they incorporate better. Oh, thank you.

1:12:29 - Mekaiel Abdullahi
  Nice. Joed, kind of like final wrap-up thoughts and questions. Is this your role changing as the business grows?

1:12:39 - Joed De La Cruz
  I'm not too sure. I've thought about it a little bit, maybe training other people, passing it down to knowledge, and actually, yes, the printing side.  I'm very big on our printing side. I think there's a lot of opportunity there, too. Cool. week.

1:12:58 - Mekaiel Abdullahi
  Very nice. Yeah, man. there. And I can actually, like, it's I Thank

1:13:00 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
  Designing like, would you, so those designs get printed on physical things mostly, right? But do you ever think about doing digital design as well, like for websites?

1:13:14 - Joed De La Cruz
  No, not as of now. Got it.

1:13:22 - Mekaiel Abdullahi
  Sorry to interrupt you, Mikael.

1:13:24 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
  No worries, no worries at all.

1:13:30 - Chris Andrade
  Yeah, go ahead, Matt. So you dealt with Shopify like a little bit.

1:13:36 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
  Do you ever, is there, what else do you do in your job for Shopify other than kind of like taking an order from there and then like, do you do anything else?  Or what do you do with Shopify if you ever interact with Shopify? Cause we're, we're still, we still don't really understand how that component really ties into plotter mechanics.

1:13:58 - Joed De La Cruz
  Right. Right. Um, Um, Thank Not really. haven't had time to mess with it that much. But it seems interesting because it ties in with the website of Platter Mechanics.  But as of now, I've just only been like looking at orders and the updates and transferring it to Jabra.  Okay. Sounds good.

1:14:19 - Chris Andrade
  And my question to you, sir, is it's very well aware that you are customer service driven, which I, by the way, am obsessed with.  During your time and really putting your customer service hat on, on these service calls, when you're providing your skills, right?  And you're on these calls with these clients and these customers, and you see these instances that can be potentially an upsell opportunity.  And you're like, dang it. If we only had this. Can you give me some ideas of what upsell opportunities Plotter Mechanics is losing every single day?  Printing.

1:15:08 - Joed De La Cruz
  And I say that because I don't know, I've been wanting to talk to Kelsey about it, but I don't know where he stands on having it service, supplies, and sales, and then printing, being part of Plotter Mechanics or not.  But it's because there's been some service calls where you go to, and then they'll be like, oh, do you guys print too?  Can you guys print out labels and stuff? And he'll be like, sometimes he'll say, yeah, we have all that equipment at the office.  Sometimes he'll be like, no, we're strictly just like a sales and service. And why do you think that is?  Why do you think he says that? Well, recently, I've come to find out that it's because some people will get mad because of competition.  I'll Friends. But sometimes it doesn't make sense because they won't have nothing to do with printing because we service like a lot of like print shops and stuff, but sometimes there'll be like tint shops or like just like offices that do CAD drawings and they're asking for that and then he'll like deny it or like just brush it off, which I think is like a really, really big opportunity to make a lot.  Yeah. Thank you for pointing that out.

1:16:24 - Chris Andrade
  Other than that, is there any other opportunities you see that can be capitalized on pretty efficiently?

1:16:31 - Joed De La Cruz
  Yeah. Inks and supplies, which it's, it's already like moving, but I think it could be, you know, something, something pretty big.

1:16:38 - Chris Andrade
  Have you got any insight to the current plans for the inventory?

1:16:45 - Joed De La Cruz
  No. Okay. No worries.

1:16:48 - Chris Andrade
  Awesome. I pretty much, man, I think we, dude, we got more than we bargained for. So I can't thank you more.  I mean, this is just phenomenal. Cool. I'm glad.

1:16:59 - Joed De La Cruz
  Yep. Yep. Michael, anything else you want to add?

1:17:05 - Mekaiel Abdullahi
  I think we did cover most of it. Yeah, I think I'm good. Do you have anything, Matthew?

1:17:14 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
  I'm not sure if we covered it, but there was one question in the beginning around like if the CAD file didn't match the right size or something, you said it took a long time to get to finish the job that you were doing.  So I was wondering like if we can get a number on like how long would it take if the file doesn't match up or like what's the cause behind taking a lot longer?

1:17:41 - Joed De La Cruz
  Usually it takes like a good, it's taking me like 20 minutes. Sometimes it's taking me up to three hours because with bigger plans or sets that have like 100 plus pages, I have to go in there, find like the ones that are good.  . . . . So maybe save paper or either like just do the whole job once again, like the whole thing again, and sometimes just like match up the pages, make sure they're all in order.  Sometimes they'll be flipped, sometimes they'll be cut off, and I just have to like do one by one basically.  Got it.

1:18:20 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
  So like the larger, if there's a large number of pages that takes longer, of course. Yeah.

1:18:26 - Joed De La Cruz
  Well, it depends how many pages are messed up, pretty much. Yeah, I know exactly what you're talking about.

1:18:33 - Chris Andrade
  And it is very frustrating. And I think there is, I think, because the prices that Kelsey's charging, I think there's, he's really not, I don't know how low he is in the industry standard, but he's charging $1.50 or $1.75 a page, FedEx is charging me $4.75, right?  Yeah. And I'm like, okay, so I I'm just wondering, how many times does that happen where we can charge an extra amount for, okay, it's been over 30 minutes, we have to charge an extra $20 setup fee or whatever it takes to pay for that time.  I just don't know how that will look.

1:19:19 - Joed De La Cruz
  Well, I think it'd be more like the printer, like consumables, because like ink and print heads, and there's like maintenance kit, and then there's the maintenance kit too, and all that.  I think it consumes a lot, and I don't think he takes that into the pricing. I'm not too sure.  Good point. I mean, he has his paper here, but I don't know. Right, he's still adding up. Right, right.  Okay, thank you for that. Yeah. At what point in the process do you get the files?

1:19:54 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
  Like, so, do you know if like, has it been paid for? for yet by the time you get the files?

1:20:03 - Joed De La Cruz
  No, it's usually not paid for yet, but I still like to do it because, I mean, they're gonna get paid for, especially with the company that we work for, like, a lot.

1:20:17 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
  Yeah, got it. Yeah, I usually leave it up to Alyssa to take care of that.

1:20:23 - Joed De La Cruz
  Okay, cool.

1:20:24 - Mekaiel Abdullahi
  I think that ties into the rating system that they had with their customers. I think Nikki mentioned it. But yeah, I don't think there's anything else.  Just to follow up on the training videos, you mentioned the three to five most valuable things to get recorded would be the three to five procedures or diagnostics, right?  And what to do after that, right?

1:20:55 - Joed De La Cruz
  On those types of files, right? Yeah. Yeah. Okay.

1:20:59 - Mekaiel Abdullahi
  I mean, that's it for me. Thank And Joed, you're a rockstar, bro. I can't wait. You seem like the person, like, we're going to need your feedback.  Actually, yeah, the last kind of question I wanted to ask is kind of like, what kind of, what do you need from us to be able to, like, make the testing of these tools and things easier for you and your team?  The testing of the tools?

1:21:21 - Joed De La Cruz
  Yeah.

1:21:22 - Mekaiel Abdullahi
  So, like, the systems that we eventually move in and put into place and the processes that we do change, what kind of help do you need from us to make your life easier?

1:21:36 - Joed De La Cruz
  Well, I would just say when those tools do get implemented, just, like, the most efficient and beneficial things we could get out of it, pretty much, on a day-to-day basis.  And, I mean, other than that, that's it. I'd say. So, like, kind of how to use it the most effectively?  Yeah, exactly. Yeah. Yeah.

1:22:00 - Mekaiel Abdullahi
  I mean, that's it for me, man. Like I said, bro, you're a rock star, man. Yeah. Appreciate it. Clearly.

1:22:06 - Chris Andrade
  Clearly, man. Clearly. Thank you, guys. Appreciate it.

1:22:10 - Joed De La Cruz
  Matthew, got anything?

1:22:12 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
  No, just thank you so much for all the detail, information, and just, you know, being so on top of everything.  So, it's amazing. Thank you. Cool. Sounds good.

1:22:23 - Joed De La Cruz
  That's it, brother.

1:22:24 - Chris Andrade
  We'll talk to you soon. I'll be in there to bring you that camera and bring you that microphone. We got to get you set up, dog.  got you.

1:22:31 - Joed De La Cruz
  All right. Sounds good, brother. All right. see you. Thanks, man. See you guys.

1:22:42 - Chris Andrade
  Pick a sour. Dude, we got so much gold out of that, though. We did. Dude, I went into doctor mode.  I was clinical, trying to diagnose this cancer. Dude. Yeah, you had a lot of good.

1:22:59 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
  Yeah, Just technical knowledge and just where to ask more questions that I wouldn't have known, Chris.

1:23:06 - Chris Andrade
  Dude, you don't understand how difficult the architectural side of the plans are, especially not for engineers. It's a whole other level.  But for contractors, it's a whole other level. And he is so right about the missed opportunities that they got on the printing.  I'm so happy to hear him validating that because, dude, it's easy money. It's just they don't have the systems to replicate that office to do it.

1:23:39 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
  Yeah, I think he's going to end up probably like training people once we roll up. know 100%, bro.

1:23:47 - Chris Andrade
  He is way more advanced than I thought. I'll just say that. Yeah. I knew he was good. But damn, he's good.  He is good. Yeah.

1:23:59 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
  good. of the back Yeah, got to pull in this context.

1:24:02 - Mekaiel Abdullahi
  This is really good. Yeah, this just changed our whole proposal now, right?

1:24:10 - Chris Andrade
  It was a good insight, like really good insight.

1:24:14 - Mekaiel Abdullahi
  Yeah.

1:24:16 - Chris Andrade
  Did you guys hear about the knowledge base yet again? I really feel like that is our ticket. So it's our core.

1:24:26 - Mekaiel Abdullahi
  What we identified with Jo is kind of what we already knew. Phase one training is going to be important, like the SOPs that we roll out.  That's going to be important, as well as more importantly, the training aspect. And it reminds me of what Nikki was saying in the beginning of when we did Approacher, of how important the process and documentation and the training.  Ideally for phase two, like maybe the core three to five most procedural things that he deals with, or that he finds the most difficult.  So the training's big, almost as big as for me. The inventory slash equipment management solution. And both those things are both like medium sized, I would say, and in challenge because they both require multiple things.  And then just afterthoughts. I think, yeah, Joed, Joed's on point is if he gets the like from a tech technician standpoint, if he understands the procedure of like the different kind of machines on the common follow ups and the common pre pre troubleshooting steps, and and if he has somewhere to go and ask and prompt like and get that last 10% from when he stuck on his service calls.  And maybe even material for the ones that he's not familiar with. He seems on point like he's high speed, like to me, you know.

1:25:44 - Chris Andrade
  So the reason why I asked him about that question about him setting up for Kelsey, because Kelsey told me that he's like, man, if I can figure out how we can set up where Joe comes gets the printer all ready to go.  So we're all. All I got to do is show up. He was like, pickled by that idea. That's why I kind of enhanced on that question a little bit, because Kelsey seemed interested on a way where these big jobs were like that two person job that he was saying, if there's a way for us to identify that that job is going to be a two person job, well, Joe can go there for an hour, get to that point, then Kelsey can time that hour to show up where he just shows, wipes in, helps him lift it out.  Done, done, and move on to the next one.

1:26:33 - Mekaiel Abdullahi
  So just to, and then also another thing I thought of is three main concerns is the training, right? I think the training, right?  And then the process is like the coordination in the morning, especially some of the CAD prints he does and the planning of the day.  think phase one is going to alleviate some of that, but as well, like there might still be some gaps in phase two that we should address.  But yeah, I think. I think it was all good stuff. And it also ties into like the RAG agent that we were thinking of and the knowledge base that we're trying to...  Can you guys tell me what a RAG agent is?

1:27:09 - Chris Andrade
  I keep hearing this. I just haven't. What is a RAG agent? RAG agent.

1:27:14 - Mekaiel Abdullahi
  RAG stands for Retrieve, Augment, and Generate. And it's like a process that the LLM does, like the knowledge base.

1:27:21 - Chris Andrade
  So it's a specified knowledge base.

1:27:24 - Mekaiel Abdullahi
  So it's like an LLM that's trained on your knowledge base. RAG It's been on my board to research that up.

1:27:30 - Chris Andrade
  Thank you.

1:27:35 - Mekaiel Abdullahi
  So, yeah, I think pretty overall, we did validate a lot of things and we also discovered a lot of new things.
  ACTION ITEM: Create interview feedback page; send link to Joed; notify Chris + Mekaiel when ready - WATCH: https://fathom.video/share/dxKy89jNjTXytKHC68ioAzsmgyNCQKeH?timestamp=5262.9999  It's perfect timing, I guess. Yeah, I'm glad we got that out of the way.

1:27:49 - Chris Andrade
  Like, holy  did we make today. We got a lot of  done.

1:27:53 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
  Do you guys think about, like, getting feedback for us? Like for our audit process. Cause I've been, I thought about that and I'm putting together, I'm seeing if I can put together like a form.  That's just like, that we can send to someone right after the interview with us. Just like, Hey, do you have any feedback for the whole process?  Like, what did you think? I love that dude.

1:28:19 - Chris Andrade
  Yeah. Let's send that to Joe. Okay.

1:28:23 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
  Yeah. I'm going to try and add it as a page.

1:28:26 - Chris Andrade
  That's such a good idea. Yeah.

1:28:29 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
  Cause like, I remember that was when I first interviewed at Amazon or like part was part of an interview or whatever.  They, they'd like, they asked the candidate, like, what did you think of our process? And I was like, wow, like that just shows that you're just like always improving, you know?

1:28:47 - Chris Andrade
  Yeah, I agree. I do love that, Matt. That is such a good point. Okay.

1:28:53 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
  All right. I'll let you guys know when it's ready, but anything else that we should cover for the Joe?  Yeah. Just recap or like any thoughts, I guess, anymore. I thought it was awesome. I thought you guys did a good job.  I was kind of like you get the flow, right?

1:29:13 - Mekaiel Abdullahi
  Like as long as we get like good questions, it kind of figures out the flow for you. I was literally just reading the questions and thinking through like his answers, you know, I honestly like me.

1:29:24 - Chris Andrade
  That was our best flow yet.

1:29:25 - Mekaiel Abdullahi
  Yeah, we coordinate on those questions, like ideally, like, honestly, the way I want to go with these interviews is just one on ones.  It's going to be way more efficient. And maybe two on ones for now. That's not kind of true, because you would have known the questions to kind of like, there has to be a dual.  I feel like there's going to be industries that we don't know about. And we're going to have to rely on the LLM to, you know, kind of feed us that context or us ask better questions, you know?

1:29:55 - Chris Andrade
  Once we have the five-star framework better, Bill, it would do with us, right?

1:30:00 - Mekaiel Abdullahi
  It's like, say you weren't here, Chris, I probably would have asked Joed a lot of non-industry questions. I don't know the industry at all.  So I wouldn't have moved on to another question unless I understood completely until he could explain to me in his own words what the kind of process is.  And when building automations, I think that's kind of important too. Having inside knowledge is good. It's definitely useful, but also not having it is going to be ideal.

1:30:26 - Chris Andrade
  Well, I just, the reason why I stepped in is because there was a couple moments where you moved on, but there wasn't, there was points that I knew was missing.  That's why I kind of like jumped in there.

1:30:37 - Mekaiel Abdullahi
  Yeah, no, I'm saying that was, that was good stuff, but I'm just saying in general, you know, ask the questions that we don't understand about the industry, you know?

1:30:48 - Chris Andrade
  Yep. Yep. I get what you're saying. It makes so much more sense because it's going to come to that point.  Because if we don't understand, we can't. Right, right, right.

1:30:57 - Mekaiel Abdullahi
  Like we're lucky we have you for this one because you understand the industry. Yeah, I get exactly what you're saying.

1:31:06 - Chris Andrade
  I get exactly what you're saying. Easy. I think we're a wrap, boys. Anything else? Yeah. I'm eat some food, man.  I walked three miles during that. Three and a half, actually. that's nice. I'm gonna make it up and hit the gym.  I appreciate you guys letting me do that. Thank you so much. No worries. I appreciate you guys, too.

1:31:25 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
  I was time masking. I just made, like, breakfast and I ate some food and I got coffee. So...

1:31:30 - Chris Andrade
  Nice.

1:31:31 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
  listening, but I just had a few inputs there and you guys handled it, so thank you.

1:31:36 - Chris Andrade
  Yep. Teamwork dreams to dream. We'll talk to you guys later. Easy. Bye, guys. All right. Bye. See you guys.
