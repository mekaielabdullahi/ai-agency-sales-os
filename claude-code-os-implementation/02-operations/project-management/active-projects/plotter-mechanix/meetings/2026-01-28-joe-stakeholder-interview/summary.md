## Critical Issues Identified

### 1. Shopify-to-Jobber Data Mismatch (HIGH PRIORITY)
- **Impact:** 2-3 under-deliveries monthly, each requiring 2-hour fix
- **Root Cause:** Shopify tracks paper by box (2 rolls), Jobber tracks by roll
- **Solution:** Automate conversion with proper unit mapping

### 2. Knowledge Base Gap (HIGH PRIORITY)
- **Impact:** 20-30% of service calls require Kelsey's help
- **Current State:** Reliance on service manuals and calling Kelsey
- **Solution:** Centralized knowledge base with video tutorials and flowcharts

### 3. Training Inefficiency
- **Current:** 20-30 hrs/week of Kelsey's time for 3 months per new tech
- **Preferred:** Self-paced video tutorials for better retention
- **Solution:** Create video library for top technical procedures

### 4. Missed Revenue Opportunity
- **Opportunity:** Print services for non-competitor clients
- **Current Policy:** Declining to avoid upsetting print shop clients
- **Potential:** Significant untapped revenue stream
