## Notes

### Standard Operating Procedures (SOP) Implementation

The main goal is to build clear, documented SOPs that reduce Kelsey's operational burden and improve process consistency at Plotter Mechanics (02:58).

- The team decided to document every task step-by-step to remove reliance on Kelsey's memory and free his time (08:37)
- Matthew explained that SOPs will include both written documents and training videos to onboard new employees smoothly
- Kelsey's goal is to focus on complex repairs while employees handle documented routine tasks
- Initial SOP creation is based on interviews with key team members to map daily roles and processes (06:45)
- This approach aims to eliminate business bottlenecks caused by undocumented workflows and unclear responsibilities

Current SOP adoption challenges stem from Kelsey's inconsistent communication and Alyssa's forgetfulness (30:25)

- Kelsey provides daily instructions variably via voice texts, calls, or emails, often with changing requirements
- Alyssa follows existing processes but often forgets or does not fully understand why she performs tasks
- The SOPs will be paired with daily task checklists and accountability tools to ensure completion and improve adherence (27:21)
- A gamified system will track employee attendance, punctuality, and task completion to provide analytics for reviews and raises

The team plans to use recorded audio from Kelsey's workday to generate SOP content automatically (45:14)

- Kelsey will wear a microphone during work to capture instructions and troubleshooting explanations
- Recordings will be processed to create detailed PDFs and training materials, accelerating SOP development (10:25)
- This reduces manual documentation effort and ensures accuracy by capturing Kelsey's exact methods

### Jobber System Integration and Workflow Automation

Efforts focus on optimizing communication and task management by fully leveraging Jobber and integrating it with automation tools (13:40).

Jobber was implemented as the central software for managing jobs, quotes, and invoicing, replacing multiple prior systems (18:53)

- Alyssa uses Jobber primarily for payment collection and job tracking, but communication between Kelsey and Alyssa remains inefficient
- The team plans to integrate Quo, an AI transcription tool, to record calls and automatically generate Jobber requests (13:40)
- This will provide asynchronous communication, allowing Alyssa to process client updates without real-time calls (15:25)
- Kelsey can leave voicemails transcribed into actionable tasks or proposals, reducing miscommunication and lost information

The planned Quo integration aims to go live by the end of January after thorough testing (50:00)

- Testing is ongoing to avoid disruptions to Plotter Mechanics' live phone system
- This phased approach balances automation benefits with operational stability
- The integration will help trap all client requests systematically and improve traceability (48:27)

The team recognizes that automation will only succeed if underlying SOPs and communication protocols are standardized (17:02)

- Fragmented systems and unclear processes currently undermine automation efforts
- Ensuring consistent use of Jobber's request feature is key to creating a reliable workflow foundation
- Kelsey's inconsistent input style requires building uniform processes before additional tools can be layered on

### Process Accountability and Employee Management

Improving accountability and clarity around responsibilities is essential to reducing errors and operational inefficiencies (27:21).

SOPs will support holding employees accountable through daily task tracking and performance metrics (27:21)

- Employees will follow daily checklists linked to SOPs, monitored via a task app or similar system
- The system will track attendance, punctuality, and task completion, providing Kelsey with actionable analytics
- This data will help inform performance reviews, raises, and corrective actions
- Accountability measures address chronic issues like missed tasks and inconsistent adherence to procedures

Kelsey's management style and communication inconsistencies are major barriers to process stability (31:55)

- Kelsey changes instructions frequently and uses various communication methods inconsistently
- Alyssa struggles to keep up due to unclear instructions and forgetfulness
- The team must enforce more uniform communication methods and task submission via Jobber to reduce confusion (36:14)
- Kelsey's buy-in is critical; the consultant plans to hold him accountable to use the systems consistently

Existing processes created by consultants have reduced headaches by approximately 80-90%, but gaps remain (40:17)

- Monthly checks indicate smoother operations but occasional errors persist due to inconsistent execution
- The team plans to use retrospective analysis to understand why procedures are not followed fully (42:02)
- Interviews and gap analyses will identify root causes of non-compliance and enable targeted fixes

### Communication Strategy and Change Management

Managing expectations and building trust with the client are central to the project's success (22:30).

The team commits to demonstrating ROI within 4 to 6 weeks of implementing each iteration (22:30)

- This timeframe is designed to build client confidence and justify ongoing investment
- Transparency through progress reports and regular updates is planned to keep stakeholders informed (51:47)
- Consultant Megan emphasized addressing client skepticism upfront by showing measurable results quickly

Change adoption is challenging due to client skepticism and resistance to new workflows (20:43)

- Alyssa's previous negative experiences with consultants cause initial resistance
- The team plans to involve key personnel in interviews and workshops to build buy-in and uncover hidden issues (25:46)
- Educational support, such as linking SOPs to ChatGPT-like assistants, will help Alyssa understand task purposes and procedures

Consultants plan close collaboration with Kelsey and Alyssa, scheduling joint meetings to align expectations and clarify deliverables (61:26)

- Meetings will define clear 30-day goals and measurable outcomes to keep efforts focused
- Consultant involvement in calls with Alyssa will ensure detailed instructions and follow-up support
- This hands-on approach aims to reduce miscommunication and ensure alignment between client needs and delivered solutions

### Future Roadmap and Strategic Vision

The team's long-term vision is to build scalable, automated systems that allow Kelsey to focus on higher-value work while increasing business efficiency (04:54).

Initial focus is on stabilizing core daily operations before adding new features like website automation or multi-platform product listings (53:19)

- The team recognizes that advanced automation depends on having documented, repeatable workflows first
- Inventory management improvements are on the roadmap but will be prioritized based on ROI and readiness (54:46)
- The phased approach prevents overloading the client and ensures sustainable progress

The ultimate goal is to create a dashboard displaying ROI and operational metrics, reinforcing the value of the systems (24:10)

- This will quantify improvements and help maintain momentum for continuous process refinement
- Consultants view their role as partners helping Plotter Mechanics evolve through the current "fifth industrial revolution" (22:30)
- The focus remains on practical, measurable improvements that directly improve profit margins and reduce stress for Kelsey

Recording and analyzing daily communication patterns will create a data-driven foundation for future automation and process improvements (45:14)

- Capturing voice and task data allows precise SOP generation and highlights inefficiencies
- This method addresses Kelsey's unique communication style and operational challenges with tailored solutions
- Continuous iteration and feedback loops ensure the system evolves with the business needs over time
