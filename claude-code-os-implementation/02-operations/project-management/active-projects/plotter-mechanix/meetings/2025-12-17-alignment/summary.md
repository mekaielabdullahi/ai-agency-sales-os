## Strategic Notes

### Why Speed Matters
- Building trust with client = demonstrating results quickly
- End of January = must have working system improving operations
- Early wins → unlock bigger phases → longer relationship

### Revenue Reality
- $5K split among team = not enough for individual income needs
- This is a **pipeline builder**, not a full income replacement
- Balance needed: Project management + hourly work for bills
