# Weekly Report: Arise Group Work for Kelsey's Business

Hi Kelsey,

Here's a summary of what we accomplished this week and our plan for the week ahead.

---

## What We've Done

### Phone System Infrastructure
- **Vonage to Quo Migration** – We've mapped out the transition plan to move you from Vonage to Quo, which will give you better functionality and built-in call recording/transcription.
- **Call Recording & Transcription** – Planned automatic recording and transcription for all incoming calls through Quo.
- **Phone Number Strategy** – Determined how to integrate your personal cell and business number into the new system.

### Knowledge Base & Support Systems
- **Customer Support AI Agent** – Explored building an AI chatbot trained on your call transcripts to handle common troubleshooting questions before they reach you.
- **Service Manuals** – Gained access to your Dropbox with service manuals to feed into the knowledge base.

### Jobber Integration
- **Phone Number Integration** – Investigated integrating Quo with Jobber's phone system, specifically addressing the challenge that Jobber texts use a dedicated number while calls forward separately.
- **Asynchronous Updates** – Explored a ChatGPT-based interface so you can update Jobber tasks without calling Alyssa each time.
- **Automatic Task Creation** – Discussed converting call transcripts into Jobber tasks automatically.

### Client Communication Workflow
- **Call Routing** – Established routing: calls go to Alyssa first → overflow to you → after-hours handled separately.
- **WhatsApp Group** – Agreed to set up a group for real-time communication between our team and you.

## What We're Doing This Week

### Immediate Actions
- **Quo Testing** – Matthew and Trent will test Quo call quality before porting your number.
- **Jobber API Investigation** – Trent will investigate Jobber's API to determine if we can:
  - Make outbound caller ID appear as the Jobber dedicated number
  - Integrate transcribed call data directly into Jobber tasks
- **WhatsApp Group** – Chris will create the group connecting you with Matthew, Trent, and Mekaiel.
- **Email Access** – Matthew and Trent will get access to your email accounts (Sales, Service, Supplies, Printing, Design, and personal) to analyze communication patterns.

### Medium-Term
- **Call Transcription Workflow** – Set up automatic transcription and determine the best process for converting calls into Jobber tasks.
- **Knowledge Base Development** – Begin building the AI chatbot using your call transcripts and service manuals.
- **Jobber Tracking** – Investigate why automatic location tracking stopped working after the recent update.

Best,
**Arise Group Team**
