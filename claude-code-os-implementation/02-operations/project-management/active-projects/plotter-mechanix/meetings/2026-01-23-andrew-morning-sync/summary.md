# Summary: Plotter Mechanix + Andrew Morning Sync Up

**Meeting Date:** 2026-01-23

## Meeting Purpose

Define a new sales and service strategy to scale the business.

## Key Takeaways

- **New Sales Engine:** Andrew will lead supplies and service contract sales, freeing Kelsey to focus on high-value service and business development.
- **Immediate Action Plan:** Launch a supplies sales campaign using a Jobber list of service-only clients and integrate Andrew into the Quo phone system.
- **Strategic Hiring:** Recruit Steve, a highly skilled technician, as Service Manager to handle routine calls, enabling Kelsey to work *on* the business.
- **Service Contracts:** Implement recurring monthly contracts (e.g., $99/mo) to build stable revenue and overcome the sticker shock of large, upfront costs.

## Topics

### Problem: Operational Bottlenecks

- Kelsey is overwhelmed by daily operations, preventing focus on strategic growth.
- Alyssa lacks the industry knowledge for effective supplies sales or parts sourcing.
- The business lacks a system for tracking critical client data like serial numbers and maintenance history.

### Solution: New Sales & Service Strategy

**Andrew's Role:** Lead supplies sales and service contract development.
- **Initial Campaign:** Target service-only clients from a Jobber report to capture immediate supplies revenue.
- **Part Sourcing:** Leverage Andrew's expertise to find cheaper parts online (e.g., eBay).
- **Proposal Development:** Use Andrew's "Mechanics Pack" proposal as a template for future sales.

**Service Contracts:**
- **Model:** Monthly recurring billing (e.g., $99/mo) to build stable revenue and lower customer commitment barriers.
- **Positioning:** Frame contracts as a cost-neutral upgrade, with savings from compatible inks offsetting the monthly fee.
- **Targeting:** Apply a matrix to determine contract eligibility, avoiding high-risk machines like the PK Associates printer with 1.25M square feet on its meter.

### Enabler: Hiring Steve as Service Manager

- **Rationale:** Hiring Steve is the "quickest ticket to freedom," enabling Kelsey to transition from technician to business owner.
- **Incentive:** Offer Steve the Service Manager role with performance-based pay on service revenue and commissions on equipment sales.
- **Impact:** Frees Kelsey to focus on high-value tasks:
  - **Relationship Building:** Spend more time with customers, identifying new opportunities.
  - **Business Development:** Pursue strategic partnerships (e.g., car wraps with Gus).
  - **Content Creation:** Film service calls for marketing and training videos.

### Supporting Systems & Tools

- **Quo:** Integrate Andrew to make outbound calls from Kelsey's number, increasing customer answer rates.
- **Jobber:** Use for client lists, automated quote generation, and tracking.
- **Ply:** Continue implementation for inventory management; Andrew will provide expert feedback.
- **CRM:** A future phase two project to build a central repository for client data (serial numbers, maintenance history).
