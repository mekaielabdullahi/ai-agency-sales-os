[00:00:00] **mytpix LLC**: But we got, we got a full guarantee.

[00:00:02] **mytpix LLC**: Like he's selling this .

[00:00:03] **mytpix LLC**: He sold $2 million worth of this  without even having a backup support person.

[00:00:08] **mytpix LLC**: So like his, his sales pitch is powerful, dude, because he knows how to scare them.

[00:00:14] **Chris Andrade**: Well, good to have like, to see if you would be willing to let us record him when he's doing it to train other people, but I'm on a process right now, that is the same problem with my parents business, because they don't have a follow up and with their business, they need to have it in incremental stages along the process of their building getting built.

[00:00:40] **Chris Andrade**: But in your case, it's just the process of being serviced, maintenance, and then just a follow up, right?

[00:00:48] **Chris Andrade**: So there's a way that we can create this, let's just say, after service funnel, right, that creates a workflow for us to be that customer.

[00:00:59] **mytpix LLC**: customer service enhancement, and then just go and create something, right, and then, well, yeah, well, this is how I envision it, I already, I already made an, I had a list yesterday, create, we'll give Andrew the back end door to the supplies at Potter Mechanics, log into Jobber, so that he can get in there and see what's going on with the current supplies things, so it's all going to be handled through us, you know, like, we're going to handle this whole funnel and everything, but I think the best way to handle the recordings would be to get Andrew on Quo with us, because that way when he calls out on my behalf, he's calling out of my number, right, and that way when the customer gets the phone call, it's not some California-based cell phone, it's my actual number that, and within a week, whoever we were dealing with were fresh in their mind, you know, like, so if we do call, I've already talked to him, I scheduled him, I sent him a text when I was coming, and all this kind of , so when he does call,

[00:02:00] **mytpix LLC**: They're going to be like, Oh, it's plotter mechanics.

[00:02:02] **mytpix LLC**: Hang on.

[00:02:03] **mytpix LLC**: You know, like at least they'll have a chance of somebody answering.

[00:02:06] **Chris Andrade**: How do you see your customers getting notified or getting, or like, was Andrew just going to be calling them on a, on a schedule?

[00:02:16] **Chris Andrade**: What does that look like?

[00:02:18] **mytpix LLC**: Well, right now, what it looks like is I have different types of clients and you can look in Jobber and you can see if they're purchasing supplies from me.

[00:02:26] **mytpix LLC**: So every one of the customers that I've serviced that have never bought a supplies product, need a, I need an Excel spreadsheet of all those people or, or something I'm sure we can generate one out of Jobber.

[00:02:37] **mytpix LLC**: And I want to start with that list.

[00:02:38] **mytpix LLC**: That's warm and say, Hey, Andrew, I want you to go through this list.

[00:02:41] **mytpix LLC**: These are all the clients that I've done service work for, and I have not sold them any supplies.

[00:02:47] **mytpix LLC**: So any supplies that you're able to gather out of this is going to be our supplies business that we're going to gain.

[00:02:52] **mytpix LLC**: And then you're, you're going to get your commission.

[00:02:53] **mytpix LLC**: I'm going to get a commission and I'm not going to do anything.

[00:02:55] **mytpix LLC**: Like I'm not, he's going to do the follow-up work.

[00:02:58] **mytpix LLC**: He's working with Alyssa right now.

[00:02:59] **mytpix LLC**: Like he,

[00:03:00] **mytpix LLC**: He's always been Alyssa's back in person.

[00:03:04] **mytpix LLC**: She doesn't understand this industry.

[00:03:06] **mytpix LLC**: She doesn't understand the printers.

[00:03:07] **mytpix LLC**: She doesn't understand the parts that go into them.

[00:03:09] **mytpix LLC**: None of that stuff.

[00:03:09] **mytpix LLC**: And then in addition to that, he's willing to help me source parts because he knows how to get parts cheap online.

[00:03:15] **mytpix LLC**: He's got all kinds of connections all over the place.

[00:03:17] **mytpix LLC**: So when I need a part now and I get ply installed and he's on the back end of it, however, you know, like I need this motherboard, Andrew, and he can go out on eBay and  and find it cheaper than what I'm getting it for.

[00:03:32] **mytpix LLC**: So Alyssa sucks at sourcing parts, dude.

[00:03:34] **mytpix LLC**: She can't do it.

[00:03:35] **mytpix LLC**: So we, she doesn't even know where to get the part from, bro.

[00:03:37] **mytpix LLC**: Like it's a Hewlett Packard.

[00:03:38] **mytpix LLC**: We only buy Hewlett Packard parts from A&A Graphics for the last six months.

[00:03:42] **mytpix LLC**: And I say, need an HP belt.

[00:03:43] **mytpix LLC**: She's like, where should I get it from?

[00:03:45] **mytpix LLC**: So we need to get ads.

[00:03:47] **Chris Andrade**: We just need to get the spreadsheet going to generate the list and then get Andrew set up on QO.

[00:03:53] **Chris Andrade**: And that would at least get something going.

[00:03:55] **Chris Andrade**: That would be something.

[00:03:56] **mytpix LLC**: I mean, that would be something we could start like today.

[00:03:59] **mytpix LLC**: be something like today because he's...

[00:04:00] **mytpix LLC**: He's sitting over there idle with time on his hands and nothing to do and willing to spend his time with me, which flabbergasts me, dude.

[00:04:06] **mytpix LLC**: Like, I can't believe that I have this powerful of a resource.

[00:04:10] **mytpix LLC**: I mean, he's a better salesman than anybody I know, dude.

[00:04:13] **Matthew Kerns**: Right.

[00:04:14] **Matthew Kerns**: And he knows this industry and he's been involved in it for the last.

[00:04:17] **mytpix LLC**: And if he has a company to back up his sales pitch, bro, it's over, man.

[00:04:22] **mytpix LLC**: Like, he's going to be able to sell a shitload of supplies and get residual business.

[00:04:26] **mytpix LLC**: And when we go in on a new sale, he even knows how to sell it.

[00:04:32] **mytpix LLC**: The, you know, like the printer only costs $5,900.

[00:04:36] **mytpix LLC**: The ink cartridge costs $3,500.

[00:04:38] **mytpix LLC**: I'm going to share what he put together last night.

[00:04:40] **mytpix LLC**: And then he came up with a contract called, HP calls it a care pack.

[00:04:43] **mytpix LLC**: He calls it a mechanics pack.

[00:04:46] **Chris Andrade**: Can we see what that proposal looks like?

[00:04:50] **Chris Andrade**: Just so we can use it as a reference to make it clear.

[00:04:57] **mytpix LLC**: You guys got a minute or no?

[00:04:59] **mytpix LLC**: Yeah, I mean.

[00:05:00] **Chris Andrade**: Yeah, I mean, if the guys need to fall off, I'm here for you, you know, but we're, I'm here.

[00:05:06] **Chris Andrade**: Well, let's, let me, let me just text him and see if I can bring him in this meeting.

[00:05:09] **mytpix LLC**: And then if everybody needs to leave, whatever, but you're recording it, right?

[00:05:12] **mytpix LLC**: Yeah.

[00:05:13] **mytpix LLC**: Yeah.

[00:05:13] **Chris Andrade**: So let me see.

[00:05:14] **Chris Andrade**: I just texted him on accident this morning while I was driving.

[00:05:17] **Chris Andrade**: Trent has to leave soon.

[00:05:19] **Chris Andrade**: Do you have any questions for him before he leaves?

[00:05:22] **mytpix LLC**: I got a shitload of them, but I don't know what they are right now.

[00:05:24] **mytpix LLC**: Hey, yeah, Kelsey.

[00:05:25] **Trent Christopher**: So, so the primary thing I'm focused on right now is that if we need to change anything about way Quo works, like with Alyssa and your calls, I'm not talking about Andrew right now, just talking about you and Alyssa.

[00:05:39] **mytpix LLC**: Um, let me know.

[00:05:41] **mytpix LLC**: think you need to do anything with that right now, because like, now that the contacts are in there and, and when it rings, we know who's calling, then I kind of know what's going on.

[00:05:50] **mytpix LLC**: And I can, I'm only answering the calls that are coming up in my phone that don't have a name associated with it.

[00:05:56] **mytpix LLC**: Like, you know what I mean?

[00:05:57] **mytpix LLC**: Like when I see a number, I'm like, who is that being I'm.

[00:06:00] **mytpix LLC**: Grabbing those.

[00:06:00] **mytpix LLC**: But if I see that it's somebody calling that might need service or supplies, that's an existing customer, I'm going to back off of those.

[00:06:06] **mytpix LLC**: And after some, after so many rings, I want Alyssa to grab it.

[00:06:09] **mytpix LLC**: So I wanted to ring for a while.

[00:06:10] **mytpix LLC**: That's fine.

[00:06:11] **Trent Christopher**: If you want to put a menu system in place, you just let us know.

[00:06:14] **Trent Christopher**: won't take us very long to do that.

[00:06:15] **Trent Christopher**: Like if you want to do, you know, one for supplies and it gets rerouted to Alyssa or whatever, then we can do that.

[00:06:22] **Trent Christopher**: No, I think, I think that's what we're going to do.

[00:06:24] **mytpix LLC**: But the thing is, I need to get Andrew in on this because I want him to receive the supplies.

[00:06:30] **mytpix LLC**: inquiries because Alyssa is busy with a whole bunch of other , dude.

[00:06:34] **mytpix LLC**: And we're, if we're going to implement ply right now and try and get that going, she's going to, she's going to need to focus on that with my sister-in-law and get that rolling.

[00:06:42] **mytpix LLC**: And my sister-in is learning it right now.

[00:06:44] **mytpix LLC**: And then she's going to teach Alyssa how to use it.

[00:06:46] **Trent Christopher**: And in some ways, what we're trying to do is even more important to be able to free her up in some way, shape or form.

[00:06:56] **Trent Christopher**: Right.

[00:06:56] **Trent Christopher**: Yeah.

[00:06:56] **Trent Christopher**: And she's constantly all day long.

[00:06:58] **mytpix LLC**: Like, you know, until we get this.

[00:07:00] **Chris Andrade**: It's a little bit more solid like she's I mean she's busy dude like she's busy doing everything and that's how I was talking to you about Kelsey is like right now you know I'm there I could be a relief pitcher bro.

[00:07:14] **Chris Andrade**: I could step in and help out when I'm already I'm already I mean I'm not I'm not trying to not.

[00:07:20] **mytpix LLC**: I'm not trying to bring Andrew in and replace what we talked about.

[00:07:25] **mytpix LLC**: I'm just trying to bring Andrew in so that you and me can spend more time together because that's kind of what supplies my back I don't want to deal with the supplies monkey dude I don't want to I don't want to I want somebody that's knowledgeable that has patience and is better on the phone than me I'm too I don't have time dude if I if I send this late I haven't sent the latest quote yet but I'm going to but mine would have been a three line quote dude I've just been like the shittiest thing I could do in my cell phone and send it over Andrew developed a whole contract a whole everything to put together so the next time we actually

[00:08:00] **mytpix LLC**: Send one out, we can just use that template and keep doing it over and over.

[00:08:04] **mytpix LLC**: You know, you can save templates in a job or for equipment sale or a service call or whatever you want.

[00:08:10] **mytpix LLC**: can start with the thing right out of the gate.

[00:08:11] **mytpix LLC**: Oh, Andrew's calling me.

[00:08:14] **mytpix LLC**: I don't know if it's going happen, but I'll text him.

[00:08:17] **Chris Andrade**: I could text him that link or just forward him that Google Meet that I sent you.

[00:08:22] **Chris Andrade**: Yeah, he has to answer the call.

[00:08:24] **Matthew Kerns**: So I'm curious how Ply works into everything, and if it needs to be accelerated, their integration with it, then we can potentially jump in.

[00:08:37] **Matthew Kerns**: I don't necessarily want to push that because he's already said that Megan is working on it, but...

[00:08:43] **Chris Andrade**: To honest, it seems like we're kind of being held at an arm's length.

[00:08:50] **Chris Andrade**: Like, they want to try to figure stuff out on their own, and kudos, bro.

[00:08:53] **Chris Andrade**: Like, let them be like, that's what we want, right?

[00:08:56] **Chris Andrade**: We want to encourage you.

[00:08:57] **Trent Christopher**: Yeah, in some way, shape, or form, they're able to do it.

[00:09:02] **Chris Andrade**: They're not paying our services.

[00:09:04] **Trent Christopher**: So we have to think about it from their perspective too, right?

[00:09:09] **Chris Andrade**: It's not that they don't want us to do it.

[00:09:12] **Trent Christopher**: It's that they're trying to take ownership of it.

[00:09:16] **Chris Andrade**: This is exactly what we want at the end of the day.

[00:09:20] **Matthew Kerns**: Yeah, exactly.

[00:09:21] **Matthew Kerns**: We want them to be able to scale because the sooner he can scale and bring more money in, the more he can pay us, the more problems they're going to have.

[00:09:30] **Matthew Kerns**: And the more we're going to be able to solve bigger problems for them.

[00:09:32] **Chris Andrade**: We want to fix the problems that they are trying to already solve and make it even better.

[00:09:38] **Chris Andrade**: Hey.

[00:09:40] **Chris Andrade**: What's up, Kelsey?

[00:09:41] **Matthew Kerns**: You're on mute.

[00:09:44] **Chris Andrade**: You're on mute.

[00:09:49] **Chris Andrade**: There you go.

[00:09:51] **Chris Andrade**: Can you hear me now?

[00:09:52] **Chris Andrade**: Yeah.

[00:09:53] **Chris Andrade**: Okay.

[00:09:53] **mytpix LLC**: Here, let me...

[00:09:54] **mytpix LLC**: Do you have Andrew's number, Chris?

[00:09:58] **mytpix LLC**: Yes.

[00:09:58] **Chris Andrade**: I just send Can I just send this...

[00:10:00] **Chris Andrade**: Link you sent me, or do you have to send it?

[00:10:02] **Chris Andrade**: Copy, and just, or forward.

[00:10:05] **Chris Andrade**: Yeah, just copy it and send it to him.

[00:10:07] **Chris Andrade**: Okay, here we go.

[00:10:08] **mytpix LLC**: Let me paste this in here real good.

[00:10:10] **mytpix LLC**: He said as long as he doesn't have to use his camera, because I think he's still in bed.

[00:10:13] **mytpix LLC**: It's California.

[00:10:15] **Trent Christopher**: Well, Matthew's in California, too.

[00:10:17] **Matthew Kerns**: Yeah.

[00:10:20] **Matthew Kerns**: My camera's off.

[00:10:22] **Matthew Kerns**: That's cool.

[00:10:23] **Matthew Kerns**: I don't need to see you guys.

[00:10:24] **Matthew Kerns**: They're required cameras.

[00:10:25] **Trent Christopher**: It's okay.

[00:10:25] **mytpix LLC**: I just sent in the link right now, so let's see if you can get in here or not.

[00:10:29] **mytpix LLC**: I'm going to coffee real quick.

[00:10:34] **Matthew Kerns**: Turn off on the go.

[00:10:36] **mytpix LLC**: Okay, there we go.

[00:10:37] **mytpix LLC**: I need a cell phone now for my car.

[00:10:38] **mytpix LLC**: Anyways, so Andrew, because I'm not, I don't want to be the guy for the supplies thing, and especially the way that Andrew does it and the way that he's profitable doing it.

[00:10:50] **Matthew Kerns**: There's, every situation is different.

[00:10:52] **mytpix LLC**: You know, like, you know what I'm saying, Matthew?

[00:10:55] **mytpix LLC**: Yeah.

[00:10:56] **mytpix LLC**: Yeah.

[00:10:56] **Matthew Kerns**: Yeah.

[00:10:57] **Matthew Kerns**: So basically, like, Alyssa's not quick enough on...

[00:11:07] **mytpix LLC**: I love talking to him.

[00:11:11] **mytpix LLC**: I actually want to buy stuff from him when he gets done talking to me.

[00:11:14] **mytpix LLC**: Yeah, I think it's perfect.

[00:11:15] **Matthew Kerns**: It's great that you know that Andrew wants to do it.

[00:11:21] **Matthew Kerns**: It's like plugging in a puzzle piece that's just growing your business.

[00:11:26] **Matthew Kerns**: Did Andrew come in?

[00:11:27] **Matthew Kerns**: Yeah, I'm here.

[00:11:29] **mytpix LLC**: Oh, sweet.

[00:11:29] **mytpix LLC**: Yeah.

[00:11:30] **mytpix LLC**: So I was just talking to these guys about some of the things that we've been talking about.

[00:11:35] **mytpix LLC**: And I was they were asking me, like, what does it look like or whatever?

[00:11:39] **mytpix LLC**: And I said, one thing that we could do right now is just pull up a report of everybody that we've worked with just since we started using Jobber, which is the last year.

[00:11:48] **mytpix LLC**: And everybody that we've serviced and not sold supplies to, let's get a list of those.

[00:11:53] **mytpix LLC**: And then you can just do in your spare time follow ups to just those existing clients.

[00:11:58] **mytpix LLC**: comments.

[00:11:58] **mytpix LLC**: Yeah.

[00:11:59] **mytpix LLC**: Yeah.

[00:12:00] **Customer Service**: Yeah, Kelsey, I was gonna ask you a question about just two things.

[00:12:06] **Customer Service**: The first thing is, you know, the opportunity to sell them supplies, obviously, is when you're there just in front of them.

[00:12:14] **Customer Service**: And, you know, as far as me kind of calling them saying, how's your printer working?

[00:12:20] **Customer Service**: You know, we did service a year ago, whatever, that those two approaches are fine.

[00:12:24] **Customer Service**: I was wondering in your industry, if you think it makes sense to try to adopt clients to pay kind of like prepay for service is like a service contract sort of thing.

[00:12:37] **Customer Service**: So like, if one of these clients is, you know, out in the thick of things, and you say, hey, you know, you should buy a service contract, because, you know, it's just going to be better value for you, because nobody's going to want to come out to service your machine.

[00:12:52] **Customer Service**: And, you know, you could get some recurring revenue by just selling them, like, you know, oh, you know, it's

[00:13:00] **Customer Service**: It's $700 a year or whatever, $600 a year, and you could just start billing clients, you know, for basically, you know, like a sort of a extended warranty type thing where.

[00:13:12] **mytpix LLC**: I mean, that's the only reason that my old company is still floating right now, actually, is when I had interacted with my old business partner, they had converted a shitload of their people over to contracts and they were they were paying the girls like a commission to do it.

[00:13:27] **mytpix LLC**: So they were doing it.

[00:13:28] **mytpix LLC**: So now they got a  tone of customers under a maintenance contract and now they're dropping the ball on them, dude.

[00:13:33] **mytpix LLC**: So pretty soon people are going to be calling me going like, hey, our printer is all  up and we have a contract over there, but no one answered the phone.

[00:13:39] **mytpix LLC**: I think that's where it's heading.

[00:13:41] **mytpix LLC**: Yeah, guess.

[00:13:41] **mytpix LLC**: Right.

[00:13:42] **mytpix LLC**: That's yeah.

[00:13:42] **Customer Service**: Be maintenance contract.

[00:13:43] **Customer Service**: Just like.

[00:13:45] **mytpix LLC**: So they're going to want something like that because they already had something like that, but we're going to have to fix it first and charge them.

[00:13:51] **mytpix LLC**: And then we're going to offer them the contract after we finish, you know, and then.

[00:13:55] **mytpix LLC**: Yes, absolutely.

[00:13:56] **mytpix LLC**: I think that doing contracts is a great idea, dude, because like.

[00:14:00] **mytpix LLC**: Like my, you know, from my experience of the few contracts I've sold, and you can run a report on there, I don't have a way to keep track of what the expense was, but I do have a pretty good idea in my head.

[00:14:11] **Customer Service**: I mean, it's also not as hard of a sell because you could say, hey, this is what HP, Canon, Epson, everyone is moving in this direction.

[00:14:23] **Customer Service**: You know, and so, you know, they're going to try to sell you this from, you know, and then they just sub it out to me or whatever.

[00:14:31] **Customer Service**: You should just do it directly with my company because it's just half the price.

[00:14:36] **Customer Service**: And you got my cell phone number.

[00:14:38] **mytpix LLC**: Yeah.

[00:14:39] **mytpix LLC**: And we're going to show up and help you.

[00:14:41] **mytpix LLC**: You're not going to have to go to India.

[00:14:42] **mytpix LLC**: Like, there's so many reasons why somebody would want to buy it from us over the manufacturer.

[00:14:46] **mytpix LLC**: Right, yeah.

[00:14:47] **mytpix LLC**: And you know, you know all of the pitches to sell them, and then, you know, we can start adopting that into, like, just our marketing campaigns and stuff down the road when we start growing and whatnot.

[00:14:57] **mytpix LLC**: And, yeah, no, I.

[00:15:04] **Customer Service**: I think also folds into the bigger picture of selling them supplies because it's like, hey, now that you're buying supplies from us or the other way where if they buy a service contract, you could say, hey, if you're buying crap from China on Amazon, it's not going to align with the service contract.

[00:15:27] **Customer Service**: You know, it'd be better.

[00:15:29] **Customer Service**: You know, if you're using OEM supplies, I mean, honestly, we could we could say this.

[00:15:34] **mytpix LLC**: If we go into an account that is buying OEM inks, Andrew, we could say, look, we want to we want to come in here.

[00:15:40] **mytpix LLC**: We want to we want to save you whatever percent on your current supplies, convert them over to either yours or compatibles exclusively if they're local.

[00:15:48] **mytpix LLC**: And then the money that they would have paid for the contract will be paid for by the ink savings, dude.

[00:15:54] **mytpix LLC**: It's a no brainer.

[00:15:55] **mytpix LLC**: Oh, that's a good point.

[00:15:56] **Customer Service**: Yeah.

[00:15:57] **Customer Service**: Um, and there.

[00:16:00] **mytpix LLC**: They're only going to be calling us because they don't have a warranty anyways, dude.

[00:16:03] **mytpix LLC**: HP doesn't give a  they have a T930, but man, I could fix the hell out of those things.

[00:16:07] **Customer Service**: I was going to say that you could offer the service contract on some of these machines that you could fix with your eyes closed, you know?

[00:16:14] **mytpix LLC**: Well, and then once you help me figure out, once we get my inventory down and we start gutting these machines that I'm throwing away, we'll have a whole pile full of parts and inventory of what they are.

[00:16:24] **mytpix LLC**: So like if a motherboard goes bad and that's a $700 part, we have it sitting on the shelf.

[00:16:28] **mytpix LLC**: didn't even pay for it.

[00:16:29] **mytpix LLC**: Right.

[00:16:31] **Customer Service**: And then we're making money on that.

[00:16:32] **Customer Service**: I'm making, I make money on that, bro.

[00:16:34] **mytpix LLC**: Like I'm just telling you guys in general on my service contracts, I have come out way ahead.

[00:16:39] **mytpix LLC**: Like if I made $10,000, I didn't even spend a thousand.

[00:16:44] **mytpix LLC**: And, and we have examples of campaigns that have been ran before.

[00:16:51] **Chris Andrade**: No, I've never ran a campaign or I guess, or even what a service contract would look like.

[00:16:57] **Chris Andrade**: Like, yeah, Andrew just sent me what it looks like last.

[00:17:00] **mytpix LLC**: It looks badass.

[00:17:01] **mytpix LLC**: Hey, Andrew, wanted to share these guys' information, like the quote you put together, the proposal, and that contract thing you sent me after we got the pricing.

[00:17:09] **mytpix LLC**: I wanted to share that.

[00:17:11] **mytpix LLC**: I just can't find it right now.

[00:17:14] **Chris Andrade**: Andrew, I mean, we can sign, you know, we're here for you guys, ultimately.

[00:17:20] **Chris Andrade**: So if that is any issues, we're here, we can fix that.

[00:17:26] **Chris Andrade**: Andrew, I'm sorry, what was it?

[00:17:29] **Chris Andrade**: Andrew, if you need, like, an NDA, or if this is any, like, information that you don't, you know.

[00:17:35] **Chris Andrade**: Andrew, I don't, no, no, no, I don't care.

[00:17:38] **mytpix LLC**: Andrew, because I'm not basically doing anything with service contracts right now, zero, and I'm only selling my compatible supplies.

[00:17:50] **mytpix LLC**: And the only time I convert a customer over to my supplies is when I go into an Amazon situation where they just butchered their printer, and I'm like, look, I can get you OEMs, which is what I would recommend, or else I can sell you.

[00:18:00] **mytpix LLC**: My compatibles and I'll support them, but I mean, so I'm not doing any, I'm only just playing defense, man.

[00:18:05] **mytpix LLC**: I'm not doing any, I'm outbound sales for equipment.

[00:18:08] **mytpix LLC**: So all of that is being just tossed to the side.

[00:18:12] **mytpix LLC**: And if I, if I wanted to do it, then I just burden Alyssa and myself with it, because then I tell her I need to do this, but she doesn't know how to do it.

[00:18:20] **mytpix LLC**: So she comes to me.

[00:18:21] **mytpix LLC**: So I want her to, I want to tell her we need to do this, her, and then she goes to Andrew and he helps her put it together and figure out the problem.

[00:18:30] **mytpix LLC**: Pricing and stuff, because we don't, we don't know.

[00:18:31] **mytpix LLC**: I don't know.

[00:18:32] **mytpix LLC**: Andrew knows the industry.

[00:18:33] **mytpix LLC**: He knows what's the pricing of the, he knows where to get source parts.

[00:18:37] **mytpix LLC**: mean, there's a whole bunch of things going on right here.

[00:18:40] **Chris Andrade**: Like I don't even know what we talked about is getting his spreadsheet to ultimately create this.

[00:18:48] **Chris Andrade**: I, we're trying to figure out what a lead funnel would look like and how do we create it?

[00:18:53] **Chris Andrade**: Do you have any ideas on?

[00:18:55] **Chris Andrade**: So what I'm thinking in general is like, Andrew,

[00:19:00] **Matthew Kerns**: You know exactly what you're doing, like, and we can just be available as a resource to, like, if there's, you know, things that are taking up time or you notice that there's a constraint or a bottleneck, and we can sort of be there to just be like an AI resource.

[00:19:26] **Matthew Kerns**: Like, anything that we identify as, like, potential integration between what, Andrew, what you're doing and plotter mechanics, if there's any sort of difficulty or annoying thing, we can tie technologies together.

[00:19:42] **Matthew Kerns**: We can use the AI.

[00:19:45] **mytpix LLC**: Well, currently my website, Matthew.

[00:19:48] **mytpix LLC**: Okay.

[00:19:49] **mytpix LLC**: And Andrew has a website already that works, I believe.

[00:19:54] **mytpix LLC**: Sorry, brushing my teeth.

[00:19:56] **Customer Service**: Yeah, I do.

[00:19:58] **Customer Service**: Okay.

[00:19:59] **Matthew Kerns**: And he's already gone.

[00:20:00] **mytpix LLC**: Got the pricing, the information, the part numbers, and all that  right the way it is.

[00:20:04] **mytpix LLC**: I've got a bunch of crap that other people have done for me and mine, and I don't even know what it is, dude.

[00:20:08] **mytpix LLC**: I'd rather, I mean, I know we're not starting over my website right now, but I like a lot of things that are on my website as far as the content goes, but the actual way it works in the background and connects to my systems is garbage.

[00:20:21] **mytpix LLC**: And so I don't know when we're going to delve into that, but I'm ready to make a transition out of Shopify even.

[00:20:28] **mytpix LLC**: Like, I don't even like Shopify.

[00:20:30] **mytpix LLC**: Like, I think with your guys' skills, there's a better way to put the website in place.

[00:20:34] **mytpix LLC**: Yeah, I know.

[00:20:35] **Customer Service**: Yeah, Kelsey, I'm not really sure.

[00:20:37] **Customer Service**: I don't want to confuse customers, but I was trying to figure out how to do this.

[00:20:42] **Customer Service**: Like, you know, with this customer, it's going to order, like, the full package, you know, potentially of inks and a service contract and all that stuff, and we invoice them and they pay.

[00:20:51] **Customer Service**: It obviously makes sense to just have that be all on one, you know, invoice and one PO, and you bill them and they pay however they pay and just keep

[00:21:00] **Customer Service**: Keep it simple.

[00:21:01] **Customer Service**: If I'm calling them and trying to close the sale, it probably just makes sense on my side to just invoice them without having to involve Alyssa and or if they want to order it on my website, I can just send them a link and just say you and I are partners.

[00:21:21] **Customer Service**: And I just already have the back end infrastructure to do that.

[00:21:24] **Customer Service**: And just whatever makes sense to be invoiced on your side.

[00:21:29] **Customer Service**: We can do that.

[00:21:30] **Customer Service**: And then I think I don't know it's better.

[00:21:33] **mytpix LLC**: I think I mean, I understand what you're saying, but I think that you should get paid a higher return on the things that you're bringing to the table because I'm not going to do it, dude.

[00:21:43] **mytpix LLC**: And like, but I think that as far as the overall strategy goes, it would be a better deal.

[00:21:49] **mytpix LLC**: Like if I just if I just left the customer and I said, hey, I'm going to have my supplies guy call you and then you call from your cell phone in in California, they're not going to answer.

[00:21:58] **mytpix LLC**: But if you call from my

[00:22:24] **Customer Service**: That sounds like a very smart idea.

[00:22:27] **Customer Service**: I guess the part that I was talking about when these guys were talking about the AI integration and all that stuff is like, if you're saying your website's just, you know, tough to work with, I don't really want to, at least on the beginning side of things, I don't want to crawl into your QuickBooks and start trying to invoice clients and all this sort of stuff.

[00:22:50] **Customer Service**: I think it'll just, and I don't want to have Alyssa be the one that has to like get in.

[00:22:55] **mytpix LLC**: No, no, you won't.

[00:22:56] **mytpix LLC**: You won't have to, man.

[00:22:57] **mytpix LLC**: Like job or like the stuff these guys are doing.

[00:23:00] **mytpix LLC**: Like, Trent can have it to where if a customer calls in and they say supplies, we say, well, what kind of machine do you have?

[00:23:06] **mytpix LLC**: And whatever.

[00:23:07] **mytpix LLC**: And then it can generate the quote automatically and send it to them and not even touch it, dude.

[00:23:12] **mytpix LLC**: As long as we have everything set up in Jabra, right?

[00:23:15] **mytpix LLC**: Am I correct?

[00:23:17] **Matthew Kerns**: Yeah, we can set up some automated quote generation that just either goes to you guys so you can validate it before sending it.

[00:23:26] **Matthew Kerns**: Once it gets good enough, you can send it to them.

[00:23:29] **Matthew Kerns**: This is the way I envision it.

[00:23:30] **Matthew Kerns**: Check this out.

[00:23:32] **mytpix LLC**: Customer calls in, they have a design jet.

[00:23:34] **mytpix LLC**: They have an XL 5000 design jet.

[00:23:37] **mytpix LLC**: Okay.

[00:23:38] **mytpix LLC**: We send them a quote with everything that XL design jet takes.

[00:23:42] **mytpix LLC**: So it gets the maintenance cartridge, the maintenance box, the full set of cartridges that we want to present to them.

[00:23:47] **mytpix LLC**: And then they can uncheck the things they don't want because a lot of people don't even know they have a maintenance box on their printer or whatever.

[00:23:54] **mytpix LLC**: And then tell it's out of ink and they call me on a Friday and say, I'm okay, my job done.

[00:23:57] **mytpix LLC**: And I'm like, oh , let me drive over across town.

[00:24:08] **mytpix LLC**: And I recommend this highly too, especially if they're using compatibles, like, you should have a full set on hand all times, dude, we offer 100% money back guarantee, blah, blah, blah.

[00:24:35] **mytpix LLC**: But like, you should inventory this stuff in your shop.

[00:24:37] **mytpix LLC**: So that when you run out of ink, you're not freaking out, you know, and then when you then you have a grace period to before it, you know, before we have to overnight the  and charge you $50 for free.

[00:24:52] **Matthew Kerns**: Yeah.

[00:24:52] **Customer Service**: So, yeah, I mean, that's, that's a, that's always going to be a struggle to get people to, to commit.

[00:25:00] **Customer Service**: You know, they're just always operating on, you know, emergencies, but some people are good and take the advice.

[00:25:08] **mytpix LLC**: But I'm going to start going after bigger customers, dude, because now that I have, if I have you as a resource, like, I'm not going to go after anybody if I have to do the work.

[00:25:17] **mytpix LLC**: Right.

[00:25:17] **mytpix LLC**: Because it's just too, it's too much for me right now.

[00:25:21] **mytpix LLC**: So, but I, I'm a talker, dude.

[00:25:23] **mytpix LLC**: And like, in the last three weeks of me going to church every day at six o'clock in the morning, like God's done a transformation in me, dude.

[00:25:30] **mytpix LLC**: Like I'm like literally like sitting down with everybody and like, I know my mission now.

[00:25:34] **mytpix LLC**: I didn't know what it was before.

[00:25:36] **mytpix LLC**: And I've been struggling with this, but God gave me this opportunity to interact with different people every day, dude.

[00:25:42] **mytpix LLC**: That's my mission field.

[00:25:43] **mytpix LLC**: It's not going to Ethiopia and feeding the hungry.

[00:25:46] **mytpix LLC**: Right.

[00:25:48] **Customer Service**: So, and people are hungry for it, dude.

[00:25:50] **mytpix LLC**: Like, I mean, I'm literally like all these people that have known me, that have seen me and whatever I'm sitting down and like, I'm talking to them.

[00:25:56] **mytpix LLC**: Like, they're just like, it's just like a different thing.

[00:26:00] **mytpix LLC**: Dude, like I'm just building relationships everywhere I go.

[00:26:03] **mytpix LLC**: And I have, you know, my toolbox is getting bigger, like we talked about.

[00:26:07] **mytpix LLC**: And I and like right here, right over here, I got a guy that wraps cars, and all that stuff, man, a whole printing guy, just sitting over here with no work to do.

[00:26:17] **Customer Service**: So I could do a similar thing like this with printing the guy across the street over here builds wood frames and stuff like we could, I have a whole print shop here that I'm not even using like that's a whole nother business model that we could pursue down the road one But yeah, I mean, I think that things that you really, I think that the slam dunks and the things that don't pull you in opposite directions, right now, are offering a service contract and selling supplies, I don't think that changes anything you're doing to bring in money on your end and pulling you in an opposite direction.

[00:26:52] **Customer Service**: And some of those other things, probably are promising, but you know, there's only one of you.

[00:26:57] **Customer Service**: So I like that.

[00:26:59] **Customer Service**: But I think,

[00:27:00] **Customer Service**: I this is just like the obvious start to low-hanging fruit and doesn't have to take you away from what you're doing good at.

[00:27:08] **Customer Service**: No, no.

[00:27:10] **mytpix LLC**: Once we figure this strategy out, I can implement it the same way because the thing is when I pull up in front of my customer, I'm going to get my car wrapped.

[00:27:16] **mytpix LLC**: I'm going to show up and I'm like, damn, who wrecked your car?

[00:27:19] **mytpix LLC**: I'm going to say, I did it.

[00:27:21] **mytpix LLC**: Instead of saying like, I had this one guy do it, I'm going to say, I did it.

[00:27:26] **mytpix LLC**: I got an installer, I got a designer, and I got all the equipment sitting in my shop just waiting idle for another wrap.

[00:27:32] **mytpix LLC**: You want to get one done?

[00:27:32] **mytpix LLC**: How about we do your whole fleet?

[00:27:34] **mytpix LLC**: Boom.

[00:27:35] **Chris Andrade**: Exactly.

[00:27:37] **mytpix LLC**: And then I just get the lead.

[00:27:40] **mytpix LLC**: comes into Jobber and it goes over to Gus and then Gus does the interaction with the customer.

[00:27:45] **mytpix LLC**: And then I get a piece of the action, but it keeps it under my umbrella and I can manage it.

[00:27:51] **mytpix LLC**: Right.

[00:27:52] **mytpix LLC**: So Andrew, this is kind of where this is my experience.

[00:27:56] **Chris Andrade**: This is kind of what I have been doing for over a decade.

[00:28:00] **Chris Andrade**: And it's kind of how I kind of got to meet Kelsey in a sense.

[00:28:03] **Chris Andrade**: So it's just if you have the infrastructure to support it, right?

[00:28:09] **Chris Andrade**: And at the end of the day, and that's, I guess, all we're trying to do.

[00:28:12] **Chris Andrade**: I really like your feedback on the low hanging fruit, because those are what the quick wins that help us get us to the next level, right?

[00:28:21] **Chris Andrade**: And to get Kelsey down the road even further to capture more of the river of opportunity.

[00:28:30] **mytpix LLC**: Yeah, well, I mean, first of all, in a unique position, like, I mean, I'm in front of people.

[00:28:36] **mytpix LLC**: Let me just say something.

[00:28:39] **Chris Andrade**: All I was going to say is Kelsey is a dreamer.

[00:28:42] **Customer Service**: And this is like what you need for, you know, for for the for the leader to be a dreamer, because that's, that's, that's, you know, but I it's so that I just think that him racking his brain and figuring out, you know, how this all can work together is great.

[00:29:00] **Customer Service**: Yeah, and at the end of the day, you can't do it by yourself.

[00:29:03] **Chris Andrade**: You have to have a team, right?

[00:29:05] **Chris Andrade**: And that's ultimately where us, we come in to support those decisions, to encourage them, but to make sure that they don't create more chaos and headache.

[00:29:18] **Chris Andrade**: As long as it's incremental gains, that's all that matters.

[00:29:22] **Chris Andrade**: Yeah, but you're right, Kelsey, that doesn't make sense.

[00:29:24] **Customer Service**: If you're able to wrap your car, and it all ties together, and it's something you're just delegating to a neighbor, then that's a slam dunk.

[00:29:37] **mytpix LLC**: Dude, wrapped my wife's, I wrapped my wife's 2007 Lexus for her in this, like, purplish, like, metallic-y color, and I really, yeah, and I, and so, like, I'm at the car wash, and some people just come up to me, dude, wow, your car looks so cool, who did that?

[00:29:56] **mytpix LLC**: I go, wow, this Mexican guy that I know down here on the corner.

[00:30:00] **mytpix LLC**: That's not, I did it.

[00:30:01] **mytpix LLC**: Here's my business card.

[00:30:02] **mytpix LLC**: You want to get one done?

[00:30:03] **mytpix LLC**: Call me.

[00:30:04] **mytpix LLC**: And then when the printing call comes in, goes over to Joe or whoever I have handling the printing side of things.

[00:30:10] **mytpix LLC**: And then I just, and then I'm done with my part.

[00:30:17] **mytpix LLC**: You know what I mean?

[00:30:17] **mytpix LLC**: Now I got my team on it.

[00:30:18] **mytpix LLC**: Like right now I am the team.

[00:30:19] **mytpix LLC**: And so everything that gets done, I got to do it and I can't do it anymore.

[00:30:25] **Chris Andrade**: This is why you need a transformation in your website.

[00:30:29] **Chris Andrade**: And I mean, it looks like not only there's just things that we just need to kind of just hone in.

[00:30:35] **Chris Andrade**: Right.

[00:30:36] **Chris Andrade**: And check this out.

[00:30:37] **mytpix LLC**: I mean, I'm sorry.

[00:30:38] **mytpix LLC**: I'm so excited.

[00:30:39] **mytpix LLC**: But like, now that I've got Joe on the back end working with me and I'm doing my thing and Joe's, he's really good.

[00:30:46] **mytpix LLC**: Like he really is a good resource.

[00:30:49] **mytpix LLC**: Like the best thing that's coming along in my service part of it.

[00:30:53] **mytpix LLC**: But like, now that I have him, like I can knock out five calls in a day by myself, but I'm going to go.

[00:31:00] **mytpix LLC**: So one hour at a time at each place, maybe not even that long, maybe 45 minutes, maybe just try and milk it to an hour because I got to get to the next place and the next place and the next place because if I don't get all five of those today, I might have five tomorrow and now I got seven and I can't do it.

[00:31:14] **mytpix LLC**: You know, now I got Joe, so I can take five calls and I can turn five hours into 10 hours because and not and not not that I'm scamming the people or anything like that, but there's a difference.

[00:31:26] **mytpix LLC**: Like I've got experience.

[00:31:29] **mytpix LLC**: If I walk in there, I'm going to I already seen the problem.

[00:31:31] **Chris Andrade**: I already know the problem before I got there.

[00:31:33] **mytpix LLC**: And when I and if I don't, I know it within five minutes of getting there.

[00:31:36] **mytpix LLC**: Well, that's how mechanics make their money.

[00:31:38] **mytpix LLC**: I mean, at the end of the day, it's not it's ethical, but I know.

[00:31:42] **mytpix LLC**: And but but the thing is, like, if I already know what the problem is and everything, then I'm going to go.

[00:31:47] **mytpix LLC**: I'm going to be like, Joe, you go.

[00:31:48] **mytpix LLC**: And this is what you need to look out for.

[00:31:49] **mytpix LLC**: if I know of a situation like I had him go do a belt yesterday and I was like, you know what, that belt, there's an issue.

[00:31:54] **mytpix LLC**: Like there's a situation in that belt that if he doesn't pay attention, he's going to ruin the carriage.

[00:31:58] **mytpix LLC**: And so I said, you know what?

[00:31:59] **mytpix LLC**: else's decision.

[00:32:00] **mytpix LLC**: I called the guy that I told was going to be out there.

[00:32:02] **mytpix LLC**: said, Hey, I'm going to come out there tomorrow instead of today, because I want to go with Joe and I want to do a little training with him.

[00:32:08] **mytpix LLC**: He's like, no problem, dude.

[00:32:09] **mytpix LLC**: So I, you know, I got there and I was running late, but Joe showed up an hour.

[00:32:13] **mytpix LLC**: I got sidetracked with you guys in the parking lot for like 45 minutes.

[00:32:16] **mytpix LLC**: By the time I got there, he had all the covers off the machine.

[00:32:19] **mytpix LLC**: He was billing them.

[00:32:20] **mytpix LLC**: And I got there and he was ready to get to where I needed to show him.

[00:32:23] **mytpix LLC**: So I showed him the stuff.

[00:32:24] **mytpix LLC**: And then I ended up on the phone the whole time I was there, but he was working.

[00:32:27] **mytpix LLC**: And so he built out those two hours and then we both split different directions and we build out more hours because like the call that I would have, could have done in two hours, I spent four hours on it because I didn't have the stress of that.

[00:32:39] **mytpix LLC**: And I was able to, I was able to train the end user and give them a valuable experience.

[00:32:44] **mytpix LLC**: And I saved them $1,200 a year on those contract that they're paying for, for the software they don't know how to use.

[00:32:50] **mytpix LLC**: I mean, like, so there's a lot of value in that.

[00:32:55] **mytpix LLC**: In the relationship building and then like, oh, you know, when I'm.

[00:33:00] **mytpix LLC**: I only went there to replace the printout on a roll-in, but I saw a cutter sitting, I said, hey, what's up with that cutter?

[00:33:05] **mytpix LLC**: And the guy's like, oh, yeah, we use it like this, but we don't know how to make stickers, we don't know how to cut them out of the paper.

[00:33:10] **Chris Andrade**: I'm like, do you want to learn?

[00:33:11] **mytpix LLC**: He's like, well, yeah.

[00:33:12] **mytpix LLC**: I said, okay, well, I'll teach you when we get this figured out.

[00:33:15] **mytpix LLC**: And then we went over there, and it's like, oh, their software's all messed up, and the drivers don't work, and we know how to fix all that stuff, but it takes time, you know?

[00:33:25] **mytpix LLC**: But I, but either way, all I'm saying is the slower, the less stressed out that I am, and not dealing with all this background stuff, the full time I can focus on the customer, and then while I'm at the customer, I can look around in the parking lot and be like, who else is here that's in this parking lot?

[00:33:39] **mytpix LLC**: Because there's a shitload of them.

[00:33:41] **mytpix LLC**: If you go to like an architecture place, there's a bunch of other architects and engineers in the building.

[00:33:45] **mytpix LLC**: Just, I would love- Yeah, so this is where it all comes down to the lead funnel, right?

[00:33:50] **mytpix LLC**: I love walking into places when I see them around, or even when I'm at the customers, I'll be like, hey, who else might have a plotter in your neighborhood here?

[00:33:59] **Chris Andrade**: Oh, look.

[00:34:00] **mytpix LLC**: Maybe those guys, those guys, okay.

[00:34:02] **mytpix LLC**: So I'll go over there.

[00:34:03] **mytpix LLC**: But what happens is I get too busy.

[00:34:05] **mytpix LLC**: And then on my way into the call, I'll see like a, I'll see a print shop on the side of the road.

[00:34:09] **mytpix LLC**: And I'll be like, oh .

[00:34:10] **mytpix LLC**: Like yesterday, I saw this guy in the tinting car, dude.

[00:34:13] **mytpix LLC**: And I was like, I pulled up behind him and I started fouling his number while I was in the downtown.

[00:34:17] **mytpix LLC**: And I, I, I, I, I was supposed to turn left and I went straight because he pulled away and I had the first six digits and then he stopped at a light and I got the last four and I hit talk and I made a U-turn and he picked up the phone and he goes, he started speaking to me in Spanish.

[00:34:32] **mytpix LLC**: He's like, I said, I, I said, I see you tint windows.

[00:34:34] **Chris Andrade**: Yeah.

[00:34:34] **Chris Andrade**: Yeah.

[00:34:35] **Chris Andrade**: Yeah.

[00:34:35] **Chris Andrade**: He's like, I, I go, do you have a cutter?

[00:34:37] **mytpix LLC**: He's like, no, I cut my hand.

[00:34:38] **mytpix LLC**: He's like, my wife speak English better.

[00:34:40] **mytpix LLC**: Can you call me later?

[00:34:41] **mytpix LLC**: I said, I got a Hispanic speaking dude, Joe, man, that guy was born in Mexico.

[00:34:46] **mytpix LLC**: And so I sent the lead to Joe and I said, Joe called this dude and speak to him in Spanish for me.

[00:34:51] **mytpix LLC**: Cause I can't communicate with him.

[00:34:53] **mytpix LLC**: And I dropped the ball at that point.

[00:34:54] **mytpix LLC**: don't even know what happened.

[00:34:55] **mytpix LLC**: don't know if Joe actually did it.

[00:34:57] **mytpix LLC**: I don't know if him in the system.

[00:34:59] **Chris Andrade**: Like I could have just,

[00:35:00] **mytpix LLC**: I a picture of the back of the car, and I should have just snapped a picture and then said, make an opportunity out of this, and we'll call it later.

[00:35:06] **Chris Andrade**: So I'm just going to be your teacher here because you paid me to consult you.

[00:35:10] **Chris Andrade**: I'm just going to say, we've been wanting to get some media stuff, and you and Joe showing up to do that belt repair would have been a perfect opportunity for me to come in with my camera and the media stuff to help you on that side of the things, too.

[00:35:25] **Chris Andrade**: Oh, I know.

[00:35:26] **Chris Andrade**: Trust me, dude.

[00:35:27] **Chris Andrade**: I know.

[00:35:28] **mytpix LLC**: It's just like right now, I don't.

[00:35:30] **mytpix LLC**: I can't.

[00:35:31] **mytpix LLC**: I can't do it right now because I was, I know, and I want to let you know, I have a meeting with Joe.

[00:35:40] **Chris Andrade**: I think I need to start getting closer, working closer with Joe, if you're okay with that.

[00:35:46] **Chris Andrade**: I'm fine with it, but I can tell you the videos that I want to make.

[00:35:50] **mytpix LLC**: One of them is going to be a graphtech training, a graphtech.

[00:35:52] **mytpix LLC**: I want to make a bunch of graphtech videos.

[00:35:54] **mytpix LLC**: When do you want, we just need to schedule it out, right?

[00:35:57] **Chris Andrade**: We just need to schedule it out.

[00:35:58] **Chris Andrade**: And I just...

[00:36:00] **mytpix LLC**: The next time that I have a Graftek service call coming up that's not pressing or something, like where they're having a quality issue or something, I'll, well, let's make a video.

[00:36:08] **mytpix LLC**: I'll talk to the person and be like, hey, do you mind if I film it?

[00:36:11] **mytpix LLC**: Yeah, that's perfect.

[00:36:12] **Matthew Kerns**: Yeah, that'd be great.

[00:36:13] **Matthew Kerns**: Exactly.

[00:36:14] **Matthew Kerns**: What I'm hearing, too, is like your business is about to be growing, like more leads are going to be coming in.

[00:36:21] **Matthew Kerns**: So the sooner we can get ahead of the hiring and training employees, the better, the more or less painful it'll be overall, because.

[00:36:31] **Chris Andrade**: And then same for you, Andrew, there's something I wanted to talk to you about.

[00:36:36] **Chris Andrade**: Is there something that we can do with Alyssa to make your, her workflow better with you to make things more efficient with Andrew?

[00:36:49] **Customer Service**: Yeah, I guess I have to get in and figure out what, you know, how, how, how roles get delegated and then once I have a better.

[00:37:03] **Chris Andrade**: So we've been finding very helpful that when you have an idea, you can go to our WhatsApp, we can just add you into the Plotter Mechanics channel, and then we can, what I have Kelsey do is, he can just hit voice record and turn his microphone on, and go ahead, Matthew.

[00:37:30] **Matthew Kerns**: Sorry, didn't want to interrupt, but I have a question about what do you guys, what are we thinking about Ply?

[00:37:41] **Matthew Kerns**: Like, does Andrew, do you like Ply?

[00:37:45] **Matthew Kerns**: Have you heard of, have you guys talked about it yet?

[00:37:48] **Matthew Kerns**: No, I haven't talked to Andrew about it.

[00:37:50] **mytpix LLC**: Andrew, how do you keep track of your inventory?

[00:37:53] **Customer Service**: Well, before I was doing it through Amazon, so I was doing the inventory that way.

[00:37:59] **Customer Service**: I was talk I'll

[00:38:00] **Customer Service**: But now that now that I'm not really doing as much business on there, I, you know, I just have to figure out migrating to the next thing.

[00:38:10] **Customer Service**: I mean, part of it is I'm not doing as much.

[00:38:13] **Customer Service**: I mean, one of my direct clients, you know, they're ordering, you know, a couple sets.

[00:38:19] **Customer Service**: I kind of have a good pulse about like, OK, I need to have this much inventory to kind of, you know, and you're the only one grabbing the inventory off the shelf.

[00:38:28] **mytpix LLC**: That's the problem I'm having is I have other people.

[00:38:31] **Customer Service**: I already I already kind of it's all kind of in my head, which is not the best way to do it.

[00:38:35] **Customer Service**: But I'm saying like, I kind of have a good it.

[00:38:38] **Customer Service**: It's kind of more of an art than a science as far as with me, because it's like I have to I have to anticipate what people need.

[00:38:47] **Customer Service**: And, you know, people go, oh, I need four of these.

[00:38:49] **Customer Service**: And I'm like, who would have ever expected somebody to order four of these?

[00:38:52] **Customer Service**: You know, so.

[00:38:53] **Customer Service**: Right.

[00:38:54] **Customer Service**: When you need help with that, we will be here when you're ready.

[00:38:58] **Chris Andrade**: OK.

[00:39:00] **Chris Andrade**: Kelsey, what's your, what made you guys choose Ply?

[00:39:04] **Chris Andrade**: What again, what was the overall?

[00:39:07] **mytpix LLC**: Well, because my sister-in-law has time to do research and she's researched every option that's out there and that seems like the most feasible one that's available that integrates with Ply.

[00:39:16] **Chris Andrade**: From what we did our research, Matthew and Trent, they agree, right?

[00:39:21] **Chris Andrade**: Yeah.

[00:39:21] **Chris Andrade**: So, and, and I think Matthew is saying that in order to streamline that, is there ideas you had, Matthew?

[00:39:31] **Matthew Kerns**: Well, so, yeah, I mean, I think that, you know, Megan is great.

[00:39:37] **Matthew Kerns**: She found Jobber and Jobber has really helped you guys a lot.

[00:39:40] **Matthew Kerns**: And, but since Andrew is so close, is like basically the expert on the inventory and supply side, I just really want to know what, what Andrew thinks about Ply.

[00:39:53] **Matthew Kerns**: And because he might see, he's going to see stuff that we don't see.

[00:39:58] **Matthew Kerns**: So he might be like, oh, this is.

[00:40:05] **mytpix LLC**: I don't think another one, I think more or less, we don't want to change Ply because they already spent a lot of time and money in it already, so it looks like Ply's addressing, I watched it, I did a demo and then I've watched videos about it, Ply addresses all the problems we're having, it does the label printing, we can do barcodes, we can do RNAs, we can do We can do group proposal, like request for pricing, we can establish like, you know, preferred vendors for products, and we can tie the purchase order to the job so that we know, like if we don't know the job, we know the PO, and then we can find the job that it goes to, and then it's going to help us keep track of our costs, so everything that I'm struggling with, it seems to be addressing, and

[00:41:00] **mytpix LLC**: It seems to me like the owner of the company is making YouTube videos with no crew or anything, dude.

[00:41:05] **mytpix LLC**: He's just going out and like setting up his camera and teaching you how to do it.

[00:41:11] **mytpix LLC**: And they're changing, they're new, like, and I've seen the evolution of Jobber just in the last year and they keep addressing all kinds of different things they didn't have before all over.

[00:41:21] **mytpix LLC**: And sometimes they put tools in there that I'm not even, I don't even see it.

[00:41:25] **mytpix LLC**: You know, I don't even, I'm not looking for it and it's there and I don't even know.

[00:41:29] **mytpix LLC**: So when you, I don't, I think it would be wise.

[00:41:33] **Chris Andrade**: I'm assuming, I don't know how your guys, how you work with Alyssa, but is if there's, when you do interact with her and there are opportunities like, dang, if I can show her how to just do this and then have something ready for you, or I don't know how that, whatever that looks like, I'm trying to find ways to help Alyssa create her SOPs and, and, um, Thank you.

[00:41:59] **Chris Andrade**: you.

[00:42:00] **Chris Andrade**: A flow, like get her on a flow that is more efficient and stick to that routine.

[00:42:09] **Chris Andrade**: So we, I mean, I'm the worst man.

[00:42:12] **Chris Andrade**: I'm the worst one to cause chaos.

[00:42:15] **Chris Andrade**: Well, I'm trying to just create stability, right.

[00:42:20] **Chris Andrade**: By repeatable practices, like, like every morning should be the same morning.

[00:42:27] **Chris Andrade**: And then if a contingency happens, it should be factored in every day, right.

[00:42:32] **Chris Andrade**: We don't have that.

[00:42:33] **Chris Andrade**: We don't have, I need that in my own life, dude.

[00:42:35] **Chris Andrade**: Well, that's why we are building our own time management system.

[00:42:39] **Chris Andrade**: Like you're, like I told you before, you're either in maker mode or manager mode.

[00:42:43] **Chris Andrade**: One of the two every day.

[00:42:45] **Chris Andrade**: And, and, and it gives you clarity when you are able to put things in two bins.

[00:42:50] **Chris Andrade**: So that's ultimately how we operate as our, our group and our, and how we have to like keep all of our  organized.

[00:42:59] **Chris Andrade**: Nice.

[00:43:00] **Chris Andrade**: And so it's just, we feel like my mom's going to be doing the same thing, her business, because clarity gives you peace.

[00:43:13] **Chris Andrade**: And at the end of the day, Kelsey, like, it's just so chaotic.

[00:43:19] **Chris Andrade**: And we're just trying to leave.

[00:43:20] **Chris Andrade**: And like you said, you, you're spiritually been awakened, which I need to go to this church.

[00:43:25] **Chris Andrade**: need to go there.

[00:43:26] **Chris Andrade**: I don't know if it's available tomorrow morning.

[00:43:29] **Chris Andrade**: I'll be there tomorrow morning at 6am.

[00:43:33] **Chris Andrade**: Send me the address.

[00:43:35] **Chris Andrade**: I'll be there tomorrow morning.

[00:43:37] **Chris Andrade**: But I'm saying, I'm saying that you need, well, this is where Andrew, he needs someone like you to kind of define what that needs to look like.

[00:43:50] **Chris Andrade**: And then we are here to help you interpret it, to implement it, to make sure it's successful.

[00:43:56] **Chris Andrade**: So any effort you are putting to the table, we are 10xing it.

[00:44:00] **Chris Andrade**: You understand?

[00:44:01] **Customer Service**: Yeah, I mean, I think the ultimate, I think where we start as far as with Kelsey is if he's getting in front of five clients a day and he's coming in with a cape and saving them, that's our best opportunity to monetize that by either putting them in a service contract or selling them supplies.

[00:44:21] **Customer Service**: And how many times do those service contracts go a year typically?

[00:44:25] **Chris Andrade**: Is it like quarterly, twice a quarter?

[00:44:28] **Chris Andrade**: Well, we have to look at it.

[00:44:31] **Chris Andrade**: It's different individually, you know, like I'm not going to sell PK.

[00:44:36] **Chris Andrade**: So like a matrix involved.

[00:44:38] **Chris Andrade**: There's a matrix that needs to be implemented.

[00:44:40] **Chris Andrade**: Like, so when you're talking about your contacts earlier, because it seems like your contacts and job is all .

[00:44:46] **Chris Andrade**: Yeah.

[00:44:46] **Chris Andrade**: Hey, Kelsey.

[00:44:47] **Chris Andrade**: Yeah.

[00:44:48] **Customer Service**: Sorry to interrupt you, but sorry.

[00:44:50] **Customer Service**: I, this has to come out of my brain before I fall.

[00:44:53] **Customer Service**: Dude, I love it.

[00:44:54] **Customer Service**: I love it.

[00:44:55] **Customer Service**: And Kelsey, you know, the thing that I think is interesting is, you know, people were is

[00:45:00] **Customer Service**: They're these huge contracts, you know, they're selling, you know, for $1,800 or whatever, you know, $3,000.

[00:45:08] **mytpix LLC**: And people are just going, what the hell?

[00:45:10] **Customer Service**: Like, I don't want to come up with $3,000.

[00:45:13] **Customer Service**: All I got to do is show it on my invoice from the last customer I fixed.

[00:45:16] **Customer Service**: Well, what I was going to say is maybe what you should say is, hey, you guys should just go on like, okay, so for my Tesla, you know, if you want full self-driving, it's like eight grand.

[00:45:29] **Customer Service**: And everybody goes, oh, this is crazy.

[00:45:32] **Chris Andrade**: Eight grand?

[00:45:32] **Customer Service**: Like, don't even know if I'm going to have the card for that long.

[00:45:34] **Customer Service**: Or you can pay $99 a month, $99 a month.

[00:45:38] **Customer Service**: And it just, it gives, and people just, that's enough money that they don't really care, but it builds this annuity and this recurring revenue that just seems like not a lot of money, but it's actually more money than if you sell them some huge chunk up front.

[00:45:52] **Customer Service**: So what I was going to say is, why don't you try to set up that same thing where you say, hey, you know what?

[00:45:58] **Customer Service**: Just for me to drive.

[00:46:00] **Customer Service**: I've here is going to cost more than, you know, this amount of money.

[00:46:04] **Customer Service**: You should just do a service contract.

[00:46:05] **Customer Service**: A lot of guys will try to sell you some huge package that's, you know, multi-year.

[00:46:10] **Customer Service**: You should just do some simple thing.

[00:46:12] **Customer Service**: You know, it's, you know, whatever, how much a month.

[00:46:15] **Customer Service**: And it gives you access to basically have us come and fix any problems you have.

[00:46:21] **Customer Service**: Unless it gives me an out if it turns into a  show.

[00:46:26] **mytpix LLC**: Right.

[00:46:26] **mytpix LLC**: Yeah.

[00:46:27] **Customer Service**: Like you can cancel on them if they're annoying or something.

[00:46:29] **Customer Service**: I don't know.

[00:46:30] **Customer Service**: Yeah.

[00:46:30] **mytpix LLC**: But if I sell it to them for $3,000 and then they turn into  and I'm, I'm, I'm over there kissing their  all day long and not getting something else done.

[00:46:37] **mytpix LLC**: And I don't like that either.

[00:46:38] **mytpix LLC**: You know, and that's the thing I, when I was trying to say earlier about it matters is like PK associates, they buy all their supplies, all their ink.

[00:46:46] **mytpix LLC**: And they call me every time their printer breaks.

[00:46:48] **mytpix LLC**: And I charge them by the hour because their printer has 1.25 million square feet on it.

[00:46:53] **mytpix LLC**: I'm not putting a contract on that.

[00:46:54] **mytpix LLC**: Right.

[00:46:54] **mytpix LLC**: You know what I mean?

[00:46:56] **mytpix LLC**: right.

[00:46:56] **mytpix LLC**: That's like a machine, but they don't want to buy a new machine.

[00:46:58] **mytpix LLC**: I tried to sell them new machines.

[00:47:00] **mytpix LLC**: They're like, no, we got your number and you can fix this .

[00:47:02] **mytpix LLC**: We're not spending $10,000.

[00:47:03] **mytpix LLC**: We'd rather spend $500 a month on this thing.

[00:47:05] **mytpix LLC**: How do you fix it?

[00:47:07] **mytpix LLC**: You brought up a point real quick.

[00:47:11] **Chris Andrade**: How do you guys keep track of the printers?

[00:47:13] **Chris Andrade**: Because you always tell me that, how many feet they print.

[00:47:17] **Chris Andrade**: And how do you guys keep track of that, ultimately?

[00:47:19] **Chris Andrade**: We don't keep track of any of it, dude.

[00:47:22] **mytpix LLC**: We don't keep track.

[00:47:23] **mytpix LLC**: Should you be keeping track of that?

[00:47:26] **mytpix LLC**: I should have been keeping track of it for the last five years, but I don't have a place to put it.

[00:47:32] **Chris Andrade**: Yeah, I need to know the customer's serial number.

[00:47:35] **Chris Andrade**: So when you were talking earlier with Trent about the contact situation through Jobber, and all your contacts are .

[00:47:43] **Chris Andrade**: So it looks like we have to go through and understand what contact needs to get copied and paid.

[00:47:50] **Chris Andrade**: We have to go through and go through your contacts, right?

[00:47:53] **Chris Andrade**: Yeah.

[00:47:54] **Chris Andrade**: What if we create this contact and your CRM that's just-

[00:48:00] **Chris Andrade**: Clean this up, and then start building out that repository needed to keep track of all your clients'  serial numbers, your maintenance schedule, because if you're trying to turn on something and you don't have, ultimately, your  already organized, it's going to create a huge issue, right?

[00:48:18] **mytpix LLC**: Well, I think that what I could do is I can, every time we do a service call, we should go straight to the printer's serial number tag, and it has the information.

[00:48:26] **Chris Andrade**: Yeah, and then we can put that into your own chat, and then that will take the picture, scrub, get the information, put it in your CRM, but we got to build the CRM in order to do it.

[00:48:41] **Chris Andrade**: And all that is, it's just a spreadsheet.

[00:48:42] **Chris Andrade**: don't know if Matthew is available to talk on that, but it shouldn't be crazy hard to build a CRM.

[00:48:50] **Matthew Kerns**: Yeah, we don't want to build a CRM from the bottom up, we want to integrate an existing one.

[00:48:55] **Chris Andrade**: Exactly, that's what I meant to say.

[00:48:57] **Chris Andrade**: And you already have capsules, so I don't know, we need to...

[00:49:00] **Matthew Kerns**: So just figure out, do we reuse that or do we use a new one?

[00:49:03] **Chris Andrade**: This is going to be that phase two rollout, Matthew.

[00:49:07] **Chris Andrade**: We're going to have to put this in part of the phase two rollout.

[00:49:10] **Chris Andrade**: For sure.

[00:49:11] **Chris Andrade**: I understand that's a totally separate situation.

[00:49:13] **mytpix LLC**: But I think that a capsule is meant for people like you and jobber is meant for people like me.

[00:49:20] **mytpix LLC**: It's way too complicated for me to comprehend.

[00:49:23] **mytpix LLC**: I mean, it's deep, dude.

[00:49:25] **mytpix LLC**: Yeah.

[00:49:27] **Chris Andrade**: And that's, so I know, man, Andrew, I think we could keep going on and on.

[00:49:32] **Chris Andrade**: And I think you gave us some really good bread.

[00:49:34] **Chris Andrade**: And I think, Matthew, let's add Andrew to the WhatsApp channel.

[00:49:38] **Chris Andrade**: And like was just saying, Andrew, if there's an idea or something, you see you with Alyssa, I'm like, hey, guys, is there a way we can teach Alyssa how to create this project or task in this?

[00:49:52] **Chris Andrade**: And then like we can create a video, a loom, an SOP, a flowchart, the whole nine.

[00:49:59] **mytpix LLC**: Bye.

[00:49:59] **mytpix LLC**: Bye.

[00:49:59] **mytpix LLC**: Bye.

[00:50:00] **Matthew Kerns**: And something else is also, like, we've started mapping out the internal operations, and Andrew said that he wants to understand how that all works, so we've got to send that over to you, Andrew, also.

[00:50:13] **Matthew Kerns**: Right.

[00:50:14] **Chris Andrade**: So, yeah, we're systematically going through it all, and I plan on going over there Tuesday, Kelsey, if we can want to meet up in the morning, I can get there earlier.

[00:50:29] **Chris Andrade**: Yeah, that's fine.

[00:50:30] **Chris Andrade**: Just put it on the schedule.

[00:50:32] **Chris Andrade**: Well, you know what?

[00:50:33] **mytpix LLC**: Yeah, let's do it now.

[00:50:34] **mytpix LLC**: I'm going to have to go on a road trip later next week.

[00:50:37] **mytpix LLC**: I've to go to Tucson for two service calls, and I've to go to Pinetop, so I'm probably going to do, like, a Thursday, Tucson, Friday, Pinetop, and then hit the lake on my way home, so I'd say Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, I'll be in town, but I'm going to have to hit the road.

[00:50:50] **Chris Andrade**: Yeah, I want to get with Joe and possibly Alyssa on Tuesday, and so, yeah, and I do need to talk to you.

[00:51:02] **Chris Andrade**: I'm going to at the office today.

[00:51:05] **mytpix LLC**: I'm not leaving here today.

[00:51:06] **mytpix LLC**: I've a lot of things I need to figure out for next week and get on board and stuff, and I'm tired.

[00:51:12] **mytpix LLC**: I've got a question real quick.

[00:51:17] **Matthew Kerns**: We're going to be working on the trainings and SOPs, but I think the hiring funnel is something that I want to get a hold of, too.

[00:51:25] **Matthew Kerns**: It's like, Kelsey, you have all these warm contacts and people you might have in mind for technicians to hire, I think.

[00:51:34] **Matthew Kerns**: Maybe not a lot right now.

[00:51:35] **mytpix LLC**: So you know that guy, Steve, that I just told you went and grabbed a printhead?

[00:51:40] **mytpix LLC**: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

[00:51:41] **mytpix LLC**: It works for Thomas Reprographics.

[00:51:44] **mytpix LLC**: He's making like, he told me what he's making, 30 bucks an hour right now, and he's doing everything.

[00:51:52] **mytpix LLC**: He's running the supplies, he's running the service, he's running the sales, and all they ever do is call him and tell him, hey, man, this

[00:52:00] **mytpix LLC**: Customers got a problem.

[00:52:02] **mytpix LLC**: And like, you know, like they don't see anything that he's doing good.

[00:52:06] **mytpix LLC**: And he's a badass tech, dude.

[00:52:07] **mytpix LLC**: He knows Roland's, he knows all these different machines.

[00:52:10] **mytpix LLC**: And ideally, if you want to talk about a hiring funnel, I'd want to hire somebody that knows what the F they're doing, dude.

[00:52:15] **mytpix LLC**: Like, I don't want to hire another person and train them.

[00:52:17] **mytpix LLC**: Like that guy knows how to do page wide design jet, Canon, Roland, you know, supplies.

[00:52:24] **Matthew Kerns**: Yeah.

[00:52:25] **Chris Andrade**: And you got to justify his costs to make sure he's at least.

[00:52:28] **Chris Andrade**: Yeah.

[00:52:29] **Chris Andrade**: Okay.

[00:52:29] **Chris Andrade**: Okay.

[00:52:30] **mytpix LLC**: Well, once, once I start generating revenue, like, honestly, like the other thing that we're left on the table is like annual maintenance followups.

[00:52:37] **mytpix LLC**: Like we should be hitting people up and we can automate that later, but Hey, six months later, just, Hey, how's your machine doing?

[00:52:42] **mytpix LLC**: You know, we haven't heard from you.

[00:52:43] **mytpix LLC**: You know, if we haven't heard from, we won't send it, but otherwise a year later, it's like, Hey, we need to schedule your annual preventative maintenance call.

[00:52:51] **mytpix LLC**: When would you like to do it?

[00:52:52] **mytpix LLC**: Like, don't ask them if they're They it.

[00:52:54] **mytpix LLC**: Just say, it's time to do it because they need to be educated, dude.

[00:52:57] **mytpix LLC**: Like if nobody told me to change an oil in their car.

[00:53:00] **mytpix LLC**: Or you would never change it.

[00:53:01] **mytpix LLC**: Like a chick would just drive it until the engine fell out.

[00:53:03] **Chris Andrade**: So if you were to give Steve an offer to come over with, and then you have to like juice it up, right?

[00:53:14] **Chris Andrade**: Why does he want to go with you?

[00:53:16] **Chris Andrade**: Well, if you give him stake in the company or the growth of what you're trying to do, right?

[00:53:23] **Chris Andrade**: I would love that.

[00:53:24] **Chris Andrade**: Yeah, so I have a whole program geared for that, bro.

[00:53:29] **Chris Andrade**: So I would really try to incentivize and encourage, because at the end of the day, a business is most best asset is it's people, it's people.

[00:53:39] **Chris Andrade**: You have to encourage that to come to you.

[00:53:42] **Chris Andrade**: Why do you, why do you, why do people want to go to you to work, you know?

[00:53:48] **mytpix LLC**: I mean, I basically want everybody that participates in this situation to be benefiting from it, because that's the only reason I ever, that's the only reason I'm talking to you guys right now.

[00:54:00] **mytpix LLC**: Like, never told you this, but I had a boss back at the CAD store years ago, and she let me do my own thing, but she rewarded me by my performance, and she did it so much that I felt guilty when I got my paychecks.

[00:54:12] **mytpix LLC**: And I was, I didn't, nobody had to tell me to do , man.

[00:54:18] **mytpix LLC**: I came in more, I came in before anybody showed up, I had my suit in line, I had a secretary that was getting my stuff ready throughout the day, I'd come back in the evening, I'd put everything away, and I'd go again.

[00:54:28] **mytpix LLC**: And I haven't had that piece since I left that company, dude.

[00:54:32] **mytpix LLC**: Plotter Doctors was never that way, this has never been that way, but I see the light at end of the tunnel now, to where I could get back to where I could, I could at least feel like I completed what I was supposed to do.

[00:54:43] **mytpix LLC**: Yeah, exactly.

[00:54:45] **mytpix LLC**: I don't have, I never feel that way.

[00:54:47] **mytpix LLC**: I just, when I get done with the day, I feel like I got done with what I needed to take care of with my customers, and now I got no more energy from my wife, my kids, my, and all the other things that I have to run my business.

[00:54:57] **Chris Andrade**: And I got plenty of money, dude.

[00:54:59] **Chris Andrade**: got plenty of money.

[00:55:00] **mytpix LLC**: I'm not paying myself hardly  right now, but I have no peace and no time, so that's where we're at.

[00:55:07] **Matthew Kerns**: And someone like Steve can, I mean, if he knows his stuff, like, he can basically, we can have him be, like, the training videos and stuff can be led by his knowledge instead of yourself.

[00:55:24] **mytpix LLC**: No, I'm going to be the videographer.

[00:55:30] **Chris Andrade**: I think what you're trying to do is if Steve was able to replace you to create the office, the service program, right, and have him just focus on just the service side of things, and then that will allow you, it will free up Kelsey to focus on the business.

[00:55:53] **Chris Andrade**: So you're now working on the business and not in the business.

[00:55:58] **Chris Andrade**: So I think...

[00:56:00] **Chris Andrade**: So I honestly think, Kelsey, I would have a serious conversation with Nikki and see what that looks like.

[00:56:08] **Chris Andrade**: Because paint the picture, bro.

[00:56:10] **Chris Andrade**: If you are able to get a technician to turn the company and actually be managed the way it needs to be, and then all you have to do now is just show up when you need to and then build the business the way you want to, it's a-win situation.

[00:56:27] **mytpix LLC**: If have a technician on the back end that could handle a majority of the regular service calls, then I could say, okay, I want to take on this new customers, just the new ones.

[00:56:37] **mytpix LLC**: And I want to go put the first impression and then I'll follow up with the supplies thing and all that.

[00:56:42] **mytpix LLC**: Me and Andrew work on that part of it.

[00:56:44] **mytpix LLC**: I plant the seed.

[00:56:45] **mytpix LLC**: And then from there forward, I back off of it and I let you guys deal with it.

[00:56:50] **mytpix LLC**: You know, I would be more than happy to get up every morning and go out and hit up every architect, engineer, construction company.

[00:56:59] **mytpix LLC**: you, Leslie.

[00:57:05] **Chris Andrade**: I'll go with you, man.

[00:57:06] **Chris Andrade**: We'll go  tag team .

[00:57:08] **Chris Andrade**: Like, listen, I believe in it, too.

[00:57:10] **Chris Andrade**: Like, I love it.

[00:57:14] **Chris Andrade**: Yeah, exactly, dude.

[00:57:16] **Chris Andrade**: That's how I met you.

[00:57:17] **Chris Andrade**: Right.

[00:57:18] **Chris Andrade**: And so I know what you're talking.

[00:57:21] **Chris Andrade**: And I guess what I'm trying to say here is I think, honestly, this Steve guy might be your quickest ticket to freedom, dude.

[00:57:30] **Chris Andrade**: Like, ultimately, like, helping you alleviate the office and boost, like, because you're in your business.

[00:57:37] **Chris Andrade**: You're not on your business.

[00:57:38] **Chris Andrade**: And there's two different, like, there's, I know.

[00:57:42] **Chris Andrade**: And if he can give you that, it would be worth it.

[00:57:45] **Matthew Kerns**: Oh, yeah, exactly.

[00:57:47] **Matthew Kerns**: I'm curious about the what, at what point does somebody become a stakeholder versus you paying him hourly as a technician?

[00:57:58] **Matthew Kerns**: Because you mentioned he's Yeah.

[00:58:01] **Matthew Kerns**: I would bring him in as the service manager.

[00:58:05] **Matthew Kerns**: He would become the service manager under my guidance.

[00:58:10] **mytpix LLC**: He would have that title and he would get paid for the performance of service, which he doesn't get paid on right now.

[00:58:19] **mytpix LLC**: He just gets paid the same  no matter what he does.

[00:58:23] **mytpix LLC**: And if he brings in a sale for a brand new printer, he doesn't get commissioned on it.

[00:58:27] **mytpix LLC**: He doesn't get nothing from it.

[00:58:28] **mytpix LLC**: He gets to install it.

[00:58:30] **mytpix LLC**: Which, you know, that's part of the part that would go towards service.

[00:58:33] **mytpix LLC**: The installation and setup of the printer is going to go towards the service income, but the equipment sale is going to go towards the equipment sale that Andrew sold.

[00:58:41] **mytpix LLC**: Like, Andrew, he closed it.

[00:58:43] **mytpix LLC**: He sold it.

[00:58:43] **mytpix LLC**: He helped me develop the program.

[00:58:44] **mytpix LLC**: He's getting a piece of the pie.

[00:58:47] **mytpix LLC**: Yeah, so the incentive lines up with the role.

[00:58:50] **Matthew Kerns**: Does that make sense?

[00:58:52] **mytpix LLC**: Yeah, so Andrew would be getting directly rewarded for the performance and he's managing the purchasing side of it.

[00:58:59] **mytpix LLC**: So, so

[00:59:00] **mytpix LLC**: I can't replace them.

[00:59:02] **mytpix LLC**: I can't go out and get another Andrew that knows how to source parts all over the world and bring them in and maximize every opportunity.

[00:59:10] **mytpix LLC**: I mean, I'm not saying I can't, but I don't know who they are, and I doubt I'm going to have a 20-year history of knowing them.

[00:59:22] **Customer Service**: Yeah, it does seem like my skill set in your job and your business is uniquely suited to kind of be key and slot.

[00:59:35] **Customer Service**: I mean, I was telling my wife, I didn't see it coming, but it does make a lot of sense, and it's like a good match.

[00:59:44] **Customer Service**: So, yeah, it's the same feeling as mutual, you know?

[00:59:48] **Customer Service**: Oh, that's so good to hear, too.

[00:59:50] **Customer Service**: That's so good to hear.

[00:59:52] **mytpix LLC**: Yeah, I mean, I see like all of us showing up in Las Vegas at a trade show together, dude.

[00:59:57] **Chris Andrade**: Yeah!

[01:00:00] **Chris Andrade**: Let's go.

[01:00:01] **Chris Andrade**: Let's go.

[01:00:02] **mytpix LLC**: And, you know, studying the industry and figuring out where to go because I'm going to tell you guys what's going to happen is as soon as we start kicking  here, the manufacturers are going to come after us.

[01:00:10] **mytpix LLC**: That's what happened last time.

[01:00:11] **mytpix LLC**: They're going to come after us wanting us to sell their products and .

[01:00:14] **mytpix LLC**: And we're going to be like, nah, we're not really interested in that .

[01:00:17] **mytpix LLC**: You know, like we already got our own niche over here.

[01:00:19] **mytpix LLC**: We're doing fine.

[01:00:19] **mytpix LLC**: We don't need you.

[01:00:20] **mytpix LLC**: We don't need you telling us what to do and all that stuff.

[01:00:22] **mytpix LLC**: But that's why that's how I, you know, in the past, my goal was to become an HP dealer.

[01:00:26] **mytpix LLC**: But when I started my company and I went to HP and the guy treated me like an , I made a vow to never be a dealer for HP again.

[01:00:33] **mytpix LLC**: No .

[01:00:34] **Chris Andrade**: So I don't need to be.

[01:00:36] **mytpix LLC**: We don't need to be.

[01:00:36] **mytpix LLC**: We can be just independents doing what we do and we don't need to bow down to the manufacturers.

[01:00:42] **mytpix LLC**: I want to go out and make videos about how the manufacturers are screwing your customers, actually, if you want to know the truth.

[01:00:47] **Chris Andrade**: Hey, did you know, I just went on YouTube live for the first time yesterday.

[01:00:50] **Chris Andrade**: It was an experience.

[01:00:52] **Chris Andrade**: It was an I don't know how to do any of that stuff, but I want to do it.

[01:00:55] **Chris Andrade**: Like, I want my social media to where I can just pull up in the parking lot and be like, I'm.

[01:01:00] **mytpix LLC**: I'm here at So-and-so Architects.

[01:01:01] **mytpix LLC**: I got this HP printer.

[01:01:03] **mytpix LLC**: It's broken.

[01:01:04] **mytpix LLC**: I'm going to go in here.

[01:01:04] **mytpix LLC**: I'm going to fix it once this.

[01:01:06] **Chris Andrade**: listen, that would be so much fun.

[01:01:09] **Chris Andrade**: It would be a good time.

[01:01:11] **Chris Andrade**: It would be a good time.

[01:01:12] **Chris Andrade**: I'm excited.

[01:01:13] **mytpix LLC**: GrafTech cutters, you know, like, I'm going to go in there.

[01:01:16] **mytpix LLC**: I'm going to say, send a test code over here.

[01:01:17] **mytpix LLC**: And then I'm going to say, now weed that $1,000 roll of material and show me how it works.

[01:01:22] **mytpix LLC**: And they're going to be, like, riffing it up.

[01:01:24] **mytpix LLC**: And then I'm going to get done.

[01:01:25] **mytpix LLC**: And I'm going to try it again now.

[01:01:26] **mytpix LLC**: It's going to come out like butter.

[01:01:27] **mytpix LLC**: And they're going to be like, damn.

[01:01:28] **mytpix LLC**: I'm not going to tell them everything I did to make it happen.

[01:01:31] **mytpix LLC**: I'm just going to give them the gist of it.

[01:01:34] **mytpix LLC**: If they want to pay for the full boat, then we can get them on our service plan on our website where we have access to the full video.

[01:01:41] **mytpix LLC**: But this is just like the before and after effect.

[01:01:44] **mytpix LLC**: Like, you know, see this guy right here?

[01:01:47] **mytpix LLC**: He took the money that he saved last year on Inks, and he bought himself a, you know, new laptop.

[01:01:53] **mytpix LLC**: Or, you know what, all the money I saved the customers, all the money I saved myself last year.

[01:01:59] **mytpix LLC**: to care of as And Even

[01:02:00] **mytpix LLC**: I'm buying OEM products.

[01:02:01] **mytpix LLC**: I just bought this brand new car I'm driving in.

[01:02:04] **mytpix LLC**: Right, right, right.

[01:02:07] **mytpix LLC**: Like, let's keep the money in our pockets and not give it to the hungry pigs in the industry.

[01:02:13] **mytpix LLC**: Wall Street or IRS.

[01:02:15] **Chris Andrade**: Keep it all the way from that.

[01:02:17] **mytpix LLC**: So, you know, I mean, I'm ready to do that, but I'm not going to do it until I'm ready to do it.

[01:02:24] **mytpix LLC**: You know what I mean?

[01:02:24] **mytpix LLC**: But I'm gung ho about it, bro.

[01:02:26] **mytpix LLC**: No, we're working.

[01:02:27] **Chris Andrade**: We're working.

[01:02:28] **Chris Andrade**: Aggregation of marginal gains, man.

[01:02:30] **Chris Andrade**: One percent.

[01:02:31] **Chris Andrade**: That's all we need every day.

[01:02:32] **Chris Andrade**: One percent.

[01:02:34] **Chris Andrade**: Yeah, you know what that means.

[01:02:36] **mytpix LLC**: But yeah, it sounds good.

[01:02:38] **Chris Andrade**: You know what aggregation of marginal gains is?

[01:02:41] **Chris Andrade**: Atomic Habits.

[01:02:42] **Chris Andrade**: Oh, it's a book.

[01:02:42] **Chris Andrade**: I got to get it for you.

[01:02:43] **Chris Andrade**: It's a good one.

[01:02:44] **Chris Andrade**: Hopefully it comes in an audio version.

[01:02:46] **mytpix LLC**: It does.
