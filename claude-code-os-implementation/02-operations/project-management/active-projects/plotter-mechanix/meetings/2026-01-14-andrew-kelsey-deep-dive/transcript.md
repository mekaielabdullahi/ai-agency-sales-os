0:00 - Chris Andrade
because you're on mute. Oh, you're on mute, Andrew.

0:05 - mytpix LLC
Don't worry, we don't know how to use it either. We're figuring out together.

0:13 - Trent Christopher
I don't know, we can't unmute.

0:16 - mytpix LLC
It should be across the bottom of your screen, Andrew, if you can see it, like, a little microphone.

0:20 - Trent Christopher
Yeah, there's a microphone. There we go. All right. Hello. Sorry to wake you up so early, man. didn't know that this was going down this early.

0:30 - mytpix LLC
I was already awake.

0:32 - Chris Andrade
I'm just looking at how old I look.

0:37 - Trent Christopher
I mean, I think I look older than anybody else on the call. So you're okay.

0:44 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
So, yeah, I guess I'll go. My name is Matthew. My background is in software development engineering. So I worked at Amazon for almost seven years. don't what not as I I software development engineer. And then about four years ago, I left that job to start an e-commerce company. So I started using Amazon FBA as a business model to run that new company. So that one, it's still going. There's a lot of issues with cash flow and inventory. Delays and just the cost of the initial purchase was a big part of the problems for me so far, but we're turning it around. But basically this year or this last year, I started getting more into automations and like using AI to build custom software and just automations for things that companies need. So that's how I... Ran into these guys and we started this automation agency together. So I'll hand it off to the other guys, but that's a bit about me. Thank you.

2:11 - Mekaiel Abdullahi
Hey, I'll go next. Hey, my name is Mekaiel. I am 30 years old living in Washington, D.C. My background is in information technology, mostly in the Department of State and Department of Defense. Air Force Vet did systems networking and security engineering for the most part, and then started off taking this AI opportunity early last year. And that's why I met these guys and co-founded Arise Group where we help small businesses and medium sized businesses adopt AI with simplicity and for growth. That's just a little bit about myself and I'll let Trent and Chris go. Yeah, sure. I'll go real quick.

2:54 - Trent Christopher
I know Chris, he's probably got a long winded way of explaining his side of things. I'm 22 years into industrial automation as a controls engineer, automating robots and sensors and doing physical automation and then I just started my own business a year ago and then I met these guys just like Matthew said. So now we're just focused on trying to hammer out AI and automations for businesses to help them out.

3:23 - Chris Andrade
So yeah, I am just ultimately here to help this guy out because, you know, I see so much potential. It's just the systems are so fragmented and everything is like in such silos and me knowing how things work. I know that there's a way to make connections. We just got to establish the processes and the processes in order to create systems to replicate success. And that means value, money. And you guys have this niche for what Kelsey tells me is you have this really good relationship. And we're just trying to ultimately help Kelsey out in general. But if we can also produce what we call money models, and design things to be implemented in strategic ways, to kind of make life a little bit more easier. And we don't have to spend so much time. And if we can make money while we sleep, that's ultimately a good recipe for success. So we're just trying to see how that looks for Kelsey. And how can we help? Because at the end of the day, we get paid by an ROI attachment to whatever key needs, right? That's at the end of the day, how we work.

4:58 - Trent Christopher
So how's it going, Andrew?

5:07 - Chris Andrade
Chris, where do you think you want this to kind of go?

5:12 - mytpix LLC
Well, I mean, I was just talking to Andrew the other day about his Amazon business kind of being halted by them. And, you know, he's kind of like at a place. We've worked together in the past. He knows about my past and he's familiar with my ex-business partner. And I was just sharing. I mean, he does. The only reason we don't work together exclusively is because I sell compatible inks, which he doesn't do. So I don't know if there's, you know, a way that we can work together to promote the compatible ink business, you know, on a bigger scale to where we can, you know, make sales that way or even implement his business strategy into the wide format stuff that we do. Because I can tell you, my customers will have no, have no problems putting an expired ink card in their machine if it's less money and they have a guarantee. can I ruined way more printers with my compatibles than Andrew's ruined with his OEM expired cartridges. And everything he has isn't expired necessarily either, but he logistically knows how to source parts. And as I'm getting busier in service and that, I don't have a person to handle any of that stuff for me, really, besides me personally. And I don't have time to do that because I'm on the road and I'm out, you know, gathering more clients. And so I just, you know, with Andrew's thing going on and with all the stuff that we're working on here, I need somebody that really understands the industry that wants to, you know, profit from putting their investment into it. And I don't want to take nothing from nobody, dude. Like I want it to be like clear and upfront, like, look, this is what I do. This is what you do. Like, I need to have that. Like, I can't be doing everything. And there's a lot that goes on the back end and with the supplies, logistics, shipping, Andrew knows all that stuff. And I don't know any of it. So that's why I brought him into the conversation. And I don't even know if it's feasible or logical to work with it. But I'm just trying to gather all of my resources together so we can just kind of, you know, go through and see what we can do with it. That's awesome, Luke. I just want to add real quick.

7:09 - Mekaiel Abdullahi
If it's okay, I'm going to try switching my Wi-Fi because it keeps getting choppy.

7:14 - Customer Service
Let me let me switch.

7:18 - mytpix LLC
We can even turn off video to reduce.

7:22 - Mekaiel Abdullahi
Yeah, yeah, you can do that, too.

7:25 - Trent Christopher
I don't need to see you guys. Yeah, it'll help.

7:28 - mytpix LLC
Okay, there very front Wi-Fi.

7:31 - Customer Service
Oh, can you guys hear me? Yeah.

7:34 - Mekaiel Abdullahi
A lot better.

7:35 - Customer Service
Sorry, my internet's just acting stupid, so. no worries. We turn off our internet.

7:42 - Mekaiel Abdullahi
Okay, there you are. Do you get us okay? Yeah, my internet was acting stupid, so.

7:50 - Customer Service
Okay, yeah, so I've been selling on, if you guys want to know a little bit about me, I've been selling on Amazon forever. Ever. I mean, I don't know, since the beginning. know. don't know. I don't The problem is, is with Amazon, you know, they've just kind of switched their business model from being kind of the Wild West, to being something that requires brand approval, compliance, you know, you could be getting grandfathered in, but one wrong complaint, and you don't have every receipt, invoice that just is straight from God's mouth, they spit you out. And so, you know, they're just trying to align themselves with the brand holders, and middle people that are selling brand, you know, stuff on not authorized, just get spit out. So, I'm not really looking on putting my business on leased land with Amazon, where it's just sort of indiscriminate, and they can spit you out, unless it's something that I have complete control over, and I'm, you know, like the brand holder or whatever. So, but, as far as with Kelsey goes, you know, he's kind of more focused on the service side, and bringing clients in, and building trust. That's And so I would probably be more encouraged on building off that, where, you know, he creates a direct relationship with a client where when they think of, you know, the plotter, they think of Kelsey and his company. And then, you know, if we could build a network off of that, it, you know, it's one of those things where it's sort of desegregated, where it's not just all at the whims of Amazon being able to take away your birthday. So, I mean, I've done that.

9:33 - mytpix LLC
And I'm kind of just, I'm kind of just over that in this stage of my life.

9:38 - Customer Service
As far as like the AI and building tools and all that stuff, I don't, I, I, I'm receptive to that, but I don't know a ton about that. But as far as like logistics about sorting stuff, you know, sourcing stuff, doing fulfillment, you know, integrating in the software with on the back end, if we had some sort of platform and all that stuff, I know how to do all that. So I'm not worried about that. But, you know, what do you think about AI?

10:07 - mytpix LLC
And what do you think its potential is in business?

10:09 - Customer Service
honestly, yeah, I think it's I think it's like, it's like, you know, 20, you know, 20 years ago, and everybody's like, you just need to have a website and everything's gonna work itself out. I mean, there are things that I mean, it's it's sort of like, I agree that that is a powerful tool. I just don't. It's just kind of a buzzword that might sound good. And everybody gets excited about it. But like, I don't know how to like, I don't know how to like implement it where I'm gonna like actually monetize that. And I also, you know, I think it's, I don't know, these guys angle, so I can't speak to what they're doing. But, you know, it's, I, yeah, I mean, certainly AI is great. But, you know, it's kind of an arms race. And I don't really know how if I'm going to be at the front of the line. So, I think a lot of this is just hard work and not really just giving it to an AI as far as what you want to do, Kelsey, but maybe I'm wrong.

11:12 - Trent Christopher
So something that we are working on is... It's definitely hard work, dude.

11:17 - mytpix LLC
There's no doubt about it.

11:18 - Trent Christopher
Yeah, there's no way around it is that AI can't do everything for you, but the things that AI can help with is making it a little bit easier or a little bit faster or more efficient, or you can do things that you weren't able to do before that are... It's an enabling technology. Now, we're not creating the AI. We're not trying to compete with ChatGPT and create our own AI. What we're doing is implementing AI where it makes sense to improve throughput, revenue, getting client leads, communications, automations on the backside, those... These types of things by leveraging what OpenAI and these other companies are building for pools for us to use and implement. So the idea right now, the perception of AI is exactly what you just described.

12:17 - Chris Andrade
Can you give a synopsis of what we're doing for Kelsey so he understands a little bit? Yeah, yeah.

12:23 - Trent Christopher
So one thing that we're looking at for Kelsey, what we're working on for Kelsey, is a way to streamline communication so that they don't have to do so much manual entry into their systems. There's a communications problem between Kelsey being able to communicate with his clients well and Alyssa as well, his assistant. So Kelsey needs to focus on the service side of things. He needs to be working on the relationships and servicing the plotters and printers and not taking the phone calls unless they are, you know, urgent or So what we're doing is trying to implement a system where we can listen in on the phone calls, and we can automatically take those phone calls, and we can put them into their jobber system automatically, but also making it to where Kelsey and Alyssa, when they have a conversation, the context is collected so that Alyssa doesn't have to make all these phone calls to Kelsey to say, hey, Kelsey, you did something over there, and you talked to client X, what did you guys talk We're trying to make it to where they can focus on what they're good at, what their levers are, and use AI and automation to be able to pull these details out and put them into their systems where they need them closer to the end of the task. They have a task that they need to complete as part of the business process. We're trying to take some of those gaps and fill them in with technology. So that's, that's where we're at. And we've talked to Kelsey about inventory management as future phases, probably the next immediate phase is to be able to track inventory and build integrations with those systems as well.

14:11 - Chris Andrade
And that's when you kind of came in and that's when we started randomly shoot you because Kelsey, know him, he gets all fired up. Yeah. Let's shoot Andrew a text. I'm like, okay, let's shoot him a text.

14:22 - Trent Christopher
So we appreciate your time.

14:25 - Chris Andrade
Oh, yeah. No, I'm interested to be here.

14:30 - Customer Service
Thank you. Yeah.

14:31 - Trent Christopher
So I think the primary reason for this call really was just because Kelsey was explaining to us the potential interest in some sort of joint venture where you could do the supplies and he could do the service side because he already has sort of a partially established supplies division of his business, but he doesn't want to focus on that. He wants someone else to focus on that aspect. Because it's required for maintaining what he does, and he just needs someone else to be able to do that for him.

15:07 - Customer Service
So I guess with us trying to implement things and his interest in having somebody be able to do the supplies, that's why you're doing mean, my thought with Kelsey is, I mean, just if I were to like dream up the most ideal thing, you know, I think you should keep a very lean inventory on his shelf and have me do all the fulfillment. Because his main supplier, I think, is in California, but... Well, my compatible supplier is in California, and honestly, if we did it smart, they could do the fulfillment, and all we'd have to do is just ship labels to them and drop ship everything. Yeah, yeah, I don't know how much harder that is and how... It would be better if you handled it because you have better control, dude.

15:53 - mytpix LLC
You're not relying on somebody else. I mean, that's the end. To me, I hate drop shipping.

16:00 - Customer Service
I hate it because people are so stupid and they do stuff wrong. And it's always just it's like twice as much work, dude.

16:07 - Chris Andrade
We're doing things wrong constantly, bro.

16:09 - mytpix LLC
Like, I mean, I just delivered a box of paper like an hour and a half drive in the car if I was only going to do that. And before I got back, the guy's like, I ordered 30 inch.

16:18 - Chris Andrade
So we're going back and forth.

16:19 - mytpix LLC
Was it 36 or 30? And Alyssa's like, no, he said he wanted 36. He's going through her notes. I'm like, holy , man. Like, this is I only made $20 on this .

16:26 - Chris Andrade
You know what mean?

16:27 - mytpix LLC
Like, I'm like, why did we mess this up, man?

16:31 - Chris Andrade
What makes the inventory like what's the pros and cons versus dropshipping versus just keeping the inventory and shipping it out yourself? Just enlighten me because this something I can enlighten you.

16:44 - mytpix LLC
Because Andrew, what he deals with is, like I said, a lot of expired things and whatever. So he has to physically inspect everything he sells before he delivers it. And so so should we, honestly, like if we're really paying attention to our competitors, before we ship them, we could be. You know, knowing we could have be having a higher success rate. I mean, my success rate is good. But the thing that is the killer of the success is sitting around on the shelf for too long, which I'm notorious for, like, you don't about rotation inventory systems in place to reduce.

17:18 - Chris Andrade
Okay. And then what is it? What's the requirements needed to be able to run something like your MVP minimum viable product? Andrew, what would be the requirements needed for Kelsey to set up something like that?

17:35 - Customer Service
I mean, I think it just start really small, you know, whatever his bread and butter is, start with that. And, you know, get a dip your toe in the water. That look like how it goes, you know, I mean, to me, the thing about drop shipping is that you, you know, your client's not going to put a reorder slip in there, they're not going to put the invoice in there. So it just kind of, it kind of just comes into, you And it's less personal, it kind of also just, you know, there's no invoice or packing slip, you know, you don't want to usually give your, you know, you know, and also, I don't really like giving the, I don't really like giving an untrusted or not. I don't like giving out my, my vendors to just a company, if case, sometimes things get commingled in with their system. Yeah, I just, it's, it just is messy, you know, and also, there's kind of, an inherent, there's kind, it's kind of cutting a corner in my mind, because it, a lot of suppliers, like, they just don't want to carry any inventory, they don't want that expense. And I think it's at the cost of the customer's experience, and it's going to hurt you. So it's like, long term wise, I just don't find, I don't find the immediate gratification to outweigh the, the, the, the trouble, the extra work involved, and the downside that it causes in your business. A hundred percent.

19:01 - mytpix LLC
And Kelsey, do you have your MVP?

19:04 - Chris Andrade
What do you have everything you need to get something spun up? Or what does that look like for you? For me? Yeah.

19:13 - mytpix LLC
No, I don't have I don't have anything spun up. I mean, I'm I'm basically I don't even know where I'm I don't even know what I'm selling in supplies, really. Like, I don't I don't I don't have any numbers in front. I mean, the girls have the numbers, like, you know, the books or whatever, like how much supplies we're selling. Currently, like, I'm just telling you, like, Andrew, supplies is not paying my bills, dude. Like, that's what it is. So like right now, it's not but it could be if somebody took care of it and managed it like we used to in the old days. And that's, I mean, that's basically what my old business partner is living on right now. Like I went out and I instilled confidence. And like we had programs, you know, I say I would say, hey, you know what, we charge $75 for travel. But if you purchase one of my ink cards from me, I'll go ahead and whack that 75 off and I'll deliver it. We got so many customers. With the ink bags back in the day like that, because I gave it to him for free, you know, free cartridges for 30 days. I did that when I started my compatible venture. So anybody that's having afraid of compatibles, bro, I've been down the road. Like I already I'm on the other side of Amazon fixing all the problems that they're creating. So like we have a way to instill confidence and we have local support and service. So like if anything goes wrong with your printer, there's only like 6 million people in Phoenix, man. There's plotters everywhere. And I'm also building relationships. with all the dealers of all the other machines that I sell. So like if I really wanted to, the margins wouldn't be good, but I could even get OEM cartridges and sell them to people. Like I have the dealers I work with are for my friends. And so like when it comes to selling equipment, you know, like we could be selling more used equipment. It's just that I don't have time to do the follow up and the quote. Like I want to be there. You know, this guy has some serious questions about how this product is going to work in his facility and how it's going to be supported and whatever. Like I want to be that guy. But then has some serious And I'll implement it, but I don't want to follow up on the, you know, PO and the quote and then this and that. want to be like, hey, I just got a new customer here.

21:09 - Chris Andrade
They got this kind of printer.

21:10 - mytpix LLC
Send them a quote for what supplies we offer. Done. Like, then I forget about it. They send the quote. They follow up. That customer orders it. And that's how I have all my supplies business that I currently have is I started that way because I had nothing else to do. So everywhere I went, I was promoting my inks, telling people my inks, trying to get them to use it. I don't do hardly any of that anymore because I'm too busy. I don't have time to stop, and I don't want another order, really, because then I have to give it to Alyssa, and it just – I love Alyssa. She's amazing, but she's not the person that's going to follow up on something, and I don't think – I'm not saying she can't learn to, but I was talking to my sister-in-law last night, and she's like, Kelsey, she will do whatever it is as long as there's a process to follow. But outside of that, like, she's just not that person, and I just – I find it hard to relate with people like that sometimes. But I love Alyssa, and she would do anything for me. I I asked her to do.

22:01 - Chris Andrade
I just have to keep asking to do it constantly. It's the most important first thing a business owner can get, bro. It's an asset. And she is one of the most important assets you got. So I mean, yeah, I call her like when I'm when I leave a job, whatever I call her and I just tell her what I need done.

22:16 - mytpix LLC
And she does it all for me. You we all got down to what we're trying to get done is the foundation.

22:21 - Chris Andrade
We have to keep working on the foundation of your business to solidify these endeavors to support their obviously we. So my plan for you, Kelsey, is to come up with a way to like literally just try to 10x your revenue as fast as humanly possible. But it all comes down to the foundation. And that's what we kind of just keep focused on. And yeah, we appreciate your time. I think we do got it like a really good idea of of what we need to go to. Obviously, we still got a lot of work to do to get there, but we can keep you updated one way or the other. We do. We just wanted to make an introduction, I guess, and and let you know, you know, who, what we're trying to do at the same time.

23:16 - Customer Service
Oh, yeah. Did you hear that?

23:20 - Trent Christopher
Are you still there? Yeah, yeah.

23:23 - Chris Andrade
Sorry, wasn't sure if I was being talked to or not.

23:24 - Customer Service
So, yeah, no, I appreciate the I appreciate the call. And yeah, we'll keep a dialogue going. I think I need to talk to Kelsey just about some of the mechanics of. Oh, yeah. kind of. For sure.

23:40 - mytpix LLC
For sure. We're not making any decisions, bro. I just wanted them to meet you and explain.

23:45 - Chris Andrade
Like, I wanted you to meet these guys.

23:47 - mytpix LLC
I'm talking to you because I can't really explain it very well. I needed them to. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

23:51 - Customer Service
No, I hear you. Sorry, I didn't realize there was this whole thing. I know this morning.

23:57 - Chris Andrade
So I'm sorry. got wasn't prepared.

24:00 - Customer Service
I wasn't either. Yeah.

24:04 - Chris Andrade
He sends me this text message, hey, they're asking for my EIN, because we're setting up QO, and then we, us four, were in a meeting, and I was like, okay, well, we were just talking about QO, because we're literally integrating it right now, and just decided to get on a phone call, and then one thing led to another, and then we're like, well, is he available? Let's just try, and here we are.

24:25 - Customer Service
No, anytime people have to schedule something far out in the future, that's just not how I work. I'm available a lot.

24:34 - Chris Andrade
I do want to take a minute, too, and I really love the way you emphasize the eliminating, you don't like dropshipping, because it takes away from the experience, or it inhibits or gives another ability for your customers to get something bad, and you like taking that initiative on your own, and I value those types of relationships, because at the end of the day, customer service is the most important. So I really appreciate your insight and I value your input. And yeah, I would love to see how future endeavor goes. And whenever you have something in your daily workflow, like, man, if there's just a way that I can connect this system to this system or add something to that system, this is where, this is what we do.

25:23 - Customer Service
So now I, you know, I remember having to manually put in the addresses into the, each address field and I'm like, what am I doing? And I'd spend all day just doing literally data entry to like fill orders. And now with all these shipping, you know, programs and stuff, it just sparses all that, keeps a database, just makes it so much more simple. So definitely the way the tools are evolving, if you're not kind of, if you're not keeping up with that, just your customer, your, your, your competition is going to be more productive and more profitable. And you're, you know, you're working in a, in the old fashioned way that is not gonna make you, make you money. Oh, yeah, dude.

26:10 - mytpix LLC
I used to sit there for days, man, sending out emails individually, the same thing over and over to customers when I could just have pushed a button and done it once, dude, but I can't get my database together. I got thousands and thousands of emails, but I don't have a way to communicate with to them.

26:23 - Chris Andrade
Oh, yeah, we're gonna put your mind, Andrew, with what we got. So yeah, look forward to our next meeting, sir. It was a great pleasure meeting you. And then, yeah, if you ever need anything, you have my number. That's my direct line, just reach out. We love it. And, you know, we were, we just started our business, we're trying to turn this into our full time jobs. So we're trying to earn people's trust at the end of the day, if there's any other, I mean, you can talk to Kelsey offline, I'm sure he'll give you the context to who and how we started. And, you know, we take customer service very... That's to our hearts. So if you pass this along to anybody that you think could utilize our help, we'd be greatly appreciated and we would make sure that they would be mind blown.

27:16 - Customer Service
Yeah, I think I'm trying to figure out a place for myself and Kelsey's business. And and I think I have to start there before I figure out, you know, or understand how you guys would fit in that business, too. So, yeah, I appreciate it. I'm just all our information and everything like that.

27:39 - Chris Andrade
And yeah. So, again, I'll let you guys want to say goodbye and we'll talk soon. Thank you.

27:49 - Customer Service
Hey, do you have any questions for us?

27:53 - Mekaiel Abdullahi
Anything at the top? No, no, I'm, I'm, I, I, I liked how.

28:00 - Customer Service
I think it was Trent was talking about, or pardon me if it wasn't him, but I liked how he sort of had like an AI summary of a call, just like some, you know, some sort of data log to, you know, just kind of hold the hand of the processes between, you know, Kelsey and Alyssa and sort of client calls. And just, so it's not just him having to, you know, write something down in the car. Like, you know, I thought that was a good example of, you know, how AI can be implemented. That's kind of not complicated, but helpful. Yeah, exactly.

28:44 - Trent Christopher
And that's actually, that is what we're looking for is those opportunities to use technology. But we're also finding that the basis is there needs to be like structure or process that we can automate around. Okay. And maybe there's a tool we can wedge in the middle that can help make that process even better, faster, more efficient, right? And anytime that we hear about communications, or content creation, like creating and, you know, drafting an email is something that everybody talks about, but that's just an example of, you know, taking context of something, and then creating a piece of content that now you don't have to draft it. And you don't have you can tweak it and modify it and then send it. But we can do that with lots of different content, not just like an email, which is something that most email things have now. But the idea is, AI is a enabler tool, it's not something that's going to do everything for you. And we're looking for knowledge retrieval, we're looking for content generation, we're looking for communications paths, those are the things that are really powerful to help people with. Mm-hmm .

30:03 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
I was wondering, I don't want to take this conversation, I mean, we'll see where it goes, but I was wondering if you've explored, Andrew, like alternatives to FBA, because I noticed that you, or I remember you saying that you had.

30:22 - Customer Service
I did FBA, and I didn't like outsourcing my customer service to Amazon, and when it comes to that experience, especially in the printing business, lot of times people will order the wrong thing, and the customer will contact Amazon, and they'll say, this doesn't look like the right thing, they sent me the wrong thing, and then Amazon's like, oh, it's counterfeit. And you're like, no, they ordered the wrong thing, or, you know, it's like, oh, thanks, Amazon, lovely, you know, or the customer, you know, will search on Amazon for a part number, and it'll populate the wrong thing, and then you. You get the hammer just comes down on top of your head and so there's no generosity given to customer error experience and it's just all your fault and you know and it's fine and a lot of times you know somebody will go hey why does this box look different or what why is this the case you're like oh because the manufacturer changed the box style if you look here's why it's you know here's what the difference is like it's the same product inside but they're you know every five years they update. the box or whatever it is like so having Amazon outsource that it's like some sweatshop AI bought from India is just not going to create the same experience as someone that you can call and say like hey why is this why is why is this not working in my machine and like I don't keep a lot of SKUs and I know the product so like if customer is like hey the prints are streaky these cartridges don't work I can just say hey say hey

32:00 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
You should clean the printhead.

32:01 - Customer Service
You know, if you go into the system menu, just try doing a couple cleanings.

32:05 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
And then they're like, oh, these cartridges are empty.

32:08 - Customer Service
And I'm like, well, yeah, because you used it like a windshield wiper on the machine. And so it went through some of the ink. So you were, you know, you've used some of the ink to create a better printing experience, but it's not because I sent you cartridges that are empty, you know, and you can explain this stuff.

32:24 - mytpix LLC
We're like, how's Amazon going to explain that?

32:26 - Customer Service
They're just going to hit the, here's a shipping label that Andrew's paying for, and we're going to put a demerit on his report card because the client's got a 12-year-old machine they haven't used for a year, you know? I just can, I can weave through all that stuff that, you know, some, you know, that I just don't want to deal with that. Look, Amazon, it's great. And, you know, if you put up with that, it's going to be rewarding. And the alternatives to just, I mean, I only do FBA, I would only do it. If it was like the most vanilla thing, that if somebody returned it, I didn't care, it just was trash. And it was just straight from God's mouth and a no problem product. It was great because they could do all the fulfillment. And there was no, there was just no room for error, you know, and, but, you know, if I'm shipping to do everything FBA, I did that.

33:26 - mytpix LLC
And it was, it blew up in my face. So you use FBM, do Fulfilled by Merchant, right?

33:34 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Or? Nearly all, yeah.

33:37 - Customer Service
I mean, I'm not doing that any, I'm not, I'm not selling really on Amazon anymore, because, you know, they, they gated me over, you know, one return. And I'm like, I sold $10 million worth of product, one person returns something, and you're gonna like, just cut me off? You want all these letters? Okay, bye. I'm I'm done.

34:00 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
That is terrible, yeah. So you use, what do you use for, I guess you ship them all out yourself now? Or how do you, how do you do, how do you, what else was fulfillment? I would do fulfillment myself.

34:16 - Customer Service
I mean, I had Amazon and I was a big player on there and I sold a lot of stuff and I could do all the fulfillment myself. So Kelsey, Kelsey doesn't, Kelsey's gonna be, Kelsey needs to be small and profitable and, and, and build a network in his area. And, and then if that goes well, look into bigger ways to expand that. But, you know, he has to probably build the framework, you know, build the foundation in his, in his client base. And that's what I want to do because that's where it's the most beneficial, you know, like where you have customer service available, where you can send me out there and just like the Amazon thing.

34:57 - mytpix LLC
It's like, no, I'm going to send a technician over there and handle it. It's Thank Cause I'm always going to fix it in our favor, you know, like, we're not going to be like companies.

35:08 - Customer Service
I'm sorry to interrupt. The other thing too is as Amazon basically creates a walled garden where they're working directly with the brand holders that are setting the prices and there's not really any competitiveness on Amazon, because it's like just the, the, the, the, whatever manufacturer, the vendor, the vendors that are available to compete against each other has just basically been restricted. I mean, it's going to create a margin opportunity for Kelsey because like, if he can, if he's buying compatibles and, and, and, you know, I mean, I, I don't know if a customer is buying some weird stuff from China So yeah. On Amazon, It blows up their machine, and Kelsey comes in with a cape and says, hey, if you want to deal only in OEM, we can do that, and our prices are 20% cheaper than they are on Amazon, and if you want to buy our US-made compatibles, not some crap in China that's going to blow up your machine, you could save another 20%, or whatever it is, you know? Yeah. that's going to ingratiate himself to the client, and they're going to go, oh, man, I made that mistake now, I just want to, I just want someone that knows what they're doing, and I'm going to save plenty of money, but, you know, I always say, like, it really, you know, what is, I went to the barber shop one of these, you know, a million years ago, and it said something like, you know, the good feeling of, like, basically, it feels great to get a good deal. deal on a haircut until, don't You you don't want the cheapest haircut, you know, so, you know, it's, even though my hair's all messed up right now, but at least I have hair, but yeah, so I think Kelsey just needs to have, his business is going to be ground game and, you know, building a clientele base off that.

37:30 - mytpix LLC
Yeah, and I need somebody to back me up on it, dude, that's what I'm, that's what I'm looking for you to see if it's lucrative or not for you to get involved or not, you know, and then maybe we could build this into something that is a bigger, you know, in other places and stuff or, however, you know, I don't know, I don't know what it looks like.

37:45 - Customer Service
The is, mean, with Alyssa and stuff, with, yeah, with, yeah, with Alyssa, you know, like you said, her skill set is different than mine, so I think combined it's going to be good because, know, I can talk to customers. Yeah. Yeah.

38:05 - Trent Christopher
Yeah. And follow up. Okay.

38:06 - mytpix LLC
Well, we'll take it offline.

38:08 - Customer Service
And thanks so much for hanging in there and giving a little bit of insight on what we're trying to do.

38:14 - Trent Christopher
Appreciate it. All right.

38:16 - Customer Service
Thank you.

38:18 - Chris Andrade
Thank you.

38:22 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Thanks.

38:24 - Trent Christopher
Later, Andrew.

38:25 - mytpix LLC
Thank you. Yeah. That was a, that was, that was a lot of insight there, huh?

38:33 - Mekaiel Abdullahi
No, Andrew, Andrew knows what's up, man.

38:35 - mytpix LLC
I mean, like he understands the back end of it, but like everything he talks about with Amazon and all the stuff that he's dealing with, like, that's kind of like a mini version of what me and him could do together. And that's what me and my ex-business partner did together. He just went to his head.

38:51 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Yeah. And I was kind of wondering if FBA was going to be a good thing for, to help with inventory management and fulfillment, but. So. He's right. If you're not trying to sell to the whole country, and it's a niche thing where you've to have customer service that's related to printers, and all the stuff that comes with that, I can see how you can definitely run into issues with Amazon's customer Yeah, it's not the same thing.

39:22 - mytpix LLC
It really bums me out that Andrew got screwed because he actually is selling legitimate stuff, and I got so many customers that buy literally print heads from Canon that are just taken from the trash can, flushed out, and resold. They never even work, dude. And half the time, that ruins their printer. And all Amazon does is just give them their money back, but I don't understand how they're getting away with it, because they're selling it like it's an OEM. They're even like, it's totally pirated, dude. They put this plastic piece on the bottom, but it's not Canon's. It doesn't even have the pad on it. Yeah.

40:00 - Chris Andrade
Mekaiel, can we use that as marketing material? What? Like, do that storyline of just shining light to these people selling these used cartridges out of the trash, like, is there a way, I mean, look, at the end of the day, it's a hook for plotter mechanics to kind of just gain traffic or awareness, like if there's like an awareness campaign, because he needs social media, he needs help.

40:27 - mytpix LLC
I mean, I can make videos about it when I go on site, like once we start doing the video thing, I can, I can make videos, because I get them all the time, they got like plastic bags on them, like looks like saran wrap, I mean, I take them apart and look at them, but I can make videos and like, look, this isn't even a pump, like the reason why they made this is to pump ink, it doesn't even pump anything.

40:48 - Chris Andrade
And before you go to the meantime, just start collecting all the videos, and just start talking to that, and just that's your target when you are trying, when you think social media right now. Mm-hmm.-hmm. Mm Just use that as your target to identify the subject matter, to reference your videos on, and it will go a long ways for content. Yeah, I think so.

41:12 - Mekaiel Abdullahi
You can just start like a Google folder, throw it in there and share it with us. Okay.

41:19 - mytpix LLC
Is that the best way to do it?

41:22 - Chris Andrade
I got to get over to you, Kelsey, and we still, I got to, there's another thing we'll add to the notes of what needs to be done. Cause I need to get, I would like to get his phone and his laptop set up where we have the Google Drive, all of that, like ready to go. So when he starts filing transfer, he has like a process to do and follow like a flow chart of what goes where.

41:45 - Trent Christopher
Does that make sense? Yeah.

41:47 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
I mean, I think Google Drive is going to be pretty easy cause you just basically set up a folder on Google Drive. And then as long as we can access that, it's like, boom, boom. Yeah. I got so many different things.

41:58 - Chris Andrade
I just got to set it up. I got.

42:00 - mytpix LLC
Yeah, Dropbox.

42:01 - Trent Christopher
I mean, we can use Dropbox, too.

42:03 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Okay. How are you liking the microphone, by the way?

42:07 - Chris Andrade
Give me some feedback on that.

42:09 - mytpix LLC
I didn't use it yesterday because I forgot to put it on, but it's super easy to use. mean, I just... Auto transfer.

42:17 - Mekaiel Abdullahi
It's easy, too. I can do it from my iPad, but not from my phone.

42:20 - mytpix LLC
It says when I plugged it into my phone, it says it can't support that kind of power or something. But if I plug it into my iPad, I can just copy it.

42:27 - Chris Andrade
That's how I texted those messages to you the other day. Right. So your workflow is take the microphone, USB-C to your tablet... And send it. Yeah.

42:38 - mytpix LLC
It shows up in there in the files as a USB drive, and there's two of them inside the case.

42:45 - Chris Andrade
Are you saving it to directly the iPad or the Google Drive Dropbox? Oh, I didn't send them. I just sent it to you and deleted it.

42:52 - mytpix LLC
Oh, yeah. That's not a good...

42:54 - Chris Andrade
Okay, we'll see. Then we'll have to come up with a workflow on that. And then so we can... I think we need to...
ACTION ITEM: Create Dropbox folder for Kelsey; share w/ Chris, Matthew, Trent - WATCH: https://fathom.video/share/QaQrA5ztXaSzEH63m7HWY_pK_dJvhNLg?timestamp=2581.9999 Is there a way to set up like a remote Google Drive? Like I know folder out that is on his iPad that he can just have a folder structure on his iPad?

43:12 - mytpix LLC
I mean, I can just make a folder on my Dropbox and give you guys access to it. then I already have it in my phone. Perfect.

43:18 - Mekaiel Abdullahi
Yeah, I'll just make a I'll make a Dropbox folder and share it with you guys later on.

43:22 - mytpix LLC
I just I don't know if Alyssa ever got all your emails together so I can send it all out at once.
ACTION ITEM: Schedule 2nd Alyssa meeting; schedule Joe meeting - WATCH: https://fathom.video/share/QaQrA5ztXaSzEH63m7HWY_pK_dJvhNLg?timestamp=2605.9999

43:26 - Chris Andrade
But speaking of that, just so you're aware, we're not falling behind the ball here. It's just we're just trying to, like, you know, make sure we approach everything properly. So we got a second meeting follow up with Alyssa that we need to schedule and then another one or our next meeting with Joe. So we should have done by hopefully the end of the week or beginning of next week. OK, yeah, that works for Joe, that is would be better for you because whatever you want to work with. Joe just worked. He's available, dude.

44:02 - mytpix LLC
Like, he was busy yesterday, but today I got him doing a couple service calls for me, so I'm not going out, but, I mean. Is there a third day you would like us to do it on?

44:11 - Chris Andrade
No. Just tell me when it's going to be, and I'll make sure it happens.

44:14 - mytpix LLC
We can work around that. Okay. Whenever you want to do it, just let me know so I can tell him.

44:20 - Chris Andrade
And once we get an idea when that looks, okay? Yeah.

44:24 - mytpix LLC
And Alyssa, too, mean, she's, whenever you guys are available, she is pretty much available during, you know, nine to five.

44:31 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Right.

44:32 - Chris Andrade
To summarize what we kind of went over, Kelsey, is like, yeah, this is how important. We got to get your foundation built, bro. We got to get this thing solid, because once we get that thing solid, scalability is, it seems like it's going to be pretty easy, man. It seems like you have a lot of good avenues that can be multiplied really fast. It's just, you have to have the systems in place to do it, and that's what we're working on. Yeah, I understand.

45:01 - Mekaiel Abdullahi
I trust me, dude.

45:02 - mytpix LLC
I have a bunch of systems, but they don't work with each other. And I, I'm so tired of it, dude. It's just, it's so burdensome. Well, hey, man, listen, we're so excited to be here.

45:13 - Chris Andrade
So we thank you. Is there anything else you guys want to add on?

45:18 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
I guess just before I forget, I wonder, because you mentioned that Andrew, like, got kicked off of Amazon and stuff. And I don't know if he tried very much to get restored. Maybe he probably did. But, um, I, I mean, I could try to just see in my network with some people who do FBMs and just see like, is there a way like, cause he was doing 10 million revenue. Like that's, they should, they should fix that. would think I heard that. Well, he did. He said he did $10 million with revenue.

45:57 - mytpix LLC
I think it was like, like he was doing like two. Yeah, so what I heard is that happens.

46:04 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
When you hit a certain level, it just happens, but you kind of just need to push through. I heard that vaguely from someone, so I can reach out to them and just see what they do about it, what they did about it. Yeah, that'd be awesome, man.

46:17 - mytpix LLC
mean, anything to help, even if it helps Andrew and he doesn't help me at all, I don't care. I mean, I like Andrew a lot. I want him to succeed. I mean, he has succeeded. Yeah, yeah.

46:26 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Okay, I'll do that. Yeah, that's cool.

46:29 - Trent Christopher
Before we let you go, Kelsey, is there a chance that I could log into Vonage and know it's going to send you like a two-factor pin code or something? absolutely. Yeah, we need to document the menu system.

46:42 - mytpix LLC
Do you want to log into Quo for me and set that up? Because I lost wherever I wasn't there in the system.

46:48 - Trent Christopher
that's fine, too. I don't think I actually have the ability to log into your Quo right now. Maybe that's... let me give it to you right now.

46:57 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
And maybe we have it somewhere.

46:59 - Trent Christopher
Matthew, do you know? If we have it, or Chris, do we have the login?

47:02 - mytpix LLC
got it right here, you, you, it's Kelsey at plottermechanics.com, my phone number and the password is capitalplotter, P-L-O-T-T-E-R, with a capital P, at 2026.
ACTION ITEM: Disable Vonage admin 2FA; document IVR; prep port to Quo (Vonage + Kelsey cell) - WATCH: https://fathom.video/share/QaQrA5ztXaSzEH63m7HWY_pK_dJvhNLg?timestamp=2835.9999 And then it's your email address.

47:25 - Trent Christopher
Yeah.

47:26 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
then Vonage, for the, for the admin, is, do we want to, do we want to just disable two-factor on Vonage, so that we can just get in there? Sure. Yeah, yeah, yeah, please.

47:37 - mytpix LLC
I don't know how to do it, but if you, once you get in there, go ahead and do whatever you want.

47:40 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Okay.

47:41 - mytpix LLC
I'm not, I just did all that after I got stolen from, I got in this like rage of putting that on everything I had.

47:47 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Yeah.

47:49 - mytpix LLC
Um, so yeah, Vonage is gonna be, the, the username is going to be plottermechanics.com. I don't know if it matters, but it's a capital P and a capital M. And then the password is going to be capital May and then 91964. Okay.

48:09 - Trent Christopher
I'm actually going to log into that right now. Yeah, do that right now. And then you can turn on that authentication thing. Yeah, exactly.

48:17 - mytpix LLC
I don't have anything going on in Vonage except for that admin thing I showed you guys where it ports to the different numbers. But outside of that, I don't know how to do anything in there. Okay.

48:28 - Trent Christopher
Yeah, let's get this for the login.

48:36 - mytpix LLC
I don't know if you, the, the, the here, let me email you this link I have because it goes to a place called HTTPS admin Vonage.com management, blah, blah, blah. That's where you log in from. So how can I send this to you? Um, login.auth.vonage.com.

48:54 - Trent Christopher
Is that it? I'll tell you what it is.

48:56 - mytpix LLC
It's login.auth.vonage.com. Yeah, that's it. Yeah, I found

49:00 - Trent Christopher
It was kind of buried on their website, but yeah, I found it.

49:04 - mytpix LLC
Yeah, I have another user account that's like my personal one to log in from the app, but I don't think you can tell. It's 906-737.

49:16 - Trent Christopher
906-737. Yeah. Okay.

49:23 - mytpix LLC
But if you can get the Quo set up to record my conversation and have it come back to me, then I'll forward my calls through it and try it out and start using it for at least my conversations. I'll still keep texting from Jobber as much as I can so I can keep that communication going over there, but I'll let my phone calls go through there for now.

49:44 - Trent Christopher
Right. Yeah. mean, anything you want to try out there in Quo, you know, it helps us just make sure that you're going to be satisfied and it helps us get insight into how it's going to work for you. I mean, I know. Can you make Quo show up as a different number? that character or another. make

50:00 - mytpix LLC
It's outbound or no? Or it has to show up as its number?

50:04 - Trent Christopher
It can be any number you want that is on the account inside Quo, which means we have to make sure that Quo owns the number. So I can't make it just be any phone number, I don't think. It has to be a phone number that's ported into Quo. So we need to work on making sure that Quo works and then porting Vonage over to Quo so that we get that number over there.

50:25 - mytpix LLC
And then we can start, well, then we can decide how we're going to do the jobber number and the Quo. Yeah, exactly.

50:33 - Trent Christopher
I think that, you know, we're working through the jobber number to Quo. But yes, the number, your business number in Vonage needs to be moved over to Quo. Yeah. And then once you can verify, validate or give your blessing on your experience with Quo, we can go ahead and start the porting process of your personal phone number. And how does that look like real quick?

50:59 - Chris Andrade
right. Trent, that obviously the documentation and the support, because ultimately what we need to get as the agency is the, I guess the data, because Kelsey, we got to get your user experience like somehow recorded. Mekaiel, how can we do that as well? What do you mean by this user experience recorded?

51:20 - Trent Christopher
Yeah.

51:21 - Chris Andrade
Well, wait, because of what we're doing, right? We're testing out his experience with the, like we're updating his day to day, right? So we're going to integrate some sort of change into his normal behavior. No, nothing's changing, dude.

51:40 - Trent Christopher
My phone's going to ring. I'm not going to know.

51:42 - Chris Andrade
It's going to come back to your quote. Implementing QO and, you know, transcribing his phone calls, right? That's what we're talking about, right?

51:50 - mytpix LLC
Well, eventually you need the conversations to be able to dictate them. So I'm just trying to get it to where at least we're recording the conversations that I'm having so that at least you guys see. The other thing that I would ask is, I could use Quo for texting because I want to see how it handles multiple messages. Like if I send a group message to Jobber, if I include Jobber, it comes in as two separate messages and ruins it. So I don't know how Quo handles that, but I don't have any of my contacts in Quo. So what would be the easiest way to get them in there? Like when I take the ones from my Outlook and put them in there? Because they're not all, they're all messaged. There's like thousands of them. Where are most of your contacts being kept currently?

52:35 - Trent Christopher
Well, the one, I have them in different places.

52:37 - mytpix LLC
Like, I mean, I have my personal cell phone, which is linked to my exchange account, but I can't differentiate the difference between whether it's saving it to exchange or to my iPhone account. And then, so I got some in the iPhone and some in the exchange, but they all show up together. You know, there's a whole bunch of in there. And then I have like my Bible, which is capsule. That's my database that I started with. And so I still use that for all my passwords. work. And I'm assuming if we implement like ply or an inventory management thing, then we won't be using QuickBooks for making POs and either. It's going to have its own kind of interface or something. So that's what the girls are like researching and looking into because they're just trying to help me do it myself. But when I listen to them talking, everything that they talk about requires somebody to physically be doing something. And I'm trying to go the opposite direction, but they don't really understand totally kind of like Andrew, you know, they don't really, they think it's a fairy tale.

53:40 - Trent Christopher
Yeah. Well, okay. So here's the thing. At first glance, I looked at ply. I wasn't aware of what ply was, but like, you know, you brought it up and I just did a very quick, went to the website and looked at it. At first glance, it looks like it could be a highly valuable tool for you. And it does talk about AI features and all of that. Yada, yada, So we need to look at is how is it going to improve your process, right? And make it easier on you, not more difficult. for sure.

54:07 - mytpix LLC
That's why I'm asking you for your advice, because you guys know this stuff. I don't. I had an inventory system at my old company when my old guy managed it, and we did it through QuickBooks Professional, and he did a good job at it.

54:18 - Chris Andrade
But it was a lot of manual work.

54:19 - mytpix LLC
Yeah, there was no automation.

54:21 - Trent Christopher
We want to automate as much as we would, yeah.

54:24 - mytpix LLC
I mean, like, I'm assuming that Ply would have tools in it similar to the Jobber has tools in it for dealing with the customer interface, you know? Because I can't, like, I don't add my vendors into Jobber, because that would be stupid. I mean, I have added some of them in there, so I can communicate with them through there. So Alyssa sees my conversation, but it's a burden. It'd be better to have a different way to communicate with them. Hey, Kelsey, can I ask you a question here?

54:47 - Chris Andrade
Yeah. And we are already trying to plan for phase, the next phase of how this is going to work, right? planning the approach, right?

55:00 - Trent Christopher
Right.

55:01 - Chris Andrade
And so for the next phase, after we get this QO system integrated, are we wanting to tackle the SOP, obviously, but then how soon are you wanting to jump on this inventory thing? Because at the end of the day, we need to start kind of gathering an idea of what kind of budget you're looking for come February 1st. I think we've proven to you that we're more than capable. We are more than dedicated. And I'm just going to suggest that if you can try to budget a $10,000 budget for the month of February for us, it's going to allow us to be able to put that target a little bit more down range. And that allows us to get a little bit more things done in at one iteration. All right.

55:52 - mytpix LLC
And I recommend that we get this quote thing going as soon as possible so that we can show my sister-in-law and my wife who handle the money that I need. Right.

56:04 - Trent Christopher
I'm in agreement with you, Kelsey. We need to make sure that we deliver on value before we worry too much about, you know, allocating funds for the next days. Right? Yeah. I mean, but I understand, I understand what you're saying.

56:21 - mytpix LLC
I understand you guys are putting in a tremendous amount of effort into what's going on here. I mean, I, I feel like that. I don't really, I've been trying to like, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I You know, like you're going to be, you'll, you'll be able to go into a place quicker and see that they have their together and you could work with them. Like we're having to start from scratch right here. Pretty much. It feels like anyways. I mean, I have, I do have some processes. I was going to ask you guys, have you just spoken to my sister-in about the processes that her and Alyssa have written out step-by-step yet?

57:17 - Trent Christopher
She sent us some of them. So yeah, we had Alyssa send them to us in a digital copy. Perfect. Yeah, we have those.

57:25 - mytpix LLC
Okay. Cause I know that that's how you need those steps in order to be able to implement some sort of strategy. And so I wanted to, I mean, my, when I say I don't have anything together, like I really do have a lot of things together. I just don't know where they are. And my sister-in-law and them, they have all this like written out in a book.

57:39 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
The one question I have, and I don't know, it might be in those SOPs, but I want to understand how capsule fits into everything. Like, I don't know necessarily how, if we need access to it right away, but like.

57:52 - mytpix LLC
I will give you access to it if you want, but basically all capsule is, is a conglomeration of a bunch of data. The databases that I plugged into it from different trade shows, all my exchange contacts, my QuickBooks, like everything was in there and we were trying to implement it, but it was too manual intensive. Like it just basically started to compound tasks to where I just got crushed by it and I couldn't even handle it because I didn't understand how to use it right. And nobody taught me and I have ADHD. So it's a bunch of garbage, but there's a lot of valuable information in there. So like there's more information in there than in Jobber, like the only information in Jobber is what we've manually entered into it or that came from QuickBooks, but we never pushed the, the capsule database. So capsule has like all my old contacts. Like when I say I have thousands of emails addresses, I have my original deleted items inbox from my old company still on my inbox. So, I mean, I have emails all over the place, but I don't know how to get them out of there and like tell people, Hey, I'm over here now. You know, know, like, Hey, are you guys disappointed with your customer service? Because I am. And. And the people are looking, they're coming to me through other means through my Google reviews and referrals from other companies and things like that. But I'm starting to get more and more of my old clients just because of, they're not doing a good job on service, dude. They got their delivery guy doing the service calls and he sucks.

59:18 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Yeah, so I think Capsules sounds exactly like the type of thing that's like, there's a bunch of information in there. It's really annoying to use. Like, if we can start, uh, understanding how that's used, I think we can plan out the roadmap and figure out like, you know, how more.

59:34 - mytpix LLC
I show you how I was using it and I stopped using it a long time ago, but it's still doing things in the background. Like there's, there's like some stuff that I put in my exchange server. So like every time I send an email out or receive one, like it's tracking it and putting it into the, into there, into the database. Like, that's how it was supposed to work was like, it has a utility that goes into your outlook. So you can basically take a message right there and you can add the. We never fully integrated or started using it because I was the only one trying to utilize it and the other people were not really, Alyssa tried to get in there with me with my sister-in-law, but it just wasn't the right thing. And my sister-in was like, Kelsey, I will help you implement Jobber because this sucks. And then she came over here and she put it in place for me and helped me, held my hand, did a bunch of screen time videos with me, showed me and got me onto it. You know, and we struggled for a little while, but it got us way more efficient on the back end. You know, I mean, I think it did, but it's still, there's just more going on now. So whatever I alleviated, there's more of it over there now. And it's like, there's too much of it. I'm having a hard time, like to figure out which way to go sometimes. Yeah. I think, I think there's a lot of data that's, I don't know how to manage data, dude. So like, if, if you want to look at it, you can, I, I literally, I went back through my old customers. And my emails, I spent days and hours and weeks on this. And I would go in there. And I would figure out what machine they had at the time, like this is old information now, but, and I would enter it in there, but I never got to a point where I could utilize any of the information. So I was building a database of this person's the plotter person, I've spoken to them, there's an email conversation in here, you know, there's a task for me to follow, but I just, it was too labor intensive. I just couldn't do it and do what I was trying to do. I could, but I.

1:01:21 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
So it's great that you got all that stuff into a database because now like what ideally for us, if we can see the full picture of like all the data that's available and useful for the business, we can design the ultimate vision and then we can kind of work backwards into it and figure out what softwares are going to make sense right now, free to use versus the longterm. Um, maybe we just start building in the background of the longterm right away and not take too much of our actual time, but is that, is that, is that the API thing or is that the database, the background database that everything can reference? Yeah. Like it's, I mean, the. My provision is kind of like, if you have everything in one place, that would be perfect, but we're trying to work towards it, so. Sure.

1:02:06 - mytpix LLC
Well, there's a lot of information in Capsule that is old, and probably we could filter it somehow to find out, because I have old, I mean, I got 20 years of information in my contacts and stuff, you know, like, a lot of it's not good anymore, a lot of it's changed, I mean, this is like pre-COVID , dude, so.

1:02:23 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Got it.

1:02:24 - mytpix LLC
But, you know, all of the agencies, the governments, I mean, all those people I've worked with in the past, you know, I've got a lot of that information, I just don't know how to utilize it.

1:02:34 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Yeah, I mean, I could see at some point if, you know, outreach, potentially, like when you're going to scale, I think we, what Chris said, we got to focus on the foundations first, but we understand the data model, then we can start building towards that vision.
ACTION ITEM: Email Matthew Capsule export (contacts + custom fields) - WATCH: https://fathom.video/share/QaQrA5ztXaSzEH63m7HWY_pK_dJvhNLg?timestamp=3769.9999

1:02:50 - mytpix LLC
Yeah, yeah, that Capsule thing requires there to be a two-step authentication as well, but when you guys want, like, would it be helpful? If I just were to like, if you just exported the data out of there, or Yeah, that that would help.

1:03:06 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Like, more, more so we just need to know what the data looks like. So like, email, name, address, like, whatever type of data is all I have, I made a bunch of custom fields.

1:03:20 - mytpix LLC
So like, ink type, machine type. Okay, I had like fields like that. So I could filter like, you know, I want to know everybody that has a design jet t930 that we work with. I want to know that . know what I mean? But I don't have that right now. Because then I could be like, hey, we're doing this thing on this or that or, you know, service or there's this kind of problem on this kind of machine or, you know, whatever. But I was trying to build all that stuff. But I just was doing it alone.

1:03:49 - Trent Christopher
I got another question real quick. While I'm in right now, I'm trying to look at the menu system. Yeah, menu system that you have looks like you got 12345 and zero. menu system. Oh yeah.

1:04:01 - mytpix LLC
Zero goes back to the, the one phone that I have sitting in the office, but I don't really advertise that number. So like if somebody hit zero, it rings there. Or if I call in and that number and hit zero, it rings at the desk for Alyssa, but can you give me a recap maybe?

1:04:15 - Trent Christopher
Cause it doesn't say in Vonage, like it just gives me forward number to phone number. And there's just a phone number. So can you give me just a recap on what one, two, three, four, five? One is for service. That's my number seven, two, two, nine, three, two.

1:04:28 - mytpix LLC
Two is for supplies. And that's Alyssa's office number. I don't know the number, but it's a six, two, three, number, uh, three, three, nine, six, one, six, two.

1:04:39 - Trent Christopher
Yeah. That's the, I believe that's it. Let me just, yeah, that's gotta be the office number.

1:04:43 - mytpix LLC
Cause that's where that rings. Let me just make sure favorites office.

1:04:46 - Trent Christopher
Yeah. That was nine, one, six, two, nine, one, six. Yeah.

1:04:50 - mytpix LLC
So that's my office Verizon phone that sits at the office that Alyssa has got it. Okay. And then the number three is for sales. And that's me.

1:05:00 - Chris Andrade
Let just go real quick. You guys can work on it. We got a lot of stuff to do over here. Yeah, yeah. Go for it. But hey, Kelsey, appreciate it, man. Thanks for all the good details. Yep. Later, man.

1:05:10 - Mekaiel Abdullahi
Thank you. Yep. Thanks, Kelsey, too.

1:05:12 - Trent Christopher
No, no, no. You guys can stay on it. Yeah, let's finish up, Trent.

1:05:15 - Chris Andrade
You need to drop it off. Yeah, yeah.

1:05:18 - Trent Christopher
I think this is the last thing I have is just to verify these menu options. So, yeah, three goes to you.

1:05:24 - mytpix LLC
Three goes to me for sales, and then four goes to Joe for printing.

1:05:29 - Trent Christopher
Got it.

1:05:30 - mytpix LLC
And five goes to accounting, and that's Nicky. Okay.

1:05:33 - Trent Christopher
So, of all these conversations that come through all these numbers, which ones do you think are going to be valuable or not valuable to understand the conversation itself? Well, extension one is going to be the one because that's my extension.

1:05:48 - mytpix LLC
Yep.

1:05:49 - Trent Christopher
You, which would be one and three is you, and then the other extensions, though. Do we think Nicky? I'm thinking probably not. No, Nicky's... Nicky's...

1:05:59 - mytpix LLC
Nicky's... Nicky's... Nicky's... She's not actively part of what's going on. Like when, you know, like the stuff that she's dealing with is like you owe us money or we owe you money, but it doesn't have to happen like to get something done. She's not part of the day-to-day stuff that we do typically. Yep. Yep.

1:06:15 - Trent Christopher
And then it would be probably pretty valuable to understand what Joe and anybody else is communicating about, right? Oh, yeah. No, for sure.

1:06:23 - mytpix LLC
I mean, if anything printing related comes through, it's the same thing. Like I, I made a video when I walked into my office the other morning, but I walked in, I was going to, I think I shared it with Chris, but my printer was running. I walked in and I had left the heater on. I heard this noise. I was like, that's weird. And I walked over and the printer was kicking out like a half an inch worth of prints. And I was like, no way. Like Joe, and I talked to Joe and he, he actually logged onto his computer from his iPhone and sent the print job at like seven o'clock in the morning, probably from bed.

1:06:50 - Trent Christopher
And it was printing out over there. And I'm like, no .

1:06:53 - mytpix LLC
So like, like what, like for instance, I don't have a good way for people to upload their files. You know, like I wanted to come up with a form where they go there, they fill out, you know, upload their file, and what pages do you want? One through 10, 11, 12, you know, put it in that format for me. That's how I'm going to print your job. And then it would know, like, here's the file. Here's the pages that need to be done. Here's the size that they are. And this is what the invoice is going to be. And, like, all that could kind of be done ahead of time. Right. Right when they upload it, you know, what happens all the time is, like, someone, I'm like, this guy wants this, printed this and that, so Joe's over there printing it, and, like, we haven't even quoted it yet or nothing, and, like, there's no paperwork. I'm like, dude, like, make some paperwork for this . Like, I've been really getting on them just recently. Like, I'm like, look, I need you to make a task to do this. And he's like, okay, I'll do that. I said, no, I mean, I need you to make it right now. Like, not later, just do it, man. Like, it's never going to start happening until you put it on your calendar. And that's how I've always worked, bro, Trent. Just like you.

1:08:00 - Trent Christopher
Just shotgun, like, just do the thing and then figure out how to clean up the mess later? Well, just get it on paper.

1:08:07 - mytpix LLC
Like, when I used to, when I had my old system and my old QuickBooks, I treated every phone call like it was going to be a job. Like, it may not have turned into a job, but I didn't, like, wait for the job to get there before I made all the paperwork for the job.

1:08:19 - Trent Christopher
Yeah, you do it ahead of time is the way it's supposed to be, but it doesn't work out that way in reality.

1:08:23 - mytpix LLC
Well, if you do it ahead of time, it usually turns into a job more than if you don't. You know what I mean? Like, if you're, like, planning on it being a job, it's kind of like speaking it into the existence or something. Like, if you're not heading in that direction already, like, I just, I found it that way for me, you know? But I don't, I have a different way of thinking about stuff than some people do. Yeah, like, you're getting all the details down.

1:08:46 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
You're focused on it. You're, like, treating it as, this is a reality. I mean, I'm not talking to the guy on the phone because I don't plan on going and helping him.

1:08:53 - mytpix LLC
You know, if I sense that it's not going that direction, I don't talk a whole lot. Yeah. yeah. I mean, I have to, yeah, I have to, I have to discern who I'm dealing with now because I deal with a lot of the people and a lot of people are just trying to milk you for information and stuff. And I'm okay with that. You know, I want to educate people because that's really not what I'm trying to do. I think the more I educate people, the more that my credibility is going to grow and the more bigger opportunities I'm going to get. Yeah, for sure.

1:09:21 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
And the key is doing it in a scalable way too, into the future. Yeah.

1:09:27 - Trent Christopher
Yeah. Well, I appreciate it, Kelsey. Um, we love hearing all of the wishlist items. We are, we are excited to be able to help you out with all of them because they're all excellent examples of ways that we can help you and, you know, anybody else that we come across these problems. Cause these are actually fairly common. Everything that you're experiencing, I think is, uh, uh, at some point in time, every business owner experiences it. Hey, Trent, what's your, uh, what's the text message number?

1:09:53 - mytpix LLC
I can send you the screenshot of my capsule login. You just got to, um, you just got to, uh, I gotta say. And you got to call me or I got to give you the code or something when you log in because I only have one. I used to have like multiple licenses of this, but since I'm only using it in the background, I just kept my license. So we all share my license, but I constantly am having to send that code because I got it on too many devices. So it's no big deal.

1:10:16 - Trent Christopher
Yeah. I mean, if you want to, you can text me. You have an iPhone? Yeah, I do. Yeah. If you want to text me, you can text me at 740. 740.

1:10:25 - mytpix LLC 358. 358.

1:10:28 - Trent Christopher 9011.

1:10:31 - mytpix LLC
There you go. just sent it. Oh, I don't even have your number in there. Let's see if got that.

1:10:39 - Trent Christopher
I'm watching. If it's an image or something, it'll take a second. It's a little picture.

1:10:44 - mytpix LLC
Um, it, when you log in, it wants to know the company name first, so you got to put plotter mechanics. And then my username is that Kelsey and the other ones don't exist anymore. Okay.

1:10:55 - Trent Christopher
Okay. And then once at that point, it's going to ask you for the pin number.

1:10:59 - mytpix LLC
your убилmee the six without It's good. They're to send an email to me, actually, because I had it that way for the girls so they could check my email and get the code. Got it. Yeah. Yeah.

1:11:07 - Trent Christopher
Okay. Perfect. Yeah. So right now, you know, one of things I'm testing here in the background is I'm actually working on the Jobber integration from Quo, trying to make sure that we can get information into Jobber when you guys have a conversation. So we want to as soon as we can finalize that, we want to at least demonstrate it to show you, you know, what we've got. And yeah, headed before we start to implement it on your side, make sure it's, you know. yeah.

1:11:34 - mytpix LLC
Yeah. And then. On the Vonage, you got the login for that. Oh, that was going to say the Vonage has contacts in it. Then those are a mirror of what's on my cell phone, I think. And there's like multiple duplicates of it in there. It's a mess. OK, let me see if I can get to that, because I'm curious to see.

1:11:51 - Trent Christopher
And then you guys, I think I gave you my email login and password, but that has thousands of contacts in it, too, that are just all messed up.

1:11:59 - mytpix LLC
Like.

1:12:00 - Trent Christopher
Yeah, it's like you sort of need like a central place to be able to make sure.

1:12:04 - mytpix LLC
Well, what happens is everybody calls my cell phone and then I give a list of the information, but then I have to put their name in there. So like my naming convention is their name with the company name and like what machine they have. So like my database is just a bunch of , not in fields because of the way the iPhone displays the names. Like I don't know the company or the I have to put it all in one field or I don't I can't find it because I got thousands of Jesse's in there and Jim's. And yeah, yeah, so that's but capsule allowed me to filter that information in a way that it didn't really matter. You know, like when I had even though I had thousands of thousand contacts when I typed in the few keywords, like I would get to the bottom of it and then we merged a bunch of the stuff. So like I had multiples in capsule for years and then we started merging the ones together that were multiples of the same thing and like correcting the ones we were. But now we just quit doing anything over there and we do it all in jobber and even jobbers messed up, bro. And. You have a chance, like I was looking at that with Alyssa and the fields that they allowed us to create in the beginning are not very valuable to me when I'm going through my daily routine because there's a lot of, you got to bounce around from field to field. So like we're, we're streamlining a system where it's Alyssa's putting the notes right in the visit for me. So I don't have to go look at their terms. Like we're coming up with like a payment thing because I've had, I'm having a hard time getting paid on some stuff I do because I'm so busy, like just trying to get things done that I'm not like taking any time to like make sure I'm going to get paid and I don't have somebody really following up on it with me. So I had a big meeting with the girls on Friday about like different processes of how we're going to stop people from doing that because like I'll go out and do a job and I'll finish the job and then the person with the credit card disappears and I'm standing there going like, where the 's the guy that's going to pay me, you know? And then I leave and instead of like being on top of them to get paid, I, nobody says to me for like three months and then they'll be like, oh yeah, we never got. I'm like, well, it'd have been nice to know, like, right after it happened, not three months later. So I mean, I'm not good at that either, bro. Like my wife helps me with that. But my AR has been like, up to $100,000. And I'm like, , I need to start collecting money, you know, so then I got to change my focus from going out and doing service calls to driving over to people's office with my wrenches in my hand saying, I'm here to get the parts that I dropped off over here unless somebody has a credit card, you know, and like like that. Yeah, that sucks to have to deal with that.

1:14:28 - Trent Christopher
But especially if it's been so long since the, you know, it should have been paid like way. that's exactly.

1:14:34 - mytpix LLC
And that's what I'm trying to tell these guys. like, you guys can't let this get out three months and then tell me like I could have done some because a lot of times when they can't get paid, I just got to make a phone call.

1:14:42 - Trent Christopher
all of sudden they're writing checks and all kinds of stuff because I'm is there where would you go or where would Alyssa go or where would Nikki go to see that information to know if you're late on?

1:14:53 - mytpix LLC
Well, if you, if you like log into jobber, like we made some fields in there. So like we, we have a plotter contact one plotter contact two. So supplies contact, bill paying contact, like we have those specific fields. And so like, as Alyssa has been building the new database, she has a much better grip on who's who because she's putting them in those fields. But what I, but what happened in Jobber is when they create the fields, I don't know how it handles it, but you can put a field on a visit and a, or a field on a company and on a job. So like, you can have the company. And then they just recently added into Jobber contacts within a company. So like when I came from Capsule, it was a because I was like, what the ? I, I couldn't bring my database in Capsule is a company and then there's contacts underneath of it. Well, in Jobber, it wasn't like that. So all they had was one field that it could be a person or a company, but you couldn't have contacts under it. So we created a bunch of our own fields. And then they added the contacts field later. So now you can add multiple contacts within a company, but that wasn't that way six, you know, a year or two ago. So now pretty much all those fields that I custom fields I made in there probably are wrong and it should have been put in there as contacts and not as our own custom fields that we created and we have the same fields on the company and on the job and they can be different so like you need to like when it comes to these special fields it needs to be identified whether or not it needs to follow the job and be unique per job or if it's unique only by the company like if it's a global. So basically what she's been doing now is like in the when I look at my calendar when I show up at the job I have my visit and on the visit there's the instructions so instructions now are going to be star Z means they're going to pay with Zoe when I leave star RCC is run credit card when I leave you know we're coming up with like this naming convention in the background so I don't have to sift through like four different tabs to figure out how this guy's going to pay me like I don't want to figure out how they're paying me like that's what I tried to tell those guys yesterday I'm like look you guys should be figuring this out for me like I already got the I to call me, took all his information, scheduled the job for tomorrow, like, who the 's gonna call and get his credit card for me, because I don't have time for this , you know, like, I don't, don't get mad at me because we didn't get paid, like, do it proactively ahead of time. And the only person, so Alyssa's got more procedures now. So the new thing that we're gonna do that we sat down yesterday is like, I'm like, can't you guys like send these people like a $1 credit card payment charge, just to verify that their card is good?

1:17:27 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
So I got a, I got something that my uncle, he, he owned a carpet, uh, cleaning service for several decades. And that's what my sister-in-law does.

1:17:37 - mytpix LLC
Just, just, just so you know, my sister-in-law actually implemented jobber into her husband's carpet cleaning business, just so we're on the same page. Wow, cool.

1:17:46 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Um, so something he told me, cause I asked him about like, he was helping me like hang up Christmas lights, uh, this season, or just try and start doing that on the side a little bit.
ACTION ITEM: Implement $75 non-refundable travel fee in Jobber; collect CC on file - WATCH: https://fathom.video/share/QaQrA5ztXaSzEH63m7HWY_pK_dJvhNLg?timestamp=4678.9999 And then he, um, he told me like, what, what you. What you what you can do is you can charge a just a trip charge. So I was wondering if you do that, like at all, like, that's exactly what we talked about in our meeting yesterday, bro.

1:18:09 - mytpix LLC
That's perfect. I said, Look, yeah, let's just charge them the $75 travel fee. This is what it costs non refundable just to show up to get you on this calendar. And then when I'm then we already got their credit card entered in jobber. And then when I'm finished, they can either run the credit card right when I'm done because the work has been completed. Or if they want to sell me or give me a check, when I'm done, I'm fine with that, too. But I just need to be paid when I leave. that's Alyssa's job in my job to implement that rule up front. Like I just got to tell them that's how it is. And that's how it's going to have to be. But it's going to save us a lot of time on the back end of trying to collect things. Yeah, 100%.

1:18:44 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
And would you be opposed to because you could charge it before you go out?

1:18:49 - mytpix LLC
And that's what I'm that's what I'm that's what I'm planning on doing because I want to get their credit card on file. But I you know what I'm saying? Like, I don't know how to do it. Because at the same time, like, I'm I So I don't want to charge them the full amount because the way that I do my work is I don't want to be paid if I don't necessarily fix it, but I am going to exert an hour of my time into your of my life into you.

1:19:10 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
So I'm going to have to get paid for that, you know, like, yeah, like a trip charge is just to cover that like that, that going out there. So like, if it might also help to like, once you start getting like, I mean, we could, you could scale up your volume, I'm sure. So it might even help to weed out the people who just don't have money for a few months and they might be like, no, like, I can't do that right now. And then you're like, okay, fine. Like, sorry. But, or like, I mean, okay. Yeah. A lot better customer service than what I just said, but, uh, you get, if they can't afford to pay you $75 up front, they can't afford to pay you $250 when you're finished.

1:19:48 - mytpix LLC
That's what my sister-in-law said. And I said, okay, fine. That's true. Because all those ones that don't pay are a pain in the . I don't want to work for people like that. I want to work for people that appreciate what I do and are happy to pay me.

1:19:58 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
And I'm getting to that point.

1:20:00 - mytpix LLC
Or I can, I can say like, I don't really want to work with that person, you know, like, I don't, I don't have to. And I don't, I want to work with everybody. But there's just some people you just can't work with. It's just every time you interact with them, you lose. Yeah, yeah.

1:20:14 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
That's one of the things I've heard how you build something scalable is like you, you, you spend your time on the ones that are actually like returning a lot. And you have a lot of times there's, there's like a huge percentage of people who it's like a lot of work. And then it's just, it's like not that much return.

1:20:32 - mytpix LLC
So, well, I see that when I'm talking about like equipment sales, like if we got down a marketing campaign where we would, you know, reach out to these people and tell them, Hey, we're selling these printers and whatever, like that, I mean, I have a target market for all that.

1:20:46 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
And I have the stuff to sell them.

1:20:47 - mytpix LLC
I just don't know how to reach out to the people and tell them, you know, or even just like a simple one would just be a one year followup on a previous year service call. Hey, it's time for your one year preventative maintenance call. We haven't been out there because we haven't generated an invoice. So when can we set it up? Like, don't even ask them. It's like, are you going to change the oil in your car this 5,000 or are going to skip it? Yeah, yeah. Because a lot of people that are checking that stuff, they're looking for something to make their job worth their time. You know, oh, I got the plotter serviced, you know, like in the lunch meeting, whatever. Like, nobody takes care of their plotters ever, dude. Like, I want to educate people like, hey, how about you service this thing before it takes a instead of wait until it takes a and spend a bunch of money.

1:21:27 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Yeah, that outreach is a great idea because then they get something in their inbox. They're like, oh, yeah, I should do that. They weren't even thinking about it before. Exactly.

1:21:35 - mytpix LLC
And then like, same thing with supplies. Like, hey, we serviced your HP, this and that. And we, did you know that we carry this compatible product for your machine that could save you money? And then we support it a hundred percent and you can try it for free.

1:21:46 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Just give us a call, fill out this form.

1:21:48 - mytpix LLC
We'll send a technician over there tomorrow and drop it off. I'll do it for free, bro. I did it in the past. It's the only way to make it work because there's zero obligation on the customer. The secretary doesn't have to convince the boss of anything. Thank you. I give them a certificate that I've already designed that has my guarantee on it that says what I'm willing to cover if it hurts their printer, because I've never ruined a printer, dude. So that thought is not even close to my mind as far as that goes. I have problems with my product, but I take care of it 100%. And if I was better at rotating my inventory and things like that and not keeping something on the shelf for three years and then selling it, I wouldn't have some of the problems I do have with some of the stuff. You know, developing an RMA process like that's part of pile like I don't know how it handles it I have a meeting with him on Friday because I want to ask some questions but like I have cartridges that go bad and like I don't really know for sure if that cartridge is coming back to me in a credit or in a form of money or whatever because they're laying all over my shop and like I don't know where to put them like I don't know what to do I don't have a system to put them in like that's what I'm noticing and that's why I want to do the inventory because what's happening is I'm bringing parts back to the shop like I do a job. I'll bring back a part that works. That I could sell later on, but I have nowhere to put it, like it's sitting on the table and then it's in the way on the table that I put it in a box and the box gets put on the shelf and then I never see it again. So part of the inventory thing, like with Joe's got spare time on his hands and stuff like that, I want to go through all the parts I do have, which isn't a lot of parts. have more like supplies and things like that, but I want to separate everything that's a value in inventory into a, I have a container over there. That's a, that, that is sitting there like kind of available and I want to condense it all into there and figure out what I really do have so I can decide what to do moving forward because I'm at the end of my lease on the space I have. And I mean, I, I don't, I don't know if I need more space or I need to just be smarter about what I have in my hands because there was a time when I was gathering up equipment to sell, but that's become more of a burden to me. I I'd rather kind of sell new stuff like I have available to me that's better. You know, I mean, I should not, I should sell used equipment. I mean, I can make $4,000 $5,000 on a printer. The thing is, I'm just telling you guys this, like what I'm starting to find is it's better for me to put the person in contact with somebody that sells printers and say, look, dude, pay me a referral fee, you handle all of that, and then hire me to do the installation and maintenance and service down the road, and I'll take it from there. Because I don't want to be the sales guy selling the guy the thing because I'm too honest of a person for sales, dude. Yeah, I get that. mean, they asked me a question, I'm going to tell them the truth, you know, like this guy tried to get me in the middle of an insurance scam, and he's like, what did you tell the insurance guy? I said, I told him the truth, dude, just like I told you the truth. Like, I'm not, if you're hiring me to lie for you, that's not happening, dude. Like, I've already been lied to enough. I'm not, I'm reaping what I sow. Like, I'm not going to sow lies because then I'm going to reap them. He's like, oh man, you're so much different than you used to be. I was like, well, that's because I'm getting smarter, dude.

1:24:54 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Like, I don't, I don't, I want to help. I don't want to help.

1:25:00 - mytpix LLC
I help people, but I don't want to get taken advantage of or get used or whatever.

1:25:05 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
100%. Yeah. And then if you can collect a referral fee, it's like you got paid, you know, it's obviously less, but you're getting paid for what you did, which is just sending the referral off. You know what would be good though?

1:25:16 - mytpix LLC
Honestly, like that being said, like I've been thinking, I could probably talk forever, but like having a network of a place where people can sell and buy used equipment where, you know, like, it's just like a, like a, like a, like a swap meet of printers. Like if somebody contacts me and says, Hey, I want to sell this printer. I'm like, Oh, I got a database of people that want to buy and sell printers. Like, and, and put them into that database because that way I know who has what or whatever, and let the customer keep the machine and then sell it from there, you know? And then I'm not the guy like you bought it from them and you can hire me to implement it because like, I have opportunities where people want to get into this business, but to buy a machine is going to cost them 20 grand. And I could get them into it for seven, eight grand. I don't want to be the guy that sold it because then I'm the guy that has to fix it for free or I feel responsible like if something goes wrong and I don't know how to justify that like I don't want to just like when I sell stuff I'm not selling it like it's Craigslist you know what I mean like I'm selling it like it's a solution and I'm going to support it but I got to be clear about what that warranty entails you know like it doesn't include the print heads the consumables it you know like it only includes a 90 day warranty against machine failure like I don't have those those that's not clear cut up front so that there's there's there's questions later on you know what I mean like I don't I don't have it all laid out because I'm just not that organized yeah so something like that marketplace like what I do what Alibaba does when I when I buy inventory from from China to sell on Amazon like they they have this thing called trade assurance so there's like a whole policy where like if they you know if the inspection inspection doesn't go well

1:27:00 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
If don't have to pay the deposit and all this stuff, you can walk away. They define it. If you get screwed over, basically, you can walk away. Chris also had this idea of a marketplace related to his contracting stuff. So if we're—I'm just thinking one of the key components of making some sort of marketplace, if that's the route we end up sometime down the line, we would want those policies defined at the marketplace level. And then maybe each seller could have their own as well. But then the other thing, before I forget, is just the inventory. The more you get it figured out in your physical space, like what you need for your operations, the easier it'll be for us to design the data model on the back end, because we might just be able But if it works really well for you, might just be able to use almost the same thing, just add on the technology stuff, like fields, or whatever we need. So, that'll be cool. I noticed, I mean, looking at your, the pictures that Chris shared, like it seems like there's, things are fairly organized. I mean, I'm not in it in the day to day, but it seems like things are fairly organized and there's like labels on certain parts, at least in some places. It is on the consumable side.

1:28:30 - mytpix LLC
Like Alyssa has a system over there where she can, you know, she, she knows where to go get this or that or whatever. And, you know, she has a bunch of stuff written on there, like how many she has and whatever, but we don't, it's too manual of a process. So like we take stuff out of there and don't check off the box and then we don't know what we have and it's not in a system, you know, like, it's just not, it's, it's ready to be put into a system. We just don't have a system to put it into like, I'm ready to do it. I just need a place to do it. So for the consumable. I have a handful of parts that are new that are not that valuable, but I have a bunch of machines that parted out. This is part of the inventory thing. Some of these machines I'm getting now, they have valuable parts on them. I know what they are. So I want to take a machine, say it needs a printhead, but everything else works on it. I want to pull components out of it and inventory them and have them available. I'll to myself later on when I need them. Like, you know, a power supply for a latex printer costs 1200 bucks, dude. I don't want to throw that thing away.

1:29:38 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
But I also don't want to have it in a pile of I can't find.

1:29:41 - mytpix LLC
So when I assign a dollar amount to it and I put it on my shelf, I'm going to, it's going to have a lot more value to me. And when I look at my shelf and it has $50,000 worth of on it, I'm going to be able to put that into some sort of context. You know what I mean? Yeah.

1:29:56 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Yeah. So, so with the system, with the part that's ready. I think that all we're missing to kind of get started on designing the inventory management solution is just get it like under, we don't, we don't have, we don't, we're not in the shop. So we don't know kind of how it works. So if we could get like some sort of thing written down, if there's anything written down already about how that works and how Alyssa uses it, maybe that's what we'll even talk with her about in the meeting. But if we could get any information ahead of time, too, that would help us ask better questions.

1:30:33 - mytpix LLC
Yeah, I mean, she's basically keeping the compatible supplies and a couple certain print heads for certain machines, because I work on a majority of the same type of stuff all the time. Like when I take on a unique project, I'm not really dealing with the consumable side of that. I'm just helping them. I may not even sell product for it. I work on a lot of machines. I don't sell supplies for, or I could get supplies for, but I don't pursue it, you know? tell. I don't have anybody following up trying to sell the supplies. So unless I physically have it in my hand or on the shelf, I'm not like trying to sell it because it's a lot of work to bring a product in, add it to the system, put it on the website. You know, we can't even actually do that right now. Okay, so yeah.

1:31:17 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
She's just got a system.

1:31:18 - mytpix LLC
I don't know what it is, but she knows like the gist of the things that we run out of all the time. So she tries not to let that happen. You know, like 36 by 300 paper, like we can't be running out of that . Like that's like running out of toilet paper when you're taking a . Like, yeah.

1:31:33 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Yeah. But, but she's got to manage all that herself. She is.

1:31:38 - mytpix LLC
And that's, yeah, manually. And so, and she doesn't understand the industry. So like, I look over in the corner. I've seen like 40 rolls of 22 inch paper sitting there. And I'm like, who the hell is you ever going to buy that? I've only never even sold a roll like that. You know what I mean? So now I got this bunch of paper over there that nobody understands why we have it and nobody. Yeah. Does she have a spreadsheet?

1:31:58 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
what mean? mean? Do Do Do Do Do

1:32:00 - mytpix LLC
I mean, I don't know what she has, dude. Okay. No, she doesn't have a spreadsheet. mean, she has a whole bunch of . I'm not going to say what she has or doesn't have because I don't know. She has something over there because if she doesn't, she can't do anything. So she's got something that she's referencing as far as that goes. I just don't know the process. If I see something's empty, I tell her. I say, hey, can you order some more of this? Because we keep our inventory low. know, like when print ads cost $500 a piece, I don't want 10 of them sitting there. Okay, so it kind of works for you.

1:32:27 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
It's not like you're losing money too much on it.

1:32:30 - mytpix LLC
No, I haven't lost a ton of money, but I don't honestly know how much inventory I really have over there. I mean, if I had a swing, if I had to guess, I'd say maybe $50,000.

1:32:44 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Okay. And that's equipment and stuff like that.

1:32:48 - mytpix LLC
But, you know, because of I don't have an inventory system, I don't have a good way of keeping track of a printer. So, like, let's say I buy this printer for $2,000. Now, it needs a bell. A couple of print heads and a power supply. That's another thousand bucks. So now I spent $3,000 on this printer. Like I don't have a way to keep track of the stuff I'm taking out of my inventory and putting into that printer. So at the end of the day, when the guy wants to buy it, I know exactly what I paid for it because I don't remember everything I did. I have a gist of it in my head, but that all needs to be accounted for. Like you can't just take a part off the, a cartridge off the shelf and then stick it in the printer and then not account for it. Like it just, you got to apply that expense to the sales of the printers. Right. Yeah. And like, I understand that all that stuff, but I don't know how to make that happen. Well, I do know how to make it happen. And you basically have to bring, that's another thing. Like you have to bring an item in, like say you sell a certain printer, T930. The way we used to do it back in my old company is every time we bought one, we'd bring it in as a new part because we would sell it and it would disappear. And there's gotta be a better way to do that in inventory software where you just have one skew, but multiple serial numbers of it or something. Does that make sense? I think so. Like if you buy the same printer over and over, you shouldn't have to add a new SKU for it every time you add it. But that's how we managed our inventory.

1:34:13 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
That's what I'm saying.

1:34:14 - mytpix LLC
I had a guy that did this, so every machine that came in or went out, like he had a serial number, he had a purchase order, and we knew what we paid for it. And I try and do that as well. Like if I'm going to buy a printer, I tell Alyssa, make a purchase order for this printer so that I can, so we can write a check for it and I can pick it up. So I do have that, but then when I go to sell it, I'm not necessarily selling that SKU number. I'm selling just the part number because I don't have it down like that. So that's why my inventory is all messed up. Like, so I need to stop now that we're fixing the QuickBooks thing and then add all of the products I have into there so I can start from scratch fresh with a good inventory and then start doing inventory checks. But I don't want to implement all that into QuickBooks. If I'm going to do it in a third party software, you guys are going to help. So that's why I'm bringing all this to the head because I don't want to be doing something you guys are doing and I don't want to be doing something unefficient that you guys can do more efficiently. mean, I'm not doing I don't want to do anything unless you guys know about it. Actually, I'm not I'm trying not to. It's like, yeah, yeah, because we want to figure out the best way.

1:35:16 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Like, is it going to be a custom app that we build? Like, does it have to be or does it is there an existing like printer ops managing software out there that we can find that we can just get you onboarded to and then like, what would be the ideal like if you could just if you have like a list of like, the printers, like the common ones, like on your website, there's you already have you already have like all the printers laid out there and like cartridges and all this stuff. Yes. Like, if you could just, you just have like an admin dashboard version of your website that's just like, shows you like your team like the inventory for each one. And then you could just like, I don't know, maybe

1:36:00 - mytpix LLC
Like maybe like manually just update the numbers there just to start like the simplest would just be like, I mean, that's all I, the thing is about inventory is like, it got messed up a long time ago with us managing our own QuickBooks and we, the guy that used to work for me, like he would make mistakes and then like, like one day he imported all of the parts from my old company into my new company, like hundreds and hundreds of products in QuickBooks, dude. Like, and I'm like, what the is this? Oh, I brought all this in. I'm like, what is this? five-year-old information, bro. Like then we had to delete all of the items and add them again. So our inventory got messed up and it screwed my books to hell, dude. Every time you take stuff out and move it around, like it has to go somewhere and we never figured it out. So that's why we're just, I got an accounting lady, bookkeeper, Nikki and them got one. We got our taxes fixed. We're redoing our QuickBooks. She's going to help us make the journal entries, but on the back end, what it does, the QuickBooks, you can't just go in there and be like, all right, I got a hundred. So I think that I don't know how to implement that into the QuickBooks without cooking the books again. That's what I'm trying to not do. So I don't know how to do it. Like you started our QuickBooks over. All of our old inventory numbers are inaccurate. So we're starting from scratch. And I'm hoping that the girls are figuring this out. But I would be totally fine with a system where I could just put the numbers in there. I just don't know how that's going to affect the back end of the books, or it's going to need a journal entry or something, because that thing's going to have a value associated with it. And where did it come from? Like it wasn't here. Now it's here.

1:37:40 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Yeah, so we would need to keep track of like, okay, when did this inventory number change? Like just I'm just thinking about just operations side, like, we don't even have to have an integration with QuickBooks at all yet. Just like, let's get the get it where you can use it for inventory management. And then at least if you have like a history of When did this number change?

1:38:02 - mytpix LLC
Well, it's got to be connected to Jobber for that to happen, right? Because we're using the SKUs. I mean, our QuickBooks, like every time an invoice gets generated, it automatically pulls it from the inventory, or it's supposed to. Okay.

1:38:14 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Like, when you make a purchase order, and you receive it, like, that's another thing. QuickBooks Online has no way to receive a PO.

1:38:21 - mytpix LLC
So you basically go from ordering it to entering the bill. And there's no step in there about receiving it, which is, I mean, unless they changed it. They didn't used to have that. So, that's stupid. We don't have, we don't even have that in place. Like, if we place an order, we don't have, like, a way to follow up on it to see if we actually received it or not. Like, we're not, I mean, I know what we're ordering in my head, and I'm expecting it, but, I mean, like, random 's not just showing up or whatever, but when.

1:38:50 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Yeah.

1:38:53 - mytpix LLC
Like, but the, yeah, the inventory side of it, like, it, once we get it right, like, every time we sell one, it's going to go out, and every time. And then when you check it later on and it's not right, you have at least if you check it every quarter, at least you can kind of go back and reflect about it and be like, oh, yeah, you know, maybe this or, you know, where did we sell all these at? And, you know, like we used to be able to find those mistakes a lot because we stayed on top of it all the time.

1:39:18 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
But yeah, OK, so jobber is like inventory going out because it's it's clients like certain things. But then do you have what about for on the vendor side, like when you buy from vendors, how do you keep track of that?

1:39:33 - mytpix LLC
Well, we send them a purchase order out of QuickBooks and then that PO is open until you enter the bill so you can enter the bill in before you actually received it in QuickBooks. Once you enter the bill, it receives it for you and puts it in there as a as you have it when you don't necessarily have it. So I think that's where plywood come in as plywood give you some sort of a system like. And then when you check it later on and it's not right, you have at least if you check it every quarter, at least you can kind of go back and reflect about it and be like, oh, yeah, you know, maybe this or, you know, where did we sell all these at? And, you know, like we used to be able to find those mistakes a lot because we stayed on top of it all the time.

1:40:18 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
But yeah, OK, so jobber is like inventory going out because it's it's clients like certain things.

1:40:26 - mytpix LLC
But then do you have what about for on the vendor side, like when you buy from vendors, how do you keep track of that?

1:40:33 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Well, we send them a purchase order out of QuickBooks and then that PO is open until you enter the bill so you can enter the bill in before you actually received it in QuickBooks.

1:40:49 - mytpix LLC
Once you enter the bill, it receives it for you and puts it in there as a as you have it when you don't necessarily have it. So I think that's where plywood come in as plywood give you some sort of a system like. I'm hoping it's like this. mean, I don't know, but I mean, it would make sense.

1:41:14 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
I'm going to see a demo about it on Friday.

1:41:17 - mytpix LLC
Got it. Okay, yeah. Definitely give us feedback on Ply once you see the demo. Yeah, no, I will. I'm going to look at it and see. I got some questions about it and stuff, but I just don't want... I'm not going to implement it or do anything with it unless you guys are aware. I just wanted to let you know that's what my sister-in-law is trying to do to help me with some of the things I'm dealing with. Well, that's perfect because we have things that we're working on this week, and then we're just in the planning stage of the next phase.

1:41:44 - Trent Christopher
So just collecting information, that really is going to help us to plan it out.

1:41:49 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Yeah. No, it's important. I know from my past experiences, the person that was supposed to be navigating the thing didn't even understand what I was doing totally. So at least... Yeah. You guys are trying to figure out what I'm doing and not trying to like do something and make me do it that way. I kind of like, I really like that approach.

1:42:10 - mytpix LLC
Like you're, you understand like totally up erupting my whole entire thing is going to cause stressful situations. I appreciate the approach that you're trying to like not get in the way, but I'm not afraid to do something like that quote thing. I want to do that because that's holding this up and I want to make sure it's going to work.

1:42:27 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
So I'm ready to do that. Like as soon as you figure out how to forward it to me, are you going to have to create a new, uh, a messaging thing or what do you think, Trent?

1:42:38 - mytpix LLC
Or can you just pass it right through? Um, what do you, what do you think in there, Matthew on what you're proposing here? Um, so I think, well, we were just talking about how like we, we have like this sort of cadence of like, we need to plan the next step and sort of collecting information on the inventory management stuff for now. But.

1:43:00 - Trent Christopher
But then we kind of switched gears back to Quo. So Kelsey had a question around Quo. Like, are we, how, what was your question again, Kelsey? Oh, I said, are we going to need to create like a queue? Like, thank you for calling Plotter Doctors, dial this, dial that, dial whatever. Or can you just pass my phone through Quo and come back to me through the Quo app and just record it for now? So the Quo can have a, it's, it can have like a greeting like that.

And then a, a phone menu. So we're, No, but I'm saying this temporary, like this, this test we're going to do where I just forward my number to Quo and it, it, and it starts ringing on the Quo line and I pick it up from the Quo app on my phone.

1:43:45 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Oh, okay. Yeah. I think you and Trent were talking about that. So you won't, you, you don't need to do anything, right?

1:43:50 - Trent Christopher
It'll just like, they'll call me, my phone will forward to Quo and then the Quo app, I'm going to start ringing on my cell phone, like as if I'm receiving a phone call.

1:43:58 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Yeah. Like right now, I think.

1:44:00 - Trent Christopher
I that's how it will work, is that if you were to currently just star 7-2 forward at all, it should just start ringing in the Quo app, and the Quo app, you should be able to just answer it, and that's just do your thing. Just have a conversation, and... That's it? It's already set up? I mean, all it's going to do is you're going to have a conversation, and then it should transcribe it, so it will be in Quo, it's not actually set up to do anything. No, yeah, I understand that, but that's it? Is that easy? Yeah, should already be, yeah, it should already be ready to go to do exactly that. All right, so let me see here, so the, the, let me try it. I'm going to hang up, and then I'm going have you call me right back in like one minute. I'm going to have to, forward it, let me find the number here.

1:44:45 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Clutter Mechanics Quo.

1:44:50 - Trent Christopher
Yeah, so he's like wanting to test this stuff, like while we're on the call, I kind of like it. Yeah, yeah, that's the iteration, right? It's not like a client where it's like, oh, it takes, it's three weeks to

1:45:00 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Just get us access to something, right? Exactly. Exactly. So right now I'm in the background trying to figure out this integration with Jobber. I've got transcripts going in just like they showed up for Quo with notes. I am just trying to like it each time I do it, it puts in a new request.

1:45:22 - Trent Christopher
If someone the way that I understand Quo works with the built in integration is that if you have an open request from the same contact, it will just add as a new note.

1:45:32 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
It doesn't create new requests every single time that person calls. So if they call you once and they leave a message and then they call you again and they leave you a message, that's two notes but one request.

1:45:43 - Trent Christopher
That's actually perfect, I think, because otherwise you'd just be getting way too many requests. Yeah, that's what I'm trying to, that's what I'm trying to have out here. Right now, the way that my integration is currently working is it's creating a new request each time, but I'm trying to, I'm trying to work with Claude here on it.

1:45:58 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
So. Thank you.

1:46:03 - Trent Christopher
Yeah, man, so he's going to get this stuff transcribed. He probably just sent a quick message. I wonder if he remembers that he has to click the Google Meet link. But you have his phone number, right? Yeah, he texts me. So I have his number. And he can text me back, too, if he has something going on. Okay. I think he said he was going to jump back on here. Yeah, just give him a second. Let's see what happens. Yeah. Yeah. But, I mean, yeah, he might get pulled into something else, too. Oh, nice. Yes. Okay. So now this last iteration, I have two notes on the latest request. Sweet. Dang. So he wants to call him. Hold on. He wants me to call him. Okay. He says, all right, try calling me now, and let's see what happens. Okay. Okay. Okay. Hello? Hey, how we doing? Oh, you sound pretty clear, man. Are you on Quo right now? Yeah, yeah, it rang through the Quo app, and I'm on the Quo app right now. Oh, that's pretty sweet. at my house, so I'm not, I'm on my Wi-Fi, so I'm not like on the road or whatever, but yeah. Interesting. So I'll, I'll basically just leave it like this, and then every call that goes to my personal cell phone will just route back like this, and it'll record it at least. Yeah, just get started with that, and then if for any reason it does some weird stuff, and you're like, nope, I don't like this, this is stupid, tell us immediately. Oh, I will, yeah. And then did you do that registration for the text messaging yet, or no? No, I haven't done that yet, so you won't be able to send outbound messages. You can receive messages, but you can't do outbound messages yet. So if I import my personal cell phone number over to Quo, then I can use it. Yeah, you'll be able to, but you still have to do this registration to get it approved before you can send messages. But yes, your phone number will be in quo, so therefore you can use it as your outbound and inbound phone number. Yes. We might just do that, bro, and then just phase out the old number. Like, not get rid of it, but just stop using it until no one uses it anymore. I mean, how does it work when you port a number over, you pay for another line every time you do that? No, what would happen? Okay, so the way that quo works is you pay per user, first of all. So if there's like you plus Alyssa, that's two people you have to pay. But you get a phone number for each one of them. You get to choose a phone number that quo assigns you, or you can port in a new number or a different number from somewhere else. So for example, if you've got you and Alyssa, we could have Alyssa's phone number be the business phone number, and we can have you be your person. And then they're both in quo, so therefore it allows us to do whatever we need to with both numbers. Well, I'd say we bring in my Vonage number, my personal cell phone number, and then that'll be two of the users. I'm still going to keep an Office Horizon phone for Elisa to use because that's going to have the quo on it, but theoretically I wouldn't have, she could just have quo on her own personal phone or something if she wanted to and wouldn't have to have two phones. Correct. Yeah, she could have, you could literally just have the quo app on both phones if you wanted to and she could just ignore the call or whatever and it goes to both phones. You can use the quo app and it dials every device that quo is assigned. Like you log in as a user. you to, like you can, you can say like for service dial this extension and it'll. Yeah, absolutely. It could do that. Yes. We could even have it go to where we could even have it to where you do service. It calls you first. You can't answer. Then it'll pass it on to Alyssa. Oh, yeah, that's perfect. Yeah, we can do all of that. That's all that's all possible built into Quo. We just have to set it up that way. Yeah, that's good. Yeah, no, I mean, I'll start by doing this. And then if this works good, like as far as like communicating with people, I won't I won't make outbound calls or anything. I'll just do this. I'll just receive all my calls this way. And that way you kind of know better as to what calls I'm actually receiving during the day, because it might not be as crazy as I think it is. Yeah, that's it was organized. Yeah, this is actually a really good idea. actually, don't I mean, we were thinking just go ahead and do the full switch. But this is a way that sort of halfway in between. It's easy to reverse if you like in the field, if you're like, Oh, this is , I can't handle it. You can just immediately switch it back over. So don't So There's no way that this is worse than Vonage. So I'm safe moving away from Vonage into this just from the aspect of just the way it works. It just seems way easier. Vonage is like a corporate, like, it's like for giant systems and . That's not for what I am. It's person to manage it. Yeah, I watched a video that talked about Quo and how well it works with Jobber, people that use Jobber and things like that. And the person that created Quo, or one of the co-founders of it, she was talking about how all of the other platforms were designed for large corporate. And they wanted to build something that was for the smaller businesses that do service. So it's kind of built for you. So in a way. So it's great. So yeah, I'm ready to, I'm ready to transfer my personal number and the business number both over there and set it up. And I mean, even if we don't record the AI or any of that. Like, just from a standpoint of it going there and people communicating with me on that platform instead of my personal number all the time. Okay, okay. It's too hard to separate, you know what mean? Like, my life is Plotter Mechanics right now. I'm trying to separate it. So my phone number is Plotter Mechanics' phone number. Yep. And my personal cell phone. had that number when I was, that was the only thing I got out of my divorce, dude. My ex-business partner, as messed up as he was, he couldn't keep my phone number. Cause my dad kept calling, trying to get ahold of me and he's answering it. And he's like, look Lonnie, got to get Kelsey back his phone number at least. That's about the only good thing he did for me. Oh, that's awesome. Yeah. got my number back, which has paid off in a lot of ways that I don't even know because I passed that number out for years and years. I mean, I got so, part of the reason why my cell phone number is being called constantly too, and why I need to get rid of it, is all my service stickers have my personal number on it. Yeah. That I put on machines. Yep. Because Because when I worked with the other people I worked with, I didn't, I was trying to guard my customers from my office staff answering the phone. The guy that I fired, I mean, I had this guy with me for like the first four or five years and he did everything for me on the back end. And everybody's like, you can't fire him. He does everything. I said, watch me, dude. Like this guy kicked me off one more time and doesn't show up to work on time again. I'm done. I can't do this anymore. And I finally, I finally just paid him. I said, look, dude, I've asked you, I've begged you, I've given you every tool you could possibly want. And I said, look, I can't do it anymore. I'm done. I said, here's two weeks worth of pay. And he says, well, you haven't paid me for the last two weeks either. I said, oh . Well, here's the month we're gonna pay. Later, dude. If I need you, I'll call you. And I never called him back. And the only thing that it, the only thing that really hurt me in that, and it didn't hurt me because I don't use it anyways, is he did on my website. Like everything that you see on my website, there's a shitload of information in there, dude. Like, crap.

1:54:02 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
I he did a lot of work on that, but I never utilized it or made any money out of it.

1:54:07 - Trent Christopher
It's just, basically, I had have a website when I started because when I first started my business, the first people were saying, was like, don't you have a website? like, well, no. I'll get one, you know what mean?

1:54:18 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
So we got a website, tried to make it look professional.

1:54:20 - Trent Christopher
So, because forever, I've always, like, when cars could first get wrapped in the beginning, I wrapped my plotter doctor's truck that I had. And, like, people thought I was, at the time, like, they thought we were like a franchise, dude. Like, the way that we represented ourselves in the field, in our uniforms, we all wear scrubs. I wear scrubs to work every day. What are those ugly shoes? Crocs? Yeah. And I wore a doctor's outfit, dude. dude, I rode that for a long time. It was fun. I liked it. I had a hot nurse on my logo. I got... I got threatened by HP's lawsuit. I had a lawsuit from HP when I started my company. I worked for another place. I got fired, and I started Plotter Doctors, and I had this little guy, like an anime guy, back in the day. And he was standing over a monitor with a, with a, uh, deathoscope. And my brother was into Photoshop back then, so he took the end of a well-known plotter and replaced the monitor with it. And that was my original logo. I still have a card with it. Well, later on, my brother was created. came up with my logo. You know how HP's logo used to be HP, and it would kind of slant it sideways inside of that rectangular bezel? Yeah. Well, I took a P and put it first, and I put the D opposite, so it was like PD. And it was symmetrical. It looked perfect. It was inside the bezel, and I rolled with that for probably, I don't know, man, five years. And then HP's attorneys reached out to me and said they were gonna sue me. Oh, man. And so I was like, . I you know, because I built a brand. I had come from the CAD store. built up my name. Now I got HP on me saying they're going to sue me. So I was pissed off. And so I told my brother and he was designing and stuff. And back then, like I was going up against a major company, bro. The CAD store was well known all over the state of Arizona in multiple days. So I was going up against them. so I was angry. And so when they told me I had to change my logo, I go, you know what, Tim? Find the hottest nurse you can get and let's go with that. So he found some, like, anime nurse sitting on, like, a stool with a short skirt and big kids holding the syringe in your hand. Yeah. And that became the new logo. So we got, we kept the HP bezel, but instead we put the red cross in the middle of it. Oh, that's awesome. that, that was, that was very, um, my mind was in a different place back then, but sells, dude. I had that hot nurse on the side of my car. Bro, people, you'd drive to the parking lot at Walmart and kids would be going plot or doctor. And then, dude, was at a military base out in Tucson, and I'm standing in the elevator one day in my scrubs in my outfit, and this lady from the Red Cross shows up in there with me. She's like, oh, you work for Red Cross? They go, no, I'm six printers. I was over there at the military base, just helping the military out on the middle of nowhere. And then, like, not even a month later, did I get a letter from the Red Cross. We're going to sue you. You're going to keep using our logo. And I'm like, you got to be joking. So it was a Red Cross inside of HP's bezel, which was gray. And I'm like, this is just a Red Cross. We don't give a . So I tried to do a Band-Aid.

1:57:43 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
I did a Red Band-Aid in the middle. sent that. They said, nope, that's not going to work. I said, you know what? So I went and got the logo that has the snake wrapped around it. You know, the blue one that's like six-sided? Yeah. That medical logo that has six arms? And I plucked that on all my cars. I just made a circle. I plucked it on the cars. I plucked it on my business card. I didn't change my outfit because I'd never seen them again. And they finally left me alone. And that's the logo they're using today. Plotter Doctors. And oh, I own PlotterDoctor.com, too. Oh, wow. Okay. I don't know how I got it, but one day I was sitting there and my old company was called Plotter Doctors. And I was on this thing and I saw Plotter Doctors. said, you might like this. For 300 bucks, you can have PlotterDoctor.com. I was like, I do like that. I'll take it. And so I've just been sitting on PlotterDoctor.com and it just forwards the plotter mechanics. Yeah, I just saw that. It forwards it. Wow. So, okay. So like, we're also thinking about doing like this. I know you said you got the car wrapped as soon as the car wrappings came out and stuff.

1:58:54 - Trent Christopher
And you're like, like, at some point, I think it would be really cool if like... You know, you remember in Microsoft Word, they had like Clippy, the little assistant inside Microsoft Word. I don't know if you guys know about that. Yeah. So yeah, it's just like, it's like, you know, helpful little assistant, right? Yeah. Something that we think about often is like chatbots. And like, I think, I don't know where how like the plotter doctor domain name ties in. But at least on your website, like, once we have the knowledge base of like, your SOPs and like your trainings, and like, we could basically hook all that stuff up and enable a sort of like a chatbot on the website that's and we can, we can try and customize it to and like make it, make it cool or make it however you want. That sounds awesome. Yeah. Like a, like a cool AI thing would be good. Like most of the AI that you deal with out there.

2:00:00 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
It's pretty crappy, but like my ChatGPT Andrew thing, when I let people talk to it, they're like blown away with like talking to it because they have never talked to anything but Siri or whatever. Right, really sucks. Siri is terrible. Yeah. No, Siri. Andrew is what I named my ChatGPT guy. Oh, really? But yeah, I gave him a name. So like now everybody calls him Andrew. Like my sister-in-law, she's like, will you be talking to Andrew lately? Because my sister-in-law, like the one that's so standoffish, like I was at her house over the holidays and we had like a lengthy conversation with ChatGPT and that was her first interaction with it outside of Siri. wow.

2:00:41 - Trent Christopher
Okay. So she was kind of impressed with it enough to where she brought it up at her dinner when I hadn't seen her in like a week and her husband.

2:00:52 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
So I think it's cool. I think it's cool technology if it can be like managed or like whatever, but it's not like so just.

2:01:03 - Trent Christopher
So yeah, so one way we can kind of make it cool is like if you if you can just if you just come up with ideas for how like you want your company to be represented through this like assistant that's on your website that helps people like a little plotter doctor or something or nurse or like whatever you think would go over well, like we can try and figure out how to make it customized like I'm not like we can I don't know exactly how to do this right now, but make it like a character We can figure that out Yeah, what kind of prayer do you have? You know? And it says you tell them what kind of prayer you have and then it tells you what you can get for it or something, you know? Yeah, exactly. It can kind of like you can walk them through just the basics at first like we would we might it might need to start out Land like just with your colors of your logo and be like a cool little widget But eventually we could make a whole like character, like personality behind it. Yeah, yeah. No, I like the idea. That's cool. Yeah, no, I think like, I don't really know what is available or what can be done. So like, any ideas you guys have are exciting to me. But anyways, that's just, I'm sorry I kept rambling on, but that's how my history went. So that company, I walked away from it. After the cab store went out of business, my old boss basically turned over her whole entire HP database and all the parts in her trailer and the technician that worked for her. And then we started kicking , man. I mean, I had all the government accounts.

2:02:46 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
were just making money like crazy. And then I started going through my divorce and then it just, Nick left.

2:02:52 - Trent Christopher
He was the guy that I hired from the cab store and went to work for another company. And then I walked away for like an entire year. And then I went back for a few years and then I... I for another year and then I just, I quit doing it all together in 2020.

2:03:05 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
So I went through like 10 years of like divorce before I started over in 2020. So I'm excited to see like it's taken off again, because this is what always happens is like, I get out there and I start doing stuff and then I start generating interest in leads and this and that.

2:03:24 - Trent Christopher
then it starts to get too much to handle. And I'm at that point now to where I need help.

2:03:27 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
You know, like if I'm going to grow, I need help or I need to retract and do less and just try to be happy with that. But that's just not my human nature. don't think. Yeah, I feel that. I don't think that's how we've Yeah, I want to see where you can take it and what you can do.

2:03:49 - Trent Christopher
I feel like now I'm getting to a point where I can, you know, invest into my business a little more. You know, I don't have a lot of money, but I don't have a lot of overhead either. what you I So, like, what little money I would pay myself, I'd rather put it in my business to try and make it more better for the future. Yeah, and that's where we got to make sure that that money goes to the right places that are going to actually help you scale. Because, like, we don't want to spend all our time on something like a chatbot like that, where it's not really the first thing that you need. Totally. Totally. No, I don't. I want you guys to lead me. Don't let me lead you because you won't go anywhere. Yeah, no, but it's good to capture all these ideas and just get them down. can plot them out in the roadmap and then get to them when they will help. Because at some point, it will be the top priority thing once you're at a certain level or whatever we figure out. But, yeah, it's good to capture. I the quote's working good, man. I mean, like, right now, as far as our conversation has been, I haven't even been able to tell whether we're on Bonnage or Quote. Yeah, I agree on my end. It's been exactly the same. Bonnage, but Verizon. Yeah, it's been exactly the same. Like, for me, I don't. So based on what we talked about just now, I would say, let's just start working on the process to get things migrated. If nothing else, let's try to get, you know, Quo needs to have the ability to text out so that you have that ability. So let's get that moving. And then let's get Vonage moving to move it over to Quo. But we need to replicate the, menu system. that was one of the key things that we talked about earlier was Vonage to make sure we have the menu system in place so that you don't have any, it doesn't break your system. Right. So, and then we can start. You can copy it. You can copy the recording that I made on the other one and probably use it over here. Or we can just record the recording if we have to. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So let me, uh, let's, let's look, let me. It's all there. It's like, it's like recorded. It's like a, Yeah, I'm still logged into it, I think, let me just make sure that I'm still logged into it, so I can, yeah, I'm ready, regardless of whatever, like, I'm ready to port Vonage over to Quo and my personal cell phone over to Quo just to get them all at the same location, and then I can, you know, as far as jobbers text messaging goes, I don't know, but I'm implementing and using that, and I'm trying to shift people that way, so I'll continue trying to push them to jobber, because at least that's an essential appointment. And I'll try not to, but what I need help with, though, is I need to get my contacts out of my phone and put them into Quo so that I can actually find people I want to call. Yeah, so one of the things I'm kind of wondering is if, look, I haven't actually played with the Quo app as much, I'm wondering if there's a way that it's closer to integrated with your contacts and your phone. Yeah. I'm fine about that, too, know, because I know Vonage wanted to grab all my contacts all the time, so I'm sure just wants to. I just don't see where that's at, it's probably in the settings, inboxes, oh good, sync contacts, and under settings, sync contacts under settings, Matthew says, oh right here, contacts, is it okay if I sync it? Yeah, go for it, I mean the worst case scenario, just, worst case scenario, we disconnect that feature and we just delete everything in Quo, it's not going to affect your contacts you have. Okay, perfect, so it says keep your phone's address book contacts adequate, sync your address book contacts, but display them on this device only, or sync your address book contacts, and see them everywhere you log into Quo, that would be better because that way it looks like what I'm dealing with. Yeah, mean that, that basically makes it to where your contacts are all shared across everybody that's in Quo, so like Alyssa would see that. thank you. All right. Enable, sync contact, sync everywhere, continue. There's 14,684. That's just a few. Is that okay? I don't know. I see why not. I I don't know. I'm not bragging about it. It's a mess. It's mess. I don't know if that is. Let it go. 14,000. If it breaks, I got quo on the hook. If it breaks, I'll just call them up. Say, what's up? Well, contact suggestions. It says it has contact suggestions are on powered by QAI or whatever that is, but it's so I guess it's syncing. It might take a minute. Yeah. So one of the things that quo does is it will like it has the ability to hear your conversation. If you guys talk and say names on there, I think it will make suggestions on the naming for your contact. So it'll like will kind of automatically. Yeah. If you just like say, hey, this is this is Kelsey. I'll see It'll pick up that it's Kelsey. If you don't say your last name, obviously, it's not going to know. Or your client says who they are, right? It should hopefully be able to pick some of that. Yeah, that'd be awesome. Yeah, I'm excited about that part of it. I'm excited about it recording the conversation and dictating it out so that it's caught, basically, so I don't have to remember to do it. Yep, exactly. That's kind of, that's what we're working on right now is to try to make this really easy that when you have a conversation, it is put someplace that you have access to it to either come back to it or Alyssa has access to it so that she can just hear it or read it so that she can just do what she needs to do. Yeah. Yeah, that's good, man. Yeah, yeah. So that's exactly what we're trying to work on is get it, get it to where it's nice and fluid and easy for you guys to have the information you need when you need it. Yeah, yeah, no, that's great. Okay. Well, I'll let you guys go then. I think... we've talked enough. I'm just going to use this like I am. And once we get the process of the varnish thing rolling over, then I can just expose that number or whichever one gets over there first. It would be good to get them both over there. So that's all plot of mechanics, and then I'll just get a different number. Okay. Yeah, that's what we'll look toward. That's as soon as we get off here, I'm going to coordinate that with Matthew to see if we can get that all moving forward. Because I won't miss anything, and all my calls that would be inbound and my other one are all going to go straight to Quo. Everything will be in, yeah, everything will be in Quo. All those phone numbers, whether it be business or the number that's on your personal right now, all that stuff will go into Quo. One place. All I got to do is just hide my icon from my phone thing and just put this one up there. Yeah. And once we get that outbound thing going on, and then I can start calling from it, and all my calls will just go that way. … … I won't use my personal one unless I'm dealing with somebody personal, but nobody's going to have my numbers. So it would be easier for me to transition my personal contacts over to a different number than my business ones. Yeah, because you have such a smaller number of personal contacts. Yeah, and if they all still have my old number, they're not going to not be able to get a hold of me. So as they come in, I'll be able to transition them over whenever, and then they'll be fine. Yep, yep, plus you said you also have like stickers and stuff and pieces of paper floating out there all over the place that have your phone number on it somewhere. you want people to go get a hold of More like, yeah, every sticker I've put on a machine for the last two years has my cell phone number on it. Yep, and we want to make sure we retain that, so, yep. Oh yeah, for sure. And those two phone numbers, the one and that number is the only number that I've ever marketed or advertised besides that one I have in Jobber, which is causing confusion to people because they don't know. They're like, I got your cell phone number, your office number, this number, like I don't know what to call. In this case, like we could set it up to where it doesn't matter. whatever, we like call Call your number and get the same experience, or we can set it up so we're going get a different experience depending on which number they dial. So we can, you know, we can, we can work it however it works best for your business, for you. Well, no, I mean, let's just do the recording thing for now just to get going. And then as soon as we get the numbers ported over, we'll just bring the, we'll rerecord the prompts, how we want to have all that. And we'll build that out later. Yeah, exactly. Let's just get it over to where we have like feature parody all going through Quo.
ACTION ITEM: Install Quo on Alyssa's phone; train Alyssa to answer after 4 rings - WATCH: https://fathom.video/share/QaQrA5ztXaSzEH63m7HWY_pK_dJvhNLg?timestamp=7950.9999 Everything that you are currently experiencing. Let's just get it piping through Quo. Got it? Okay. That's what we're working on. Sounds good, man. We got you. Yeah. So when, just real quick. So like, if I go to the office right now and I have a listen and install Quo on our, well, I have Quo. I have her phone right now, actually. So if I install Quo here, it will basically ring with my phone when it rings. Yeah, it will ring in both places that that app is installed. Correct.

2:13:01 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
The only thing that we can't do is that if you have a user login, like Kelsey login, and then if she has it on her phone logged in as Kelsey, we can't control which device it goes to. We can only control that it goes to Kelsey login.

2:13:23 - Trent Christopher
Got it. It'll record the conversation whether she picks it up or I pick it up. Correct. Yeah. At this point in time, that is exactly what will happen. Yes. That's okay. That's perfect. Well, I'll put it on her phone and I'll say, look, if it rings four times, answer it. Yeah, that's fine. Go ahead and do that and just say that's a temporary situation.

2:13:42 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Yeah, for sure.

2:13:43 - Trent Christopher
Just so she knows, like, hey, this is how I'm going to explain to her what I'm doing with my phone number right now so that she understands that I'm going to put this app on her phone and I'll just, we'll practice it and I'll show her. And that way, if I can get to it or if I don't want to get to it when I see it come up, at least she can grab it. And then if I don't, and then I'll have. I've missed calling my log and I can be like, hey, what happened with so-and-so? Yep. There you go.

2:14:04 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
You have a way to follow up.

2:14:06 - Trent Christopher
I guess I'm going get an email with the conversation dictated to me or something or whatever. And then eventually, mean, we're going to, or pretty soon here probably, we're going to have Herbie a new user that's just under the same account. But I don't know if we're ready for that yet. Yeah, that's one thing at a time. I think all three of us. Go ahead. I think that the three of us are going to be a user, right? Or like, how much is a user? Let's see. So if you pay, I have to look at the website to remember that. It's like a per user cost per month? Yes, per user per month. If you pay yearly, it's $23 per user. course. But if you pay monthly, it's $33. It's $10 more if you, if you pay monthly, it's $10 more per user. So I can pay the full year up front. I can save a little bit of money. Correct, you save, yeah, you can pay 10 bucks per month. And then plus there's a $5. Do we need four users? It depends on how we use it. think right now we would need you, Alyssa, and Joe, but we don't need Nikki. We'll just forward the phone number to Nikki's number the way that it works now. Oh, got it. Okay, yeah, yeah. It doesn't require additional user for that. Yeah. Oh, perfect. Yeah, she doesn't need her conversations recorded, but I think the rest of us do. Yeah, if we need insight into the messages or the conversation, then we have to keep it as a user in quo, but if we can just hand it off to Nikki's phone number, you know, we don't have insight to her conversation, but if that's not needed, we can just forward it to her. Yeah, I don't think we need it for what we're trying to accomplish. mean, she's doing different things. Yeah, and if for some reason we find out later that we do need it, then we can always just do that. Right. So I think it's best to just, well, I think like, I'm, I think like having three users on, uh, clothes, like what I'm paying for Vonage, maybe I didn't look at what you're paying for Vonage, but maybe, um, let's see, I could find out. I think I'm paying like 50, 60 bucks a month for it at least. I'm still logged into it. I'm looking. Oh, that's what he says on there. Yeah. I don't, I don't see that stuff too much. Um, yeah, you're paying $47 a month.

2:16:28 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
looks like for, the one. Okay. Then that's not a big deal then. So yeah, I think let's do that. Let's, let's go ahead and set up, go ahead and set up three users and have it, Joe, Alyssa, and you that we want to just go ahead and do.

2:16:42 - Trent Christopher
Well, I don't know if we need the users yet. Like let's just get my user account set, um, register it. So it text messages and all that stuff. And then when you guys are ready to. Agreed. Well, once we port the number over, I think is when we'll get that all set up.

2:16:55 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Yep. I think that's a good idea. Let's, let's approach it that way. Let's get the first steps in place. And then And we'll, we'll move towards getting more users. Yep. Gotcha. Unless it's going to be more advantageous to set them all up at once, then we could just do it all at once and be done with it. It's easier. Well, yeah, we'll let you know. need it. Yep. We'll need it eventually. So let's, let's just, one step at a time here, but yeah, that's thinking ahead and we will, let's get your quo fully active and then we'll work towards. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And we'll see how the reporting works and stuff. Cause we might need to set them up with a phone line through quo, like a new number for them, but we'll, we'll look into it and we'll see how that works.

2:17:39 - Trent Christopher
Yep. Does quo work with like a landline too? Do they, you just gotta get a device or something and log into it or? Like a, what do you mean by a landline? Like a, like an actual. Well, I mean like a desk phone. Oh, maybe. So a desk phone, I'm actually going to a webinar in 20 minutes for this. So there's this guy who lives down the street from me, actually, who's in our network, who, like, has been on, he's been in the phone system business for, like, over 10 years.

2:18:11 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Yeah.

2:18:11 - Trent Christopher
So he was telling me a couple days ago that basically, like, if it's a phone, if it's a business desk, if it's, like, a desk phone, it's a landline, it's, like, a different thing. So it's kind of annoying. So he's, this webinar is, like, basically, he found a company that supposedly does that, so we're going to find out about that. Hey, so we may not even have to worry about that. I I don't need one.

2:18:37 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Yeah. I don't need a landline, just to, like, we're clear, like, everybody has a cell phone, so, like, I think it's more advantageous to not have a desk phone.

2:18:44 - Trent Christopher
Well, so, so FYI, just so everybody here on the call hears it, we can just, you know, Alyssa could answer on her computer if she has a speaker and a microphone. So, yeah. Before don't need a bill for sure. So you don't even need a physical. Got it. Okay. She's got to get her a nice headset. Yeah. She would just have to have a headset or something and plug it into her computer and she could answer phone calls all day long that way. Oh, okay. I didn't know that was an option. So either way, whatever, I'll figure out what makes it easier for her because it'd probably be easier than a cell phone. Yeah. I mean, it's really what, exactly. It's what makes it most efficient and easy for you guys to execute what you need to do during the day for your workload. If she needs to move around, if she needs to move around, she may not be able to fit attached to the computer. So that would be a thing too. But if she has, if she has wifi the whole time, can she just use her? Well, she, she would either answer on a phone or she would answer on the computer. The phone is mobile so she can walk around the shop, but the computer, she might physically be attached to it unless it's Bluetooth. Then maybe she can be mobile even more. Yeah, I mean, like, I think it would be, for her, it'd be good to have a phone like that because she's at a desk all day and that's where she sits.

2:20:10 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Me and Joe are running loose all the time. Yeah, so I mean, you can ask her to see what she thinks. Like, you know, she can answer phone calls that come in through Quo on the computer and she can have a Bluetooth headset that connects to the computer and she can still move around the office or the shop and be connected to it and talk to somebody on the computer.

2:20:30 - Trent Christopher
Or she has a phone like she has and she can use her personal phone with the Quo app installed without giving anybody her personal number. It would just be the Quo app installed, right? Yeah, And that might be a better way to go in the end anyway because she wouldn't have to carry two phones with her. I'll ask her about it. I don't want her to fill out. We need to put my on her thing or whatever. Hey, somebody's calling me, man. Hang on a second. From Quo. Hold on. Okay. Whoa. I got mute. Listen to that I can hardly hear it but that's like elevator music or something yeah on hold okay like the slack huddle music.

2:21:30 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Yeah it's kind of like slack huddle music exactly hey yeah yeah oh wait this is Trent oh hey Trent I don't know what happened to the other guy but he was calling me about a Canon 8100 plotter that he's having problems with okay I was trying to merge you guys in the call but I didn't know what to push okay but I hung up on him so I gotta call him back yeah call him back yeah make sure you service him just fine we we know what we're doing over here so we'll let you go Yeah All right. Thanks, man. Thanks. See ya. See ya. All right. So, yeah. So, there we are. We need to make sure that we're just working toward him getting him.

2:22:12 - Trent Christopher
He is satisfied so far with just getting all that. He wants to move. Like, he wants this to, like, move forward. Yeah. That's awesome, because we're going to get all the conversations now in quo transcribed so we can work with it and we can figure out use cases from there.

2:22:30 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
And we need to get it. We need to figure out. I mean, we have the ideas of how it integrates with the job or workflow, but.

2:22:37 - Trent Christopher
I've been trying to figure that part out, but yeah, it's like kind of sort of. Sorry. Continue what you're saying. I think I was.

2:22:47 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
I think I was just going to say we. Now.

2:22:50 - Trent Christopher
So now we'll have all the data like pretty much like that's that's the data that we're going to be working with. So we're going to have real data. So it's like.

2:23:00 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Okay, like, obviously, like, we want to start out just putting everything into a request so it doesn't, like, overwrite their, their stuff. Yeah. Right now I'm trying to figure out when to stop putting a new, like, a new phone call from the same contact. When do I stop putting those new calls inside of that request?

2:23:27 - Trent Christopher
I'm not sure when that is supposed to occur. Yeah, like, technically, if they call two years later and it's a new request, it's a new thing entirely, right? Yeah, would it be based on time or status of the request? Because there are statuses of the request that change. And that's what I was trying to work through while we were on the call here, was that right now I have a request that is archived. If it's archived, you shouldn't be adding any more notes to it. So, I mean, I wouldn't think that you would want to have an archived. Thank you. Thank Thank Yeah, so if Alyssa sees the request, updates the client or the job or whatever needs to happen, and then she archives the request, then the next time they call, what does it do? What's the behavior? it unarchive it? Well, I'm deciding the behavior right now, but what it currently does is that when I, if I send a request, okay, so I just triggered this call transcript completed to be redone, and what'll happen is it'll come over here and it will put in, it actually adds it to this archive, so one, two, three, four. So this right here was just added just now. Hold on. Oh, it's from top down, so it added this one, 1247 p.m. right here, so that's what time. So it's adding to the archived one, so it's not being conditional right now. Right now, it's just looking for a request to put it in. But what I'm trying to understand is that when you have a request that comes in, so I'm just going to delete this right now. I'll just get rid of it so it doesn't exist. So here's the stages that it goes through, trying to understand it. I'm going to trigger it again. And then, I do like how fast it is now that I have it integrated through N8N. It's like nice and fast. So here's a new request. It comes up in the request box. It shows a status new one minute ago. It matched a contact. It gave it a title called Quo Call Trent Christopher. Okay, so if I go into it, the details are on the right. There's no service details on the overview. I'm not really sure what I have to do with that or what I want to do with that. But on the right hand side, every time, if I do it again. What happens, like let's say the person calls back again, right now while we have a new status, what we're going to get is a second note. So now you can see there's two notes in here on the right. Yep. Okay. So it's adding notes to this. So now if I were to, let's see, the options you have to react or respond or process this is, you can schedule an assessment, you can convert to a quote or a job. So let's go through the big button because the big button is what I think they intend on you following. Yeah. Schedule assessment. And I'm going to say, well, let's schedule it later. I'm just going to leave it scheduled later and hit save.

2:26:48 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Okay.

2:26:48 - Trent Christopher
So now if we look at it, it says unscheduled status, but it will still attach notes. And unscheduled, but. Yeah. We probably still want notes at the unscheduled status. And then if I convert it to a quote, you got to attach a property, so that's fine. We'll just hit the quote is going to be a free assessment and hit save quote. So now what will happen is that now I have a quote in here that says it's a draft, but if I looked at the request status, because that's the primary thing I'm working with right now, it says it's been converted. So now I'm wondering if converted is a soon enough status to start creating new requests. But here's the thing is that we've just made it into a quote. So if somebody calls in and they have a question about the quote. So. So. Yeah, we would probably still want to capture that in the same. Yeah. I mean, converted isn't necessarily like fulfilled. So are there more options when you click the more? So I can convert it to a job, but let's go to the quote real quick and let's take the quote and let's do some, let's see what we can do with the quote. So the quote, you can convert to a job too. So you can go straight to a job from requests, or you can go quote, then job. So now I'm going to go to job. This is new quote to job. I call it that. And let's see, I'm just going to hit save job. So let's see what it does now. So this was today, job number four. So if I look at my jobs just to see if there's a status for the job, this is the today. It's this one here. It says it's today.

2:28:58 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
It doesn't say say um I guess that's the status is today. Yeah, it is. So let's go back to the quote real quick. The quote shows converted. So we converted the quote to a job.

2:29:13 - Trent Christopher
Taking note that when we look at new note, and we look at the on the right hand side, sorry, this is new quote, quote, on the right hand side, these are all the notes that are attached to the request. So like, if it comes in on a request, it stays attached to the quote. So if I were to do this again, right now, we've turned it into a job. And now they're calling you about the job, right? let's just say that's what they're doing. So now if I were to refresh this, you'll see that right now says 1249, but it should say like 52. If I refresh the page. Now it says 1252 and there's another phone call. Okay, and then this. but best. It doesn't tell you at all, like what stage it was at.

2:30:04 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
It just, it just gives you a transcript.

2:30:06 - Trent Christopher
It's not like, oh, like once it was at the quote stage, like it doesn't tag it with like, okay, quote stage.

2:30:13 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
And then it had this, you know what saying? No, it doesn't, but we could do that.

2:30:18 - Trent Christopher
Yeah. I mean, we could, we could tag it that way because right now I'm actually, I'm querying for a client to see if they exist. I'm searching for a request so that we can conditionalize it so that we can make a decision on if we add to an existing request or if we create a new request. Um, so we can see what the status is of the request right now and the status of the client, but we can't see, we don't have access to see what the job is. Like, um, so right now, if I go to the job, this is the job, the job has all the If we scroll down, you'll see all the notes. These are all the notes, okay? So these are the notes that are attached to the request. So they're all linked together, okay? Yeah, so the job knows what request it was to be able to get those notes. Correct. If I do it again, we'll get four on here, I'll show you. So if I just do this, and I trigger it again, and I go back to here, there's currently one, two, three.

2:31:28 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
But if I refresh, you'll see four.

2:31:32 - Trent Christopher
One, two, three, and four, okay? So there's four of them on here now. So it continues to add to the request, and it carries these notes all the way through from request to quote to job, which is awesome because it keeps it all together. Um, but now I'm trying to figure out when I go to requests, it's set as converted. That's the current status. But we don't want to stop adding notes at a converted status.

2:32:16 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
So let's move to the next stage. We have a job. It's today. We're going to move to the next phase of a job. We're going to, what should we do with the job?

2:32:27 - Trent Christopher
Close the job. So complete the job.

2:32:32 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
I'm closing the job. So now it says it requires invoicing. Now, what happens with the request? It's still converted. So it hasn't, the status of the request hasn't changed. The quote itself is converted. The job is now requires invoicing.

2:32:55 - Trent Christopher
So I feel like if it is a converted status. this you're to take break of Plstervous, blah, blah, That's button sinonesis down So we need to look elsewhere for the status whether it be a quote or a job. The actual status is requires invoicing for the whole chain. So yeah so that's it seems like once it's converted it I mean converted doesn't really tell us if it was converted to a quote or a job. Not in here it doesn't but it may show us something inside of the payload the message payload. Yeah but like so the this it kind of makes sense that the request doesn't keep track doesn't change state based on if the job changes state because the job keeps track of the state.

2:33:42 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
So as long as we can have access to whichever job it is we can check the state of the job by by querying the the job itself. Yeah exactly we would have to query if the request is converted. We need. We to know, is it in a quoting stage or is it in a job stage? If it's been converted to a job, we look at the job status, right? And then if we have a job, right now it says requires invoicing. So now if I create an invoice and I hit next step for the invoice and just following the flow they're making me go through and I hit save.

2:34:32 - Trent Christopher
So you can even see here. Thank you. Okay, I don't know what happened there. It's like Google logged me out or something, because it had me log back in to get back in here. Wow. Okay. Yeah. I was hoping nothing bad happened, but yeah. Yeah. I don't know. I was like, what the heck? I heard a noise, and then I was like, what the heck? I'm not even in the meeting anymore. Yeah. So. Should we jump to a new call?

2:35:52 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
I don't know. Like, we've kind of been on this one for a while.

2:35:55 - Trent Christopher
We have been on this one for a while. Let me just finish this flow real quick, because that way it's all together. for a see you next Let's Yes. Instead of segmenting it, so then, so now I can't see your screen anymore about that. Okay. Let me, let me share it real quick. Okay.

2:36:16 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
So now, all right. So now you should be able to see that this is the invoice. So I've created an invoice and now I'm, now I'm collecting payment.

2:36:26 - Trent Christopher
So the invoice is currently set up for awaiting payment. If I look at the job, what's the job status? Archived, it looked like. The job has been archived. I think that at that point, would we say that at that point, there's no need to continue? So which one, what caused it to go to archived? When I closed the job and invoiced it. So right now we're, we're awaiting payment. being bit. So I closed the job and invoiced, and then when I invoiced, I hit collect payment, and now I'm here to collect the payment. Yeah. Okay, so waiting payment. Yeah, I feel like, so at some point, it's, the request should be like, maybe converted is just like when it hands it off to the next thing, you know? To the next, yeah, the next object, right? The next object would be whether it's a quote or a job or an invoice, because if we go back and look at the job, the jobs are now, it's not converted, it's archived. Mm-hmm. So when a job becomes archived, that means no longer do you need, you're not making any more updates to the job, right? So I don't think, I feel like if we get to this stage, this status, can I reopen the job? Let's see, I can reopen it. What are the words? Let me see what happens when I reopen it. Yeah. So go to a job. So now the status of a job is now action required. Action required.

2:38:12 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
If I go to the request, I don't think it's changed.

2:38:16 - Trent Christopher
Nope, it's still converted. Quote, converted.

2:38:20 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Job, action required. Invoice, which I already invoiced for, it says it's a waiting payment. Oh, but I reopened it.

2:38:31 - Trent Christopher
So, oh, wait a minute. Hold on. Let make sure I'm doing the correct one.

2:38:35 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Oh, that might not be the correct one. Let's do this. It's number four, not number three.

2:38:40 - Trent Christopher
All right. Reopen job. Okay. So action required. Go back to the invoice. What's the invoice? Invoice says a waiting payment still. Job is action required. Quote is converted. So once it's converted, you don't don't do anything else with the quote itself, and you don't really do anything else with the request other than the fact that the notes for the request keep continuing through. Right. But so I'm trying to figure out. So now at this point, I wonder if it's the point. I mean, I wish we could just see all the states that are available, like for each object.

2:39:30 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Let's see.

2:39:31 - Trent Christopher
So developer center. Yeah, I'm trying to check the docs. Request basics. Now that's a help article. Developer center. Request. Request. Notes. Property. Request status. There's a request status.

2:39:59 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
So let me look at the. I'm status enum here real quick Are you in your IDE? I am in the developer.getjobber.com. Okay.

2:40:16 - Trent Christopher
One of the things is I haven't found a way that you can like find all of the reference information. For a jobber? Like not in a digital, like not in an accessible way for the agent, like for cloud code. Okay. So here's the stages. I found the enumeration. The enumeration is here. So it can be new, completed, converted. This is a request. Okay. It can be new, completed, converted, archived, upcoming, overdue, unscheduled, assessment completed, and today. Okay. So archived. So I wonder how the behavior is. If you call yourself again and it's not yet archived, like the request. Yeah. So here's the thing real quick. This is what I noticed. I know what you're getting at. Let me just go through this finalization of the job. The job itself, number four, needs to be closed. So I'm just going to finish this, close the job, and then it's got all the notes on it. And then if I go to the jobs, okay, jobs are both archived. The invoice itself is still awaiting payment. So I'm going to try to complete this out. If I go to request actually real quick, you'll see that it still says converted. So now let's go to invoices and close it. We're going to just finish it. And number two, collect payment and save. Okay, payment was recorded. Okay. So now if we look at invoices, we should see that it says it's paid. Okay. Yep. And then go back to the job just to see if it changed status. It's still archived. The quote going backwards still says converted. The request itself still says converted. So it seems like to me, why can't, when the job is completely finished, why can't it automatically archive these?

2:42:40 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
So the job is now archived, right? Yep.

2:42:44 - Trent Christopher
The job is archived, but the quote is still converted and the requests are still converted, but you can click on this and you can go in here and hit the dots and you can hit delete. That's not what I was thinking. That's You can archive it somehow, but how do you do that? So if I go here, oh wait a minute, if you hover over it, there's a quick thing. Convert to job, delete, request. I don't have a quick menu on this. Interesting. Delete. like you can have a status as archived, but I don't even see. What if you scroll down, so there's overviews, on-site assessment. Is there anywhere on there that's a line item?

2:43:44 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Nothing that can archive it.

2:43:47 - Trent Christopher
Yeah, but it says it's what it's used for. You can click on quote one or job four to get to them to see what they're used for.

2:43:56 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Assessment is unscheduled. That's the name. You can convert it, convert it. Print it and delete it. Obviously deleting it makes it go away, but I think let's do this real quick. Let's check something. So if I go to jobs and I go to number four, which is the latest one, we scroll down, we'll see the notes, right? And if you go to requests, if I delete the note, like ideally that would like happen on its own, but let's just see what happens to the job. Does it still have the notes? Are they gone? They're gone. So you can't, you can't delete the request and keep the notes. Yep. So it has to be either converted or archived.

2:44:55 - Trent Christopher
Maybe archived, just maybe delete it. It's like a special state or something where you can't manually do it, or there's some way to manually do it, we don't know, but it just gets converted after some period of time. So one way for Claude Code, it's interesting. So there's a GraphQL.

2:45:30 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
I think that's where they have most of their up-to-date fields and information.

2:45:38 - Trent Christopher
So I think if we hook up Claude Code to the GraphQL, that's going to be the way.

2:45:48 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Like to have Claude Code know about what's the latest API. Yeah, I have to like really connect it to the API, right, for it to really know.

2:45:58 - Trent Christopher
I've been like walking. I've been giving it screenshots and copying and pasting out of this developer this year. So is that the GraphQL or is that a docs? If you go into, so if you're in the developer portal here, like I'm just in manage apps, if you click the dots and click test in GraphQL, it brings you here and then you can click on this little book icon. And then it breaks down all of the different, yeah, this is what I saw before, they might have updated the interface a little bit. But what I want is I want reference to all of this in a way that Claude code can. Yeah, like, can we just, can we, is there a way to hook into the, that's what I was saying is like, is there a way to hook into the GraphQL with Claude code? Like, is there an API endpoint maybe that just has, are you going to support me? Yeah, I don't know. No, because that's what I was trying to figure out. Now, what I did do is I found in Claude code, or in Claude, I just was asking it, hey, I just said, hey, where can I get access to the GraphQL API details for implementation?

2:47:15 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
And it comes back and tells me, oh, go here. Well, this is the getting started, which doesn't really help me. That's just telling me, you can go here and tells me how to test it, which is what I was just showing you.

2:47:27 - Trent Christopher
Oh, wait, it says test GraphQL documentation. Yep. But you need to be logged in, it says, create a developer center account, which I did, test job account, I have, create an app I already did, access the schema. So accessing the schema requires you to click on the dots, like I just showed you, for the developer center to find it. You'll be redirected to a tool, yep, blah, blah, blah, which is how I did it. But here's the API endpoint. If you just go to this, it gives you a 404, so it doesn't, like, have a 404, Yeah, well, that's, so if you query the endpoint without authorization, that 404 is what happened. Yeah, but I'm, I mean, I'm logged in. Like, I mean, on this web page, I'm logged in.

2:48:16 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
But I wonder if we asked CloudCode to, like, find a way to hit this endpoint with our, with our authentication for our developer account, if it can find a way. I couldn't find in the docs that said you could do that, but it doesn't mean you can't. Like to get like the, like to get the documentation of the API through the API. You know what mean? Yeah. But it was like open API, right?

2:48:43 - Trent Christopher
Open API or Swagger.

2:48:45 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
You can go in and like, basically, it's a web page that shows you the entire API.

2:48:51 - Trent Christopher
Yeah. But, so here's what I do have. There's additional resources, GitHub template. This is a template that Jobber created. on we're that's intended on being an app template that has example code in it.

2:49:06 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
And I gave it to Claude.

2:49:08 - Trent Christopher
And once I gave that to Claude, it was able to fix stuff up for me. Okay, hold up. So I just found something. So if I actually, you can pull it up too. Can you pull up your developer? Sorry, you might have to go back and re-explain what you just told me because I was looking at this other thing. But if you go to your, what's it called?

2:49:30 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Your, the GraphQL. And then at the bottom, if you scroll down, you see this headers?

2:49:41 - Trent Christopher
You see those headers right there? Yeah. What if we just tell Claude code, like, hey, can you try using these headers and see if you can access the GraphQL endpoint? Oh, sure. I can see that. It doesn't give me a copy button.

2:49:55 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
So I'm just going to copy it.

2:49:59 - Trent Christopher
What if you have copy button. Right now, because I already have a chat window open with it, so if I give you the headers, can you see if you can hit this API endpoint and get the documentation? Just thinking on it. Because the browser needs to make a request, and it needs to be authored. yeah. So it's doing something.

2:50:44 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Did you give it the headers already? Yeah. Okay. Yep, I did. It's right up here. Here's the header. I mean, it's probably not, you know, best security practices. Bye. Oh, yeah.

2:50:57 - Trent Christopher
Bye. Yeah, it's it says it's querying the QL schema now for request create note input. So it's it's taking the context of our conversation that I've been having with it, and it's using the API now to get the schemas. So, yeah, I mean, I guess you can get the documentation. It's just a matter of giving it the header. Giving access to the token, it's able to go get it.

2:51:25 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Now I have everything. So would you be able to go out and get the entire schema and save it off so we have it cached?

2:51:36 - Trent Christopher
Or would it be best to just go ahead and query this each time you need it?

2:51:43 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
So we could yeah, we could have it do that.

2:51:47 - Trent Christopher
I mean, it might take a little while on some compute resources, but we could have it do that like every month and we just date the docs. So yeah, mean at the time that we get it, there's probably.

2:52:00 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
It's going to be a reference to the version, because there is a versioning system in the API. Right. Okay.

2:52:15 - Trent Christopher
Yeah, so it's trying to cache the full schema. Let me just see what it does. I'll let it sit here in the background while we're exploring this other situation here.

2:52:23 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
But anyway, so...

2:52:24 - Trent Christopher
It's probably going to just do the request schema, not everything else, is my guess. Yeah, right now it says fetch and save full job or QL schema. Oh, all right. It's what it says it's doing. And do you have it storing it in documents on your file system? It says schema saved in my docs. Yeah, it's job or graph QL schema. So, I don't know how big it is, but let's see if it says how big the file is. I think, yeah, ideally we'd have like one file for each API. Um, let's see. It's not actually that big. Oh, wait, yeah, it is. It's 992 kilobytes. So far. Well, yeah, it hasn't, um, it did it one time. I mean, it says it, but it's one megabyte, roughly one megabyte, it says. It says it's the whole thing. Huh. Okay. Yeah, mean, it's all text, so I can see, I can see that. Okay. Well, anyway, so I like it. So hopefully that just will help cache that. Um, so anyway, coming back to what job or the workflow was, right? Yeah. What did I have available here? Yeah. Okay, so I was looking to see if the automations would automatically do this or something, but it says notify update status, update status of archive, to archived, when quotes are actioned, when invoices are actioned, when they're paid, then add a tag, add a notify, I don't know. Now, the automations are pretty, very limited inside of Jobber, you get date passed, date arrives, so if date arrives, this time of day, in the morning, these, in quotes, invoices, invoices, are paid, then add a tag, so I mean, it's not even letting me complete it, or change anything, anything, like, you can't change the status.

2:55:02 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Okay, so those automations are pretty limited. If it's approved, if quotes are approved, then update status. You can update the status of a quote.

2:55:16 - Trent Christopher
You can archive a quote if it's approved or if it's sent. But that doesn't really help us with requests because we can only do quotes and invoices. Okay. So anyway, very limited in that regard. So I don't know if we need to build our own way of archiving that automatically. Regardless the way that Java works currently, requests stay open until you do something with them. If it says converted, we have to figure out when do we stop?

2:55:50 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
When do we stop putting it in the same request? And then what do we do with the request in the future? Right. Right. Right. Right. And like, If the job is still being completed or not done yet, or like, do we want new calls to be in new requests? Or do we want to, like, like, how do we want to handle it? Well, yeah, I mean, that's, that's what we need to, we don't really know yet, right? Yeah. I feel like once you've gotten to a certain stage of the, the chain, whatever that chain is, because you don't have to go to every step in the chain. Yeah.

2:56:35 - Trent Christopher
There's a certain stage in that chain that you don't want to put new notes on the request. Yeah. I don't know if those conditions are yet. Yeah. So we'll have, we'll out, we'll need to map out those conditions, see what Jobber does for us, uh, without us doing anything.

2:57:00 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Of course, which is what we're doing now. I'm trying to figure out how.

2:57:07 - Trent Christopher
So this workflow that you have right here, like, I think that it would be useful if we can share if you can share that. And then, like, how, how can we share like, I guess we can just share with each other whenever, like, whenever I build something, I can just. Well, what's the best way?

2:57:36 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Well, so one way, one way is that I can just, I can either export this as it as a snapshot, right? Yeah. That way. Or I can do this. I can say. Hey, Claude, do you have a copy of the workflow local that I can use for pushing up to get? Okay, so maybe in our Plotter Mechanics repository, we just keep the NNN JSON automations.

2:58:07 - Trent Christopher
So it has right here, QuotaJobber RequestJSON, which is the definition of that workflow. So we can get it, right? We can have it in a repo and you can go get it, right? So, right? So it says it contains a lot of NNN metadata, user info, versions, timestamps that isn't needed for version control.

2:58:31 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Let me create a clean get ready version of the workflow definition. I don't know if they need that.

2:58:37 - Trent Christopher
So it has like your user info, NNN metadata. I kind of think that might make sense. Versions, timestamps. Might be interesting to know versions and timestamps. It's changing the updated app, created app. Archive parameters. No, I think that's everything for the whole workflow on one line. Oh, you're right. That is. But it's getting rid of updated at, right? Because updated at is at the very beginning. Unless they just organize it to be later in the JSON. Okay, let's do this. So I got to tell Claude something.

2:59:23 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Do not modify anything that would break being able to deploy this in the future or import it in.

2:59:29 - Trent Christopher
From the UI. Okay, so. Okay, so it says the deployed workflow uses details in the request create input. So we wouldn't we Which we found doesn't exist in the API. The working version should use this and add a note mutation. Would you like to sync the local file with the latest working version? We need the latest working version in both places. So that's cool. So it already found a bug just from looking at the docs and then it fixed. So it knows how to fix it. Supposedly. Well, I think it already fixed the one that's in, in it's fetching from N8N. So let's see what it's doing.

3:00:50 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Okay. So it saved it to a local file. Okay. So the local file is here. It's now sync deployed. So it says it's got 17. It's given us a summary. So it's ready for Git and includes the metadata, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, but it's also safe to commit and will be overwritten on NextImportDeploy. Cool. Okay, so I have access to it and I can push it wherever, but right now this was my own repo and I don't even have it anywhere. It's local currently. I don't even have it in GitHub. But this is probably a lot of duplicate stuff, too. So I'm not really sure yet on that.

3:01:33 - Trent Christopher
Oh, I see. So your plotter mechanic, okay, it's not the same plotter mechanics one that I made. No, but we probably need to figure out a way to merge that so that we have the, we keep everything all together.

3:01:45 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Right.

3:01:46 - Trent Christopher
Right. So. So I did give you access. Okay, so I just checked you have access to the plotter mechanics one. I'm going to check the folder structure. So there's, I have the loop and plotter mechanics.

3:02:00 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Next, there's Docs with all the planning and stuff, and then there's Deliverables, which has Phase 1, Phase 2, Phase 3, Phase 4. Inside Phase 1 Deliverables, there's, like, Workflows, and there's, like, Notes to Jobber, List Jobber Clients, Text. There's a couple of different things, but there's nothing – I don't think there's anything N8N specific. So maybe it's going to be an easy merge. I can just, like, pull down whatever you have and take what makes sense to put it where it belongs and then push it.

3:02:41 - Trent Christopher
Yeah, I think that would be good.

3:02:45 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
I just started working in here because this was what I had local, Plotter Mechanics, to give any context or any good place to put it. So, but I also have – beside it, I have the N8N Nodes Jobber from Repo.
ACTION ITEM: Merge n8n workflows into Plotter Mechanics repo; push to GitHub - WATCH: https://fathom.video/share/QaQrA5ztXaSzEH63m7HWY_pK_dJvhNLg?timestamp=10979.9999

3:02:59 - Trent Christopher
Yeah. So that one's a separate repo.

3:03:02 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
don't want to add that to the plotter mechanics repo. Correct, it's separate.

3:03:05 - Trent Christopher
I just have two different folders that are inside my workspace here.

3:03:09 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Yeah, cool.

3:03:11 - Trent Christopher
Yeah, I think we can just get it. Do you think, I think that's probably best. We get it under the same plotter mechanics repository and then we can reorganize stuff as needed because the way mine is right now, the way that the current one is, it's just, it's not the best way, obviously, like, and as time goes by, we'll reorganize stuff. Yeah, so what is, so your repo, is it just plotter mechanics or is it like inside of your developer OS with everything? No, I pulled it out of the development OS to start like implementation.

3:03:48 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
So it's just called plotter-mechanics-linux. It's just like the name of your folder, actually. Okay.

3:03:59 - Trent Christopher
Thanks.

3:04:00 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
I can send you the link if that helps. Yeah, just send me the link that way I can jump straight to it since you've got it right in front of you. Okay, yeah, just send on WhatsApp. Yeah, I see it. I see it. Okay, so I can pull that down and then I can look at where I can put it and then I can push it right. But, so here's the thing, I still need to, like right now it's not conditional at all. So, I'm not sure if we need to modify this workflow so that it looks at the job and or quote statuses before it makes a decision. So, but anyway, we've been on this call for quite a while.

3:04:44 - Trent Christopher
Do we need to do anything to close out this particular call? Yeah, I mean, I feel like there's, I don't think so. There's just a lot of, I... A lot of moving pieces, I know. Yeah.

3:05:00 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Like, I kind of think that, like, we've, we've kind of stopped processing every meeting manually. And I don't think we're ready to do that yet. I think, I think after every meeting, we kind of need to go back in and make sure that the context gets to where it needs to be, at least like, we know it's all recorded, but it's not organized, like it hasn't, like, we could update several of the notion tasks with stuff from here. So it's not automated yet. So technically, we should do that manually.

3:05:31 - Trent Christopher
Like, so that's what I'm thinking. After this call, it's just like, the reason it doesn't get done is because we've been talking for so long. So as soon as I get off the call, at least, like, I want to take a break. Yeah, me too. I need to, I really should go to the gym. And right now is probably the best time for me to do that.

3:05:51 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Okay. Yeah. I can, you know, take calls or do whatever while I'm there, too. But, um, um, So I'll be, I'll be online, or like, I'm probably gonna take a little break, but then I'll be two hours from now, I'm gonna be offline for like an hour and a half, and then have another call from like, two to three. So I'll be back on like, I guess, 6pm your time after the next, I'll probably be on for an hour, one hour in the next two hours. And then back again at 6pm your time. Well, yeah, so I'll just leave it to you to figure out whatever it is you're going to do, right?

3:06:33 - Trent Christopher
Whatever you're going to do in that time. If you need me to, you need to get on a chat or a call or whatever, to work this out, I think for the next hour, I may not be able to sit at the computer, but I can take calls or messages. So, okay. Yep.

3:06:51 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Sounds good. I probably won't dive into like using the automation and stuff. So after 6pm, today, your time. Like, like, so you don't have to push it yet until I mean, obviously, whenever, whenever you want to, but there's, yeah, there's stuff. I want to get the meeting process and update my tasks before I understand what I'm doing next. And then I'll let you know, and like, if I think I need that, that you to push it at a certain time, but I don't necessarily need it right away. That's all I'm trying to say. Yeah, gotcha. Let me know if it becomes urgent. Right now I'm going to hold off for a second because I want to think through what to do with this. Cool. Maybe while at the gym, something I'll, I'll have an epiphany or something. So, yeah. All right. All right. I'm going to go do that. So let me know if you need anything. Right. Appreciate you bro. Yep. See ya.
