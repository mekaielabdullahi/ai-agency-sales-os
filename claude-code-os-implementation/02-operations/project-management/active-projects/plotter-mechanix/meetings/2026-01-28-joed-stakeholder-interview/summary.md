## Key Findings

### Joed is significantly more capable than assumed
- Self-taught on HP latex printers since 2013/2014 (12+ years)
- Handles 65-80% of service calls fully solo
- Only calls for help on ~20% of calls (true stuck), another 10-15% needs minor redirect
- Studies service manuals before jobs, notes page numbers for quick reference
- Uses ChatGPT daily for image enhancement, Illustrator shortcuts, and troubleshooting
- Has design skills (Adobe Illustrator 3/5, Flexi, Vinyl Master)
- Sees himself training others and growing the printing side of the business

### Training Time Validation (CRITICAL ROI DATA)
- **Initial 3 months:** Kelsey spent 20-30 hrs/week training Joed (~70% of time)
- **Current state:** Less than 10% of Kelsey's time (~2-4 hrs/week)
- **Proposal assumed:** 5 hrs/week -- this is close to current but trending down
- **Implication:** Training System ROI should model the NEXT tech's ramp, not Joed's current state. Joed is already mostly independent.

### Video Library -- Strong Validation
- "Definitely" would use it
- **Prefers video over in-person with Kelsey** -- Kelsey is fast-paced, video allows self-paced learning
- Also strongly endorsed flowchart/decision-tree format for troubleshooting
- Top content requests: parts replacement procedures, troubleshooting steps, post-repair service mode steps

### Chat Agent -- Validated
- Would use a phone-based query tool
- Top 3 queries: procedures on specific printers, troubleshooting steps, post-repair steps (service mode)
- Currently looks things up by: calling Alyssa, or remote desktop into office computer from phone
- Uses Jobber app + voice dictation for field notes

### AI Champion -- Strong Fit
- Already uses ChatGPT daily (image enhancement, shortcuts, questions)
- 8-9 out of 10 times gets good results
- Comfortable with technology -- does tech work at his church
- Adaptable and resourceful -- self-taught most of what he knows

## Daily Workflow (Detailed)

### Morning Routine (1.5-2 hours)
1. **Arrives 8-9 AM**, unlocks office, turns everything on
2. **Checks email for CAD print jobs** (~20 min)
   - Average 3 sets/day (30-120 pages per set)
   - Two consistent architectural clients: McDermott and Rouser
   - ~1 big batch per week per client
   - Flattening: 15-20 sec/page, printer does 30 pages/min
   - Fixed quality setting bug (high → medium, no visual difference, way faster)
   - File mismatch issue: 20 min to 3 hours to fix (happens ~20% of time)
3. **Checks Jobber for schedule** -- Alyssa usually has it prepped night before
4. **Cross-references Shopify for paper/ink deliveries**
   - Major friction: Shopify counts by BOX (2 rolls), Jobber counts by ROLL
   - Manual calculation causes under-delivery 2-3x/month
   - Each fix costs ~2 hours
   - Verification: 15-20 min per order
5. **Planning with Kelsey** -- changes 4 out of 5 days
   - Routes get adjusted based on last-minute service calls, experience level, geography
   - **This is the biggest frustration** -- waiting for agreement and coordination

### Service Calls
- Mix of HP maintenance, repairs, parts replacement, print quality issues
- Dispatched via Jobber
- Takes service manual + phone (remote desktop to office computer)
- Uses voice dictation for notes in Jobber
- Last-minute additions from Kelsey are common

### End of Day
- Returns to office
- Preps next-day print jobs
- Organizes for tomorrow

## Capability Assessment

### Comfortable With (Solo)
- HP/Latex printers (7-8 out of 10 service calls are HP)
- GravTech cutters
- General exterior maintenance and service
- Print head replacement
- Encoder strip and belt replacement
- Cartridge problems
- Print quality troubleshooting
- CAD architectural printing (full production workflow)

### NOT Comfortable With (Yet)
- Ink tubes and assemblies (margin for error, messy)
- Non-HP large format print heads (Muto, Mimaki, Epson)
- Solvent printer interfaces (different process)
- Flatbed / UV curable printers
- Two-person physical jobs (maintenance kit lifts)

### Escalation Pattern
- **10-15% of calls:** Minor redirect needed -- figures it out with service manual
- **20% of calls:** Truly stuck -- calls Kelsey
- **65-70% of calls:** Handles fully solo

## Tech Background

- **Family business:** Dad's print shop/sign business since 2013/2014
- **Self-taught:** HP latex printers, US Cutter, Vinyl Master software
- **Software:** Adobe Illustrator (3/5), Flexi (design + print files), Vinyl Master, ChatGPT
- **Design interest:** Wants to learn more Illustrator and Photoshop for printing side
- **Church tech:** Does technology work at his church -- comfortable with software and systems
- **No formal training/certifications** -- all hands-on and self-directed

---

## Equipment & Pre-Job Information

- **Wants to know before a job:** What printer/cutter, any other equipment on-site, software they use, what the business does
- **Current info source:** Jobber notes (sometimes incomplete), Alyssa, or customer directly
- **Service history:** NOT in Jobber -- has to ask Alyssa or customer
- **Equipment mismatch:** Sometimes Jobber lists one printer but customer has different/multiple printers
- **Field documentation:** Takes pictures of serial numbers, adds notes via voice dictation in Jobber
- **Status reports:** Agrees printer status pages (meter readings, print head life) would be very helpful to capture

## Shopify → Jobber Friction (Discovered)

This is a new pain point not previously identified:

| Issue | Detail |
|-------|--------|
| **Root cause** | Shopify counts paper by BOX (2 rolls), Jobber counts by ROLL |
| **Impact** | Under-deliveries 2-3x/month |
| **Fix time** | ~2 hours per incident (re-route or next-day delivery) |
| **Verification time** | 15-20 min per order (walk to warehouse, check stock, match to Jobber/Shopify) |
| **Annual cost estimate** | 2.5x/mo × 2 hrs × 12 mo × ~$50/hr = ~$3,000/year in wasted time |
| **Solution candidate** | Shopify → Jobber automation with unit conversion (Phase 2 email automation scope) |

---

## Kelsey Distraction Validation

- **During joint service calls:** Phone rings/deviations happen 80% of the time
- **Recovery time:** 3-5 minutes to get back on track each time
- **Joed's suggestion:** If Alyssa could be trained/trusted to handle more calls, Kelsey wouldn't need to pick up
- **Joed's observation:** Kelsey likes to answer new customer calls personally, but many could be handled by Alyssa

---

## Upsell Opportunities Identified by Joed

1. **Printing services:** Clients ask "do you guys print too?" on service calls. Kelsey sometimes says yes, sometimes declines (worried about competing with print shop clients). Joed thinks non-competing clients (tint shops, offices doing CAD) are missed revenue.
2. **Inks and supplies:** Already moving but could be much bigger
3. **Consumables awareness:** Kelsey may not be pricing in consumables (ink, print heads, maintenance kits) in CAD print pricing

## Solvent vs Latex Printer Context (Industry Intel)

| Type | Base | Service Complexity | Pricing Tier | Joed Comfort |
|------|------|--------------------|--------------|--------------|
| **Latex (HP)** | Water-based | More straightforward | Standard | High |
| **Solvent** | Oil-based | More fragile, more manual service | Premium | Low |
| **Eco-Solvent** | Safer oil-based | Mid-complexity | Mid-Premium | Low |
| **Flatbed / UV Curable** | UV light | Highest complexity | Top tier | None |

**Revenue implication:** Solvent and flatbed service commands premium pricing. As Joed learns these, Plotter Mechanix can charge more.

## Quotes Worth Noting

> **Joed on video vs in-person training:** "Watching a video, slightly more better for me, because I'm able to just take it in on my own time. Kelsey's more fast-paced."

> **Joed on troubleshooting:** "I'll go this or this and then out of that I'll make a yes or no and then I'll go to the next step. That's my process pretty much."

> **Joed on biggest frustration:** "The prepping in the morning and waiting for everybody... even if it's in my schedule, sometimes it'll change up. Four days out of five."

> **Chris post-interview:** "He is way more advanced than I thought. I knew he was good. But damn, he's good."

> **Mekaiel post-interview:** "What we identified with Joe is kind of what we already knew. Phase one training is going to be important... If he has somewhere to go and ask and get that last 10% from when he's stuck on his service calls."
