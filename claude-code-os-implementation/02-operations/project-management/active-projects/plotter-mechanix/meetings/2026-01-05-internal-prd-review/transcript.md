@Matthew Kerns [0:09]: If the morning.

@Trent [0:13]: Good morning. Good morning

@Matthew Kerns [0:17]: Get The painter's here today Coming soon

@Trent [0:20]: Yeah, so, yeah, Sierra, scheduled painters to be here to take care of a painting task that I've been putting off for quite some time. One of the things that I don't like doing is things around the house because I don't feel like it makes me any money, so she likes to come up with projects for me to do.

@Matthew Kerns [0:40]: Yeah

@Trent [0:40]: And then I, and then I procrastinate on them, which makes me feel bad that I take a long time to get it done, but at the same time I'm like, I'm trying to make the money so I could pay somebody else to do it.

@Matthew Kerns [0:51]: Yeah, yeah

@Trent [0:53]: So that's one of those to find balance in getting the things done

@Matthew Kerns [0:54]: Yeah, I get that

@Trent [0:57]: That I need to right now Even though I plan on in the future having the ability to be able to just pay somebody so that I can keep making money.

@Matthew Kerns [1:05]: Yup Yep, yep

@Trent [1:10]: So Hormozi talks about that a lot, but he's like As long as you have a little bit of money, he says, stop cooking food, stop getting groceries, just order it, DoorDash it, go get it. He's like, he, he's like, just stop that. If you can know that you can make money because you're spending time on something. He's like, stop

@Trent [1:31]: Wasting that time on cooking and cleaning.

@Matthew Kerns [1:35]: Yeah

@Trent [1:35]: I don't know, I don't know if I'm there, and I don't think Sierra would agree.

@Matthew Kerns [1:38]: And Yeah, same, yeah, cause I think Like, I don't know, I've gotten pretty efficient with the cooking now, where it's like, yesterday, I made like protein pancakes Eggs

@Matthew Kerns [1:56]: Like sausage. Ground beef

@Trent [2:00]: Mhm

@Matthew Kerns [2:01]: And all that in like 45 minutes and I was done. And it's like for

@Trent [2:05]: Yeah, but so did you make it?

@Matthew Kerns [2:06]: Will ask me like 4 days.

@Trent [2:08]: Was it only, was it only for that meal, or did you meal prep for the week?

@Matthew Kerns [2:12]: No, it's like for 4 days, it's like 12 eggs, 12 sausage.

@Trent [2:14]: Yes Boom.

@Matthew Kerns [2:17]: 1 pound of ground beef, which when I eat it with other stuff, it'll be good, and then pancakes, it's like two containers of them, so it's like 7 or 8 of them.

@Trent [2:24]: Yeah Yep. For me, that was the most efficient way for me to get what I needed was to do bulk meal prep, but the problem was I was spending like 2 hours or more on like Sundays Making my meals

@Trent [2:40]: And then I also had a problem where I was trying to feed other people

@Matthew Kerns [2:41]: Yeah

@Trent [2:44]: And they didn't always like the things that I made, and then, like my youngest son, he does not like to reheat stuff in the microwave. Or, or whatever, he doesn't like to reheat things, so, He's difficult to please

@Matthew Kerns [2:58]: Yeah. Yeah, sounds, sounds like it, but a lot of people are like that, But It, yeah, I don't, luckily, I don't mind that. So if it's like

@Trent [3:10]: No, me either

@Matthew Kerns [3:11]: I could just have food in the fridge, I can heat up, and I can have it in seconds, and I don't have to wait for delivery, like it also delivery costs like way more, but yeah.

@Trent [3:14]: Yep Right now. Yeah, I know. That's like, that's That's one of those things that like Hormozi says to do that, But I'm like, well, I'm not at that point where I can do that right now. So,

@Trent [3:31]: You know,

@Matthew Kerns [3:33]: Yeah.

@Trent [3:33]: The meal prep thing, I think Sierra would like to do the meal prep, but she's so busy too that Like we cooks a little like a couple times during the week, I absolutely hate it. I really don't like it because we take so much time cooking, and then we take so much time cleaning that I'm just like, oh

@Trent [3:52]: I just don't wanna do it

@Matthew Kerns [3:52]: Yeah

@Trent [3:53]: But she wants to do it, so.

@Matthew Kerns [3:53]: I know Yeah, OK, well, if he wants to do it.

@Trent [3:58]: So anyway Well, the problem is, is that I can't escape it So if she wants to do it, I need the help. So I need to help clean up or something. Like she'll make dinner and then I clean up. But

@Matthew Kerns [4:15]: Right

@Trent [4:16]: It, it is what it is. So right now, that's just where we're at.

@Matthew Kerns [4:19]: Yeah.

@Trent [4:20]: So

@Matthew Kerns [4:20]: Yeah, I'm trying to find these Investigations. Oh, they're in the other one, OK. Cause so I wanted to review this with you. There's like So if you can see in the Slack channel, while I'm looking for this if you want, but there's an update to the PRD, so McHale made a PRD for plotter mechanics, and then

@Trent [4:44]: Yeah.

@Matthew Kerns [4:45]: I put some comments on there cause they had, there was like email automation, which I don't think we're gonna deliver phase one, so

@Trent [4:53]: Yeah, I don't think that's gonna, I don't think that's gonna happen the first phase or whatever.

@Matthew Kerns [4:54]: You know there's Yeah

@Trent [4:59]: I think we need to focus on quo and Joer and refining that process.

@Matthew Kerns [5:00]: Exactly Yeah So the one thing about quo is that we need to understand the costs. But actually before

@Trent [5:16]: Well, you all signed up for it. I mean, he's already, he's already put his credit card in and everything.

@Matthew Kerns [5:23]: Right. So, but the, the costs of SOA, so I don't think he's, he's not using Sona yet, and I think Sona costs $1 per call.

@Trent [5:41]: Outbound calls. I was looking at that pricing table And yeah, Sonos Yeah, go to the, yeah, pricing there

@Matthew Kerns [5:50]: Yeah, let's see So these are So there's, it's a credit system. So I guess if there's a longer call, probably use more credits.

@Matthew Kerns [6:09]: Let me see

@Trent [6:11]: But what's a call? Let's define a call somehow. Does it talk about what a call is? Think of credits like phone minutes. You choose a bundle that fits your business business if business gets busier, you can move up instantly. OK, so every workspace starts with 1000 credits, which is 10 calls each month, no setup needed. So no we use credits for the answers calls. So it's answering the calls. So it's inbound calls that SONA answers. We don't even have to use sonar.

@Trent [6:39]: If we don't want It's really if you want to have a voice agent that answers the call.

@Matthew Kerns [6:41]: Mhm.

@Trent [6:44]: We can do routing without using sonar.

@Matthew Kerns [6:45]: Right

@Trent [6:48]: So like the traditional routing that he's doing right now. Like where they a number Sorry, it Gets into the system and then it has a menu system that you can route the call based on that, to go to some other Phone number. You can do that without sonar. but if we wanna add the functionality of

@Trent [7:10]: Answering the call, yes, it's gonna increase. Per call to call or not, OK.

@Matthew Kerns [7:16]: Yeah And, and that, but that will save him time from doing the talking, but we also need to refine that script, to make sure we set up the voice agent right. And then

@Matthew Kerns [7:33]: So like the other So, so quick question about the routing.

@Trent [7:39]: Yeah

@Matthew Kerns [7:41]: So once Right now, it's Vonage is doing that routing, so Once we start the porting process, right, then it'll move to quo.

@Trent [7:47]: Oh. When we start the porting process, it takes that 5 to 30 days to to transition from bondage to quo.

@Matthew Kerns [7:53]: Yeah Mhm.

@Trent [8:01]: But you're supposed to be getting email updates that you, you know, the stage or the status that the, the porting process is in. So my understanding is it will tell you

@Matthew Kerns [8:02]: We, we still start

@Trent [8:14]: It will tell you Hey, here's the stage we're in, whatever they call the stages. And you're scheduled to have your, your Port completion on this date.

@Matthew Kerns [8:27]: Mhm

@Trent [8:28]: So you'll know ahead of time when it's gonna switch over. But at the same time, you don't have control over when it happens.

@Matthew Kerns [8:35]: So it's gotta be ready The new system has to be ready before, like, long before the

@Trent [8:40]: Bingo.

@Matthew Kerns [8:42]: The expected time.

@Trent [8:44]: Well, so if we, if we start the porting process today We have a minimum of this week to get it done. But a maximum of this month But we don't know when that will be, right? So, There's no

@Trent [9:01]: Guarantee on that So if you go, if you to understand it better, there's a section in this quo documentation that talks about number porting. So if you scroll up, I think,

@Matthew Kerns [9:03]: So like if it

@Trent [9:14]: Oh sorry, yeah, there you go. What is porting? That's fine. Or how long does porting usually take? Well, that's fine. You just go in here.

@Matthew Kerns [9:25]: So On the port date your number becomes available in your account. After successful porting, make sure your subscription's canceled, some carriers automatically cancel subscriptions. Before you transfer. We need to know

@Matthew Kerns [9:42]: Only call an SMS functions transfer with your number. Carrier registration doesn't continue from previous providers, internet or bundle services tied to the number won't transfer previous conversations and call history don't carry over. OK.

@Matthew Kerns [10:01]: So I wonder about the call history, if that's Gonna be something we need to export from bondage.

@Trent [10:06]: I don't It Maybe

@Matthew Kerns [10:13]: Like just

@Trent [10:13]: Right now, right now, he currently probably doesn't use it at all. So if we don't do anything, I don't think there's anything lost on his end, but if we believe it to be important for our process, Then we should export it. But I don't know if that's important right now, because all it's gonna show is that phone number forwarded in to the menu system and then they, it like, maybe it would show

@Matthew Kerns [10:27]: But

@Trent [10:39]: The history of menu selection Like how often One Menu selection is being used, like what the most frequent. Routing

@Matthew Kerns [10:54]: Yeah, and, and we have access to varnish, so we can look that stuff up, I believe, until it gets canceled, but,

@Trent [10:55]: This, right Yes, correct

@Matthew Kerns [11:04]: OK.

@Trent [11:07]: We have to talk to, every time we log into Vonage, it sends a text code or whatever to Kelsey, so we just have to let him know ahead of time.

@Matthew Kerns [11:16]: Mhm

@Trent [11:17]: Before we log in

@Matthew Kerns [11:19]: OK. So, so there's gonna be some routing stuff. I wonder, maybe let's switch gears a little bit. And just look at this The PRD. I don't know if that's the one. This one

@Matthew Kerns [11:38]: Nope, not that one Cause there's a few use cases, So

@Trent [11:50]: I think at a minimum, we need to have the baseline features in place, to make, to make sure that the switch is Good. From quo or from bondage to quo. But we need to have a plan to have those in place, and then

@Matthew Kerns [12:01]: Yeah

@Trent [12:04]: That's the minimum

@Matthew Kerns [12:07]: Yeah

@Trent [12:07]: Extending upon that is where we start to Do our magic Right?

@Matthew Kerns [12:14]: Yeah OK, so we got to add to this, I think the the Vonage Well routing requirement. But so, Maybe if you have a few minutes still, let's review this.

@Trent [12:28]: Mhm

@Matthew Kerns [12:30]: So, OK, so

@Trent [12:30]: Yeah let's

@Matthew Kerns [12:32]: So plotter ops phase one is a communication control system. Transforms strawber into single source of truth. By automating capture of customer communication, calls and texts. We eliminate the manual handoff process that caused delays, information loss, and trust erosion.

@Matthew Kerns [12:50]: So first thing is not a good job or trust everything. I don't trust everything that's in there. Phone tag Daily handoff calls between Kelsey and Alyssa, right? So that's one of the main things because that takes time for both of them.

@Matthew Kerns [13:08]: Customers confused by multiple business numbers. So Target delivery 2 weeks

@Trent [13:14]: Yeah

@Matthew Kerns [13:16]: So the use cases, these are the We had a problem statement and I broke it out, made sure we broke it out into use cases, so internal handoffs is the big one. Current State Kelsey calls Alissa, calls her synchronous, interrupts both people. Melissa captured info on sticky notes. Info can get lost.

@Matthew Kerns [13:36]: Delayed jobber updates a road address in the system. I think that's, yeah, that's all. I just read that for the first time, that's good. Pain quantification.

@Trent [13:44]: So

@Matthew Kerns [13:46]: 4 to 6 interruptions per day, 30 minutes a day, plus plus, yeah, more than that, I bet.

@Trent [13:51]: Yeah, I feel like it's more probably more than 30 minutes, but yeah.

@Matthew Kerns [13:55]: Yeah So OK, multiple things come in. She takes notes on the call. She'll go update Jobber, but some of the stuff will get missed, and then it'll be back and forth.

@Trent [14:04]: OK

@Matthew Kerns [14:06]: So So there's a solution, that we, that I'm thinking of for that, that's Instead of Like, like, one way is like, Kelsey could call a a a number that's enabled by SoNA and that he talks through it with Sona, but there's also, but that will cost money, so.

@Trent [14:26]: Yeah, I wanna avoid that. Like if he's, if he's, you know, he sounds like he's gonna want to use

@Trent [14:26]: One thing

@Trent [14:32]: The ability to I would say like Have conversation with himself or spit out ideas or updates frequently.

@Matthew Kerns [14:47]: Mhm

@Trent [14:47]: Right? So I think that havingalsona sounds convenient because it would be A single point of intake.

@Matthew Kerns [14:56]: Mhm

@Trent [14:57]: It would be a concern for cost, and if he, if he's making internal phone calls, it doesn't sound like that's the right way to go.

@Matthew Kerns [15:05]: Yeah, cause he, he doesn't want to get interrupted by a phone agent either, I think, like, he's not gonna want to wait for the same recording like

@Trent [15:13]: Honestly, I don't know how we're gonna do it just yet, but he should be able to just open an app on his phone and just Talk to it somehow, and it automatically takes that information and sends it where it needs to go.

@Matthew Kerns [15:28]: Yeah, and that's something that I'm building an an app, but like, so Claude came up with this other solution that's basically like a voicemail only quo line. So Basically, it's saying that it's free, which is something that I wanted to research and validate, but like

@Matthew Kerns [15:49]: Basically, he'll just call this one phone number unquote, like maybe he'll make a call from one number to the other number.

@Trent [15:53]: Yeah.

@Matthew Kerns [15:57]: And then it just gets auto-transcribed, And it can go direct, we can wire it up to go directly to a job or request, and then, like, either our automation processes that to a client update or alyssa does.

@Trent [16:12]: Let's, let's investigate that. Let's also keep in our back pocket. That if we get him to switch to Claude or if we start looking at Chat GPT, he already uses ChatGBT So if we build an integration with ChatGPT where he can just talk to it and it sends that to

@Matthew Kerns [16:25]: Mhm.

@Trent [16:31]: Joer It, I know that like it's adding a third tool, but it could potentially reduce the friction and the time that it takes. For him to open his phone and press a button, like I'm just imagining I don't like dialing phone numbers.

@Trent [16:49]: I don't like doing it. So

@Matthew Kerns [16:51]: Yeah

@Trent [16:52]: If I have to pick up my phone, then I have to open up the the phone app, then I have to either have it as a a quick favorite. Which is fine But then I have to, you know, put it on speakerphone, or I have to put it up against my ear, and then I talked to it after it answers.

@Trent [17:10]: So there's like this

@Matthew Kerns [17:11]: Mhm.

@Trent [17:11]: Added layer of friction in there. That feels like it might take more time than if I were just to open up Claude And like I just two taps, and it's already listening to me.

@Matthew Kerns [17:26]: Yeah

@Trent [17:27]: So

@Matthew Kerns [17:27]: Is

@Trent [17:29]: I'm just, I guess I'm throwing out ideas. Let's, let's see what it's like for this voicemail only inbox because I like the idea of having a single point of intake. But at the same time

@Matthew Kerns [17:41]: Mhm.

@Trent [17:43]: It needs to be quick and easy because The way he currently functions is he'll call Alyssa and say, hey Alyssa, I need you to How's how's he doing that again? Like he said he would leave it on speakerphone or something, or he would What was he doing

@Trent [18:00]: Oh, he was transferring in. He was actually Doing a group call Like he would, he would ask Alyssa to join his call, and then he would just leave the phone on the hook, sitting off to the side while he continues doing whatever he's doing.

@Trent [18:17]: So that Alyssa could talk to a client.

@Matthew Kerns [18:18]: OK Oh So she would be, really, so she would be talking to the client.

@Trent [18:27]: Yeah, there was like the, the client would call Kelsey And he'd be like, hold on, let me get Alyssa on the line, and he would add her to the call. And then he'd say, OK, here's Alyssa, and then he would just set the phone off to the side and let Alyssa and the client talk.

@Matthew Kerns [18:42]: OK. Yeah, that's the kind of thing that like, I wanna know if Cause that's something that like Sona could do instead of Melissa needing to do it.

@Trent [18:52]: Right, that's something that Sona could help with, or at a minimum, when they call in, it gets routed to Alyssa instead of the Kelsey.

@Matthew Kerns [19:01]: Yeah

@Trent [19:05]: But yeah, we can eliminate Alyssa having to be involved there by using Sonar

@Matthew Kerns [19:11]: Yeah

@Trent [19:12]: I think stage one is just being able to route it appropriately. Stage 2 is let's put SONA in place of Alyssa handling it. So Alyssa can focus on higher value tasks.

@Matthew Kerns [19:25]: Yeah.

@Trent [19:25]: Not only that, but If Alyssa's the one having the conversation, who is putting the information in Jobber. Alyssa, or is the transcription gonna do it? I don't know.

@Matthew Kerns [19:39]: Yup So routing Then voicemail only quote line Alternative chat GBT Was, I'm not, I feel like I'm missing something.

@Matthew Kerns [19:56]: That we talked about I think just the pain quantification. OK. so So incoming client calls to Kelsey is going to be

@Matthew Kerns [20:15]: Yeah, I mean, we need some sort of like Intelligent Handling of Incoming client calls.

@Trent [20:27]: Yeah

@Matthew Kerns [20:27]: So, routing to Elissa

@Trent [20:31]: Or appropriate, right? Somehow we need to be able to route to the appropriate party, and that could be Joe, that could be Kelsey, that could be Alyssa.

@Matthew Kerns [20:41]: Yeah

@Trent [20:42]: Primarily the communications between Alyssa and Kelsey is what we need to Balance But Joe is also a possibility.

@Matthew Kerns [20:54]: Yeah OK Follow up Calls. Oh yeah, so there's like initial calls And then there's follow-up calls.

@Matthew Kerns [21:11]: That are like separate use cases. Cause An initial call will be, OK, this is just a request

@Trent [21:20]: Mhm.

@Matthew Kerns [21:20]: And a follow-up call. They should already have profile information, we need to figure out how do we identify if there's already profile. For them.

@Trent [21:29]: Mhm Yeah, so I'm imagining that uo will take a new phone number and store it. And my understanding is the way that it works is quo. Will pass off that contact info that it has to Jouber.

@Trent [21:50]: Jobber will have a new client that could just have a phone number attached to it and nothing else.

@Matthew Kerns [21:58]: Yeah

@Trent [21:59]: Ideally, Joer would be the one central point to store client info. But at the same time, Quo probably has abilities to route and handle calls based on the contact that's in the quo system.

@Trent [22:21]: And it's only a one-way sink. So Q will or quo will only send to Jouber, but it doesn't go the other way.

@Matthew Kerns [22:22]: Right Yeah

@Trent [22:32]: So we'll have to try this. Like these are things that if you want to take note, need to try out this scenario or something along those lines. Like, how does, how does the contact handling work? And can we route based on con contact? If it's a new contact versus an existing contact.

@Matthew Kerns [22:49]: Yeah

@Trent [22:52]: But my understanding is that if Jauber has that contact already existing The information from the phone call is attached to that client that already exists. Assuming the call from the same phone number.

@Matthew Kerns [23:06]: Yeah Right So there'll be some, like, if, if it's not all handled automatically, there would be some manual oversight that Alyssa still needs to do, but it'll just be like greatly reduced.

@Trent [23:24]: Yeah, the idea is that will automatically be routed and handled, end quote.

@Matthew Kerns [23:26]: You

@Trent [23:31]: The information is automatically recorded from quo into the requests box of Jobber.

@Matthew Kerns [23:39]: Yup

@Trent [23:41]: And then now they have to process it. Alyssa or Kelsey or Joe or anybody that works in Jober Needs the process the requests. Into the next stage, whatever that is, right? A quote or a service call or what, what have you.

@Matthew Kerns [23:54]: Yeah. Yeah. And then, We will also provide the SOP that goes with that. So like,

@Trent [24:06]: Yes

@Matthew Kerns [24:07]: You know, this is how you copy and paste this to ChatGBT. Copy and paste that, and then as soon as we have the automation set up where it we do we do that for them.

@Trent [24:17]: Yup

@Matthew Kerns [24:18]: It's a smooth transition, but they know how it works under the hood, that'd be good. Cause I'm trying to focus, make sure that we deliver quickly and we don't get hung up on edge cases too much that can just be like Like we should understand how it works, but they can level man.

@Trent [24:33]: Ideally, we capture 80% of what our goal is, right? 80% of the Calls or 80% of the communications we should try to shoot for being able to have A bulk of it taken care of. The edge cases we can spend more time on later.

@Matthew Kerns [24:52]: Yeah, yep, exactly.

@Trent [24:55]: As we discover them, because there will be a period of time where we didn't have the edge cases accounted for. And There will be room for capturing those And Determining how to respond or how to react.

@Matthew Kerns [25:14]: Yeah And that's kind of the risk too is that there's going to be something things that we thought were edge cases that are actually like really annoying for them, so we don't want to make the experience worse after we deliver phase one. That's something we need to plan for.

@Trent [25:30]: I I would put high emphasis on that, that we don't want to make anything Worse.

@Matthew Kerns [25:38]: Yeah

@Trent [25:39]: From their perception, if things are worse, they don't want us to continue doing things.

@Matthew Kerns [25:45]: Yeah, and that's like, yeah, that can be just the single point of failure really.

@Trent [25:50]: Exactly. So we need to make sure that things Even if they have to change their process, which is going to have a little bit of friction and may have the perception of this is worse. We need to show them how it's better. As long as we can show them how it's better, I think it'll be fine.

@Matthew Kerns [26:10]: Yeah That's where like it's better probably to defer to manual. Updates Rather than They take a chance of making bad updates to like a client. Information thing

@Trent [26:27]: Yep, and I feel like right now, the way that it works between Quo and Joer how it all comes into the request box. That's sort of your staging area, your inbox, for manual processing. It's the next step that Alyssa has to take, but fortunately, the information follows along to the next stage, right?

@Matthew Kerns [26:36]: Mhm. Yeah Mhm. Yeah, I'll gets captured, and that's their information loss problem, basically solved.

@Trent [26:52]: Yes Yup. Yep. So the request is just like the inbox for all information of the business. And then they take action on it manually. Right now,

@Matthew Kerns [27:06]: Yeah Yeah And we can even maybe provide like Suggested updates I don't know how far along we can get with phase one, but Might be a good thing to just try it out.

@Matthew Kerns [27:22]: Getting started with

@Trent [27:24]: Doing what

@Matthew Kerns [27:26]: So like, if we can hook into client info on Jabber, we can try and provide suggested updates. They get sent to Elyssa. So that she

@Trent [27:38]: So I don't know who's calling me right now, but I'm gonna answer it real quick. Sorry, give me a sec.

@Matthew Kerns [27:47]: Yeah Is good

@Trent [29:25]: So In my, in my controls work, Like what I was doing Where I just came from

@Matthew Kerns [29:33]: Mhm.

@Trent [29:34]: Sometimes you're working with a device or software that you need to go and get the user manual. Or you need to download software to work with a device and configure it and set it up and program it and all that stuff.

@Matthew Kerns [29:40]: Mhm

@Trent [29:48]: This one particular manufacturer, Kentz. They tend to make a lot of things free. But it's behind your login. So you have to create a login and then you go and now you have access to the downloads.

@Trent [30:05]: Every time that I go and download something, a user manual, a data sheet, a piece of software They call me Within 24 hours.

@Matthew Kerns [30:15]: Mhm

@Trent [30:16]: To just say, hey, I saw you downloaded that manual. I just want to follow up, make sure that you have everything you need. And if you want to, I can stop by and help you out with that.

@Matthew Kerns [30:17]: Well Well That's cool

@Trent [30:29]: It's, I mean, it's cool. I get that they're their model, but it's annoying to me because I don't need a sales guy reaching out to me when all I had to do was download the manual, read it, and do my thing.

@Matthew Kerns [30:40]: Yeah.

@Trent [30:40]: So.

@Matthew Kerns [30:42]: Yeah

@Trent [30:43]: They do it every time, every time.

@Matthew Kerns [30:45]: Yeah, and you can't tell him to like, stop.

@Trent [30:48]: Like, like suppress the calls? No, it seems like they don't, like I've told them before, actually, I had one time where I went and downloaded some stuff, and I had 3 calls from 3 different people At the same company, Call me and follow up. And I had to tell the third person, I say, hey, listen, I know you're just a messenger, you're doing your job, like, but I told the last guy that I didn't need anything. Can you put a note on my account or something that you guys already followed up. I don't need any more phone calls.

@Matthew Kerns [31:19]: Yeah And he said no

@Trent [31:24]: Yeah, he said he's like, oh yeah, I apologize for that, and they, I mean, they're nice about it. It's just they have like probably an automated CRM system that when you download something it automatically puts it in a to do list for these these account managers to reach out.

@Matthew Kerns [31:39]: Yeah

@Trent [31:40]: I think the painter might be here

@Matthew Kerns [31:43]: OK, no worries. Yeah.

@Trent [31:44]: Yeah. Painters here

@Matthew Kerns [31:46]: We went through a lot, so this is perfect.

@Trent [31:46]: So Yeah, yeah, yeah Chippy

@Chris Andrade [31:52]: When I drink

@Matthew Kerns [31:53]: That

@Trent [31:54]: Not busy All right guys, I gotta jump off here for a little bit.

@Matthew Kerns [31:59]: All right, see you, Trent.

@Trent [32:00]: Let's see

@Chris Andrade [32:01]: Morning, buddy. Matt, what's up, dude

@Matthew Kerns [32:04]: That's yeah Dude, I've been talking, made a some good progress on plotter this morning, I think, so.

@Chris Andrade [32:07]: Talk now Oh yeah

@Matthew Kerns [32:14]: Mikhail had a copy of the PRD And he just updated with a new one, and then

@Chris Andrade [32:22]: What's the PRD

@Matthew Kerns [32:24]: So this is like the requirements document that's Basically, it's the handoff stage between sales and development. So, What we're thinking is, before development starts for any project, we want to have a product project requirements document.

@Matthew Kerns [32:45]: Created and like filled out with like details about, OK, these are the specific problems we're solving, and these are the prod solutions. It's just that the next more detailed step that is like right before what Chip talked about with like creating like user stories and like, now tasks, and then there's those tasks get.

@Matthew Kerns [33:11]: Development work done, or like, now it's like, OK, these internal handoffs, how are we solving this problem? So something that me and Trent just talked about was like, we can, one thing we can do is we can set up a voicemail only box, unquote, that Kelsey calls and leaves voicemail messages that automatically get put into Jobber a jobber request.

@Matthew Kerns [33:40]: So, that's one potential solution, but just having the use case laid out here, it's like, OK, now we can come up with potential solutions for this, like another one is he already uses ChatGBT, so maybe if we create a tool that integrates with Jawer

@Chris Andrade [33:41]: No

@Matthew Kerns [33:58]: And ChatGBT might be easier to use, we're, we want to consider all the possible solutions and figure out what's going to be easiest for them. What are the limitations once we look into it, and the, the technical side, like how does this actually work? So, so yeah, that's what a period is.

@Chris Andrade [34:18]: Nice. OK, that makes so much sense and it's so well laid out to, and then that leaves like no questions to be Left presumed, you know, which is nice.

@Matthew Kerns [34:30]: Yeah.
