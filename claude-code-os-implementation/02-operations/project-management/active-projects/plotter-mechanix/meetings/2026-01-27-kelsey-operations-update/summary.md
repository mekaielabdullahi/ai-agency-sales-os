# Summary: Kelsey Operations Update

**Meeting Date:** 2026-01-27

## Meeting Purpose

General operations update covering scaling, phone system, team collaboration, revenue growth, and supply chain challenges.

## Key Takeaways

- **Surging Demand:** Kelsey is handling 7+ daily service calls across Pinetop, Pace, Tucson, and Prescott - business momentum is accelerating.
- **Revenue Doubling Target:** Kelsey projects potential to double income this year, aiming to surpass his previous $1.7M peak without the prior overhead and theft problems.
- **Andrew Fully Delegated:** Supplies, sales, and customer follow-ups are now Andrew's domain, freeing Kelsey and Alyssa to focus on service.
- **New Phone System IVR:** Implementing segmented call routing (1=service, 2=supplies, 3=sales, 4=printing, 5=accounting) with fallback escalation and AI answering.
- **Steve Unavailable:** Key hire blocked by personal issues; pivoting to Michael Maloney (currently balancing full-time work + side contracting with Kelsey).
- **Market Tailwind:** Competitors (HP) facing supply chain issues and putting large clients on credit hold, driving demand to Kelsey's independent service.

## Topics

### Service Operations and Field Support

- Kelsey secured a used printer part for $1,200 to fix a broken print head, enabling faster turnaround on multiple jobs.
- Managing 7+ daily service calls across Pinetop, Pace, Tucson, and Prescott - service volume rising.
- Delegated supply management to Andrew (PlotterMechanics.com), freeing Kelsey and Alyssa for service calls.
- Service calls routed directly to Kelsey's cell first for quick response, with Alyssa as fallback.

### Phone System and Communication Workflow

- New IVR menu: Ext 1 (service), 2 (supplies), 3 (sales), 4 (printing projects), 5 (accounting).
- Calls ring designated staff first, then escalate to backups before voicemail - preserving high answer rates.
- AI answering planned as fallback after two unanswered rings to manage overflow cost-effectively.
- Outbound calls from office staff use unified office number; Kelsey keeps personal number for client trust.

### Team Collaboration and Tools

- Andrew received access to all phone inboxes and Jobber for independent quote/supply management.
- HelpWire introduced as free screen-sharing tool for cross-device collaboration (Mac/PC).
- Alyssa assisting Andrew with Jobber training and quote coordination.
- System naming conventions updated to reflect individual inbox ownership.

### Business Growth and Market Positioning

- Major rental company engagement for equipment training and new cutter installation.
- Revenue doubling target - aiming to surpass previous $1.7M peak.
- Strategic partnerships with trusted technicians (Joe, former employee) for overflow capacity.
- Positioning as Arizona's premier wide-format service center, capitalizing on competitor supply chain issues.

### Supply Chain and Staffing Challenges

- Large clients on credit hold due to manufacturer restrictions - driving demand for independent service.
- Steve unavailable (personal issues); pivoting to Michael Maloney as potential hire.
- Andrew's rare parts sourcing expertise critical for overcoming supply bottlenecks.
- Kelsey prioritizing delegation of supply/sales to Andrew to focus on high-value service work.

## Critical Design Constraints

### Kelsey's Dyslexia (UX Requirement)
Kelsey explicitly described difficulty learning new software on the fly: *"I can't learn on the fly with software I've never seen before. I can't even see the buttons on the screen."* This is a **hard design constraint** for any Phase 2 system -- interfaces must be voice-friendly, extremely simple, or conversational (chat agent). This validates the chat agent approach as an accessibility solution, not just an efficiency play.

### Payment Concern
Kelsey directly stated: *"I don't even know how I'm gonna pay you, but I will."* Cash flow is tight despite revenue growth. This validates the need for tiered pricing options with smaller upfront amounts.

## Quo Platform Buy-In

Kelsey is fully committed to Quo as his primary communication tool:
- *"I'm gonna set Quo as my default. Just not even use my cell phone. I'm gonna hide my call button from my cell phone."*
- Wants to use Siri voice texting to the office number for capturing ideas while driving -- further validates voice-first approach
- Proactively tells customers about call recording: *"It's really helpful for Alyssa to have all that information right in front of her."*

## Joe's Expanded Capabilities

Joe is more capable than previously assessed:
- Handled Apache Rental engagement alone -- cutter installation, software configuration, customer-facing interaction
- 10 years of experience with cutters (has one at home he's been running)
- Kelsey trusts him to handle customer-facing jobs independently
- Customer response: *"We got a Ferrari in here compared to what we had before"*

## Subcontractor Network

A scaling model is forming beyond W2 hires:
- Former Plotter Doctors employee handling overflow flatbed service jobs
- Michael Maloney: potential partner, currently balancing full-time work + side contracting with Kelsey, *"getting burned out"* -- may be ready to transition
- Steve is **permanently off the table** -- personal issues, not returning calls

## Case Study Opportunity

Kelsey volunteered to be a case study: *"I'm gonna be your commercial, dude."* High trust and satisfaction with the work so far. Plans to reference the transformation journey publicly.

## Action Items

### Kelsey
- [ ] Add Andrew as a user in the phone system and assign Quo number 7875 for supplies/sales
- [ ] Coordinate with Alyssa and Andrew on call routing with menu options and fallback voicemail
- [ ] Implement phone system fix to reduce call recording errors
- [ ] Communicate recording announcements during calls to customers
- [ ] Maintain personal cell for key outbound calls to preserve client relationships
- [ ] Provide Andrew and Alyssa with HelpWire screen-sharing instructions
- [ ] Continue delegating supply-related follow-ups and quotes to Andrew

### Andrew

- [ ] Collaborate with Alyssa to learn Jobber quoting and manage inbound supply/sales inquiries
- [ ] Source parts for large format equipment and support expanding service capabilities

### Alyssa

## Phase 2 Implications

This call provides critical context for Phase 2 scoping:

| Signal | Phase 2 Impact |
|--------|----------------|
| Revenue doubling target ($1.2M-$1.7M+) | Scaling infrastructure is MORE urgent, not less |
| 7+ daily service calls | Knowledge transfer bottleneck is real and growing |
| Andrew fully operational on supplies | Validates "support not replace" approach for supplies |
| Steve hire blocked; Michael Maloney as alternative | Training system ROI may change (different hire profile) |
| Market tailwind from competitor issues | Window of opportunity to scale - systems needed NOW |
| Phone system IVR being built | Phase 1 Quo integration needs to align with new routing |
| Kelsey's dyslexia | All interfaces MUST be voice-friendly / simple -- validates chat agent |
| Payment concern despite growth | Tiered pricing with smaller upfront amounts required |
| Quo adopted as default phone app | Strong platform buy-in -- Phase 2 can build on this foundation |
| Joe handled Apache Rental solo | More capable than assumed -- can take on customer-facing work |
| Kelsey wants to be case study | High trust signal -- leverage for credibility assets |
