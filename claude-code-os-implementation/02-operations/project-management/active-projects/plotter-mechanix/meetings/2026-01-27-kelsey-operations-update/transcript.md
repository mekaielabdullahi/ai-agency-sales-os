## Service Operations and Field Support (00:01)

The team is scaling field service capacity to handle increasing demand and complex equipment repairs efficiently.

- Kelsey secured a used printer part for $1,200 to fix a broken print head, enabling faster turnaround on multiple jobs in Pinetop, Pace, Tucson, and Prescott.
- He is actively managing at least seven service calls daily, balancing pickups and repairs across several locations, showing rising service volume.
- Kelsey delegated supply management to Andrew (PlotterMechanics.com), freeing himself and Alyssa to focus on service calls, with Andrew handling supplies, sales, and customer follow-ups.
- Service calls are routed directly to Kelsey's cell phone initially to maintain quick response times, with fallback to Alyssa, minimizing missed calls and boosting customer engagement.

---

## Phone System and Communication Workflow (07:35)

A new phone routing system is being implemented to improve call handling and customer service with clear segmentation by call type.

- The phone menu directs calls by purpose: extension 1 for service, 2 for supplies, 3 for sales, 4 for printing projects, and 5 for accounting, ensuring callers reach the right team efficiently (14:10).
- Calls first ring designated staff members, then escalate to backups before going to voicemail, preserving high answer rates and reducing lost opportunities (09:30).
- AI answering is planned as a fallback after two unanswered rings to manage overflow without incurring excessive charges, balancing cost and service quality (11:29).
- Outbound calls by office staff use a unified office number, while Kelsey's personal number remains distinct to uphold client trust and personal connection (16:43).

---

## Team Collaboration and Tools (20:34)

The team is enhancing collaboration through shared access to communication systems and workflow platforms to streamline operations.

- Andrew received access to all phone inboxes and Jobber, enabling him to independently manage quotes, supplies, and customer communications (23:11).
- HelpWire was introduced as a free screen-sharing tool compatible with both Mac and PC, addressing cross-device collaboration challenges between Kelsey, Andrew, and Alyssa (21:43).
- Alyssa will assist Andrew in learning Jobber and coordinating quote preparation, strengthening team efficiency and knowledge sharing (23:11).
- The system naming conventions were updated to reflect individual inbox ownership, enhancing clarity and accountability (20:34).

---

## Business Growth and Market Positioning (26:50)

Kelsey is experiencing a significant business turnaround with strong revenue growth and expanding service opportunities.

- Recent service calls include a major rental company requiring equipment training and new cutter installation, demonstrating growing client trust and complex job capability (26:50).
- Kelsey projects the potential to double income this year, aiming to surpass his previous business peak of $1.7 million without the overhead and theft problems faced before (29:55).
- Strategic partnerships with trusted technicians, like Joe and a former employee handling overflow service calls, support scaling without compromising quality or responsiveness (28:44).
- Kelsey envisions becoming Arizona's premier wide-format service center, capitalizing on supply chain shortages faced by competitors like HP to attract more clients (31:12).

---

## Supply Chain and Staffing Challenges (33:42)

The business faces supply chain constraints and staffing risks, driving strategic outsourcing and resource planning.

- Several large clients are on credit hold due to manufacturer restrictions, increasing demand for Kelsey's independent service offerings as an alternative (33:42).
- Key potential hire Steve is unavailable due to personal issues, prompting focus on Michael Maloney, who is currently balancing full-time work and side contracting with Kelsey (34:52).
- Andrew's expertise in sourcing rare parts, especially for large-format printers, is critical to overcoming supply bottlenecks and expanding service capabilities (34:52).
- Kelsey is prioritizing delegation of supply and sales operations to Andrew to focus on high-value service work and avoid lower-margin tasks (34:52).

Full Transcript:
I had an open. What we do is we schedule the calls and we unscheduled. And that way we can look at the map and see where they're at all over the state. And so I'm like, okay, I'll go there. I'll get the print head. I'll go to Pace and I had a job waiting there over the holidays. Then I'll go to Pinetop and I'll knock out these two calls. Well, and then I'm gonna go to Tucson with the printhead that I pick up and Prescott and go back around Tucson, do two jobs there. Well, yesterday alone, I got two more calls, dude. I got another one in Pinetop from one of my customers. The print heads broken. And as I'm sitting there with Alyssa going over all seven of them, because I got. 
I got back to the office late and I made Joe and her wait because I was like, I don't want to get there. I got a big day. Like, you guys gotta wait till 5:30 or 6. When I get there, you can help me load my truck up. I had a printer in the back of my truck. I picked up. That's a whole nother miracle, dude, that just plopped in my lap. I'm working on a machine. I can't figure it out. I go on offer up and I buy the same machine for 1200 bucks, dude. Just one part out of it costs that much? 
Yeah. 
Now I'm gonna be able to fix this other machine. And then as I'm sitting there packing up my. The phone rings and this guy from Pacific something. I saw him in the Prairie House. He's like, do you remember me, Kelsey? I go, yeah, dude, you make air. You make fuel tanks for airplanes in here in Prescott Valley by the airport. He's like, yeah, I had a paper jam yesterday and I can't get it figured out. Now my machine's down. You think when you think you get up here, I said, I'll be there tomorrow, dude. Later. Can you bring a set of cartridges with you? I was like, yep. And I've been talking to Andrew a lot more about supply stuff. 
Yeah. And how's that going? 
Basically, I'm gonna turn it over to him, bro, because I don't have time to mess with supplies, man. I. I got so much going on in the service arena that I can't. I cannot do it. And Alyssa can't do it either. So I just made Andrew an email. Andrew plottermechanics.com. I want to talk to you about the phone system. I don't I think we should add another line for him in California because he's going to be calling out on my behalf and following up on all my service calls and stuff that I do. 
Yeah. 
And any supplies or sales of equipment is going to go to him and he's going to handle all the crap and then come to me with that with the answer and help Alyssa figure out how to put it on the game. You know, I'm gonna let him into the system, bro, and teach him how to use what we're doing right now because he's excited about it. Actually, you know, he's literally the only. There's only one person in this entire world that I could think of that knows everything about supplies, and it's his ass, dude. And he's sitting there unemployed and doesn't need an income, doesn't even really want to get paid. He's like, dude. He's like, I did this back with Dan and ink bags back when I first met. He's like, let's not try and slice up the pie right now. 
There's no pie to slice. He's like, I'll work for free until we start seeing the results. And then, you know, we'll work it out. I'm down for that, dude. Like, he doesn't want to get paid unless we're making money. 
Yeah. 
Anything happens and then they don't really give a what happens after that. Like, I mean, I have gone through so much, bro, you wouldn't even believe it, man. In the last five years of trying to get people to help me. And I gave up about four months ago, and that's when God started actually doing things, man. 
Things started turning around for you, didn't they? Like, you just sort of like this. If nothing else, your mindset has shifted and some things have happened to give you signals that you're moving in the right direction. Right. 
Well, my mind shifted into my old ways, which is like when falls apart. Start to get high every day. So, like, I was smoking weed every day and I started this three week prayer thing and I was going there high every day. Like, when I met you, I was high. 
Yeah. 
So I went the first week getting high every day. The second week on Monday, I seen this lady that I. That I. That I known from like three years ago. She was at this, when we started this 21 days of prayer three years ago. She was there and she was praying for me because I was going through a bunch of crap. It's the reason I hadn't shaved in three Years. So when I saw that lady the second week, I go, hank. And I didn't remember her name, and I still forgot it. But I went over to her, I said, I apologize. I said, what's your name? She told me. I said, keep praying for me. She said, yeah, what do you need? And I said, well, I'm in bondage to marijuana, and I. I need to be a better leader for my son. 
I got a bunch of crazy stuff going on, my work, and I gotta get out of my life. She's like, no problem. Let's pray. We go in the back of the church, she prays over me. Dude, from that day forward, I couldn't get high, man. I would smoke weed, and I'd feel like I was gonna have anxiety attack. 
Yeah, yeah, yeah. That's what you're saying? Yeah. That's awesome. 
You know? 
Yeah. 
I mean, I was still. I was still smoking all week, but every time I got smoked, I felt crazy. And so on Sunday last week, I was like, all right, this last week, I'm gonna quit, you know? So on Sunday, I went to church. It was super motivational. I came home, I gave away all my weed. I. I went down to this black guy. I know that he's always smoking blunts. Like, he smokes blunts for breakfast. And so I went over to his house. I said, hey, bro, I got a gift for you. He's like, oh, yeah? What's that? I said, come on down to the house and I'll show you. 
I gave him, like, these big old bottles of weed because I got a contract with the weed distributor in Arizona, the biggest one, and they're putting plants all over the country, and they're just giving me handfuls of weed. Yeah, I just go in the dispenser. He's like, you spoke? I'm like, well, even if I don't, I know people that do, you know, I'm not going to turn down free weed. So just go in here. He's like, what do you want? You want vapes? You want this? You want some of these infused joints? I mean, just take whatever you want. Well, I'll just put my name on it. I was like, damn, dude. So I gave that guy all the weed. And then he's like. I said, I'm giving up weed, man. I said, for now, I gotta put it behind me. 
And I said, so you can have my pipe, my weed, my stash, my other stash, this stash, it's in my car. And I gave it all to him. And Then he's like, you want to smoke this with me? And he had this giant blind. I was like, all right, man. Farewell to the marijuana for now. So we smoked this big fat joint, dude. I could have smoked it, like, four times and gotten high, and I. And I didn't even get a buzz, dude. I was just sitting there in the car after I got done going, like, I think I'm gonna take on gardening because I need to have. I need a hobby. 
You need something to distract you from that, right? 
Yeah. So I took on gardening, and that's just been a journey, too, man. I went to the farmer's market. I met this old man, and then I met this lady on Facebook that I bought a lamp from, and I met her in my church parking lot yesterday, dude. And she's like, wow, this church is amazing. She's like, I haven't been here. It took me five minutes just to find you over here. I go, you go to church? She says, no, I haven't been to church since I got divorced. I was like, no, me neither. I mean, I know exactly where you're coming from. And she told me a little bit. We sat there in the parking lot for, like, 30, 40 minutes, just bullshitting and talking. It was just great, bro. 
Yeah. Yeah. That's awesome. 
That's awesome. Again, this morning, we start. We have a men's event every Tuesday. And as soon as I walked out, my text message working, dude. 
Yeah, that's awesome, man. I'm glad that's working. I was a little afraid that was gonna take, like, the whole week to. 
Push through, but better now because I'm having to, like, stop every time and go back. Now I'm just giving everybody my personal cell phone. 
Yeah. 
Get the call out. You know what I mean? So Andrew. I got him an email. Andrew, Applauder mechanics. I think I need to add another line for him. Right. Yeah. If. 
If you. If we need to route, like, for example, if we need to put, like, a menu or something or have an AI Agent answer, and then they. 
The. 
The caller, you know, says they need supplies for any reason, then we can direct it to Andrew. But to do that, he has to. 
Be a user and add another one. Or let's just keep the. The quote number they gave us. 
Yeah, that's fine. I can just give. I can just give that quo number to Andrew. The only caveat is that if anybody else has that number and they've been trying to contact it, we just have to determine if it should go straight to. Straight to Andrew or Still through a. 
Calling system, I think that every inbound call that comes through any of those phone numbers should go to the answering service and say, thank you for calling. Plier mechanics. How can you know, do you need service supplies? I don't know how the AI thing works, but maybe you can make it sound cool. But. And then if they say they want to buy something, sell something to us, or purchase supplies, it goes to a group where Alyssa andrew can answer it. That way it doesn't go to voicemail. 
Yeah. 
So, yeah, I mean, we can talk about it, but that's the way I would envision it. And then when it's a service, I would like it to go straight to my cell phone, dude. For right now, so I can keep feeling these calls. Because if we get. Once we get that recording thing going on, it's really helpful for Alyssa, dude, to have all that information right in front of her. It's helpful for everybody. 
Yeah. Yeah. That's awesome. I'm glad that, that's going to be helpful for people. So let's recap the. The call routing real quick. So if it's supplies, clearly that's going to go to Andrew, right? 
Yes. And then sales, he's gonna help me. So he's really smart, dude. He knows how to sell, and he knows how to tell customers whatever they need to hear, Man. I'm telling you what. I talked to him a couple times on a couple conversations on a conference with some of my clients, and I'm at total peace with him handling that. 100. 
So if we have a menu system, let's just like, if were to keep the idea simple for a second. If we have a menu system and they press 1 for supplies, what's going to happen? Is it going to go straight to Andrew? 
If you need printer or plotter service, dial number one, because that'll go straight to me. That's the most. That's straight to you. 
Okay. Yep. Straight to you. And then what would be next? 
If you have a supplies need, that's going to go to either Andrew or Andrew and then Alyssa. So if he doesn't grab it goes to her. So it doesn't really go to a voicemail. So I can take their information at least. 
Yep. 
If it's a sales call for equipment, it should go to Andrew and then me. 
Okay. 
Because if Andrew, then it will go to me and I can talk. But if Andrew receives it, he'll handle it and make sure it doesn't get okay. 
Okay. 
If you have an accounting Issue. It's going to go to Nikki. 
Okay. 
My wife. 
Yep. 
But she's not on the phone system yet, so I don't know if that's really that necessary at the moment. 
We can just forward it to her number like it was happening before. Like her personal number or her number that it was forwarding before. 
Yep. Forwarded to her with. With the originating caller id so she knows who's calling. 
Okay. 
And then I'm gonna try and get. Eventually, I think I'm gonna get her on quote, so that she can call out there, but she can use my account in the meantime. 
Yeah. 
So. So sales. So service, supplies and sales. And then if you need. If you have a printing need, it's gonna go to Joe. 
Okay. Okay, Joe. And then you. If Joe doesn't answer, it goes to you. Yeah, but the. The goal here is to avoid the voicemail as much as we can. But then the fallback will be voicemail. 
Yeah. Because you. And that's. That's really a lost art these days, dude. Is talking to a person. 
Yeah, yeah. So I'm with you. The. 
We. 
We'll have the fallback be voicemail if no one answers. But we'll try to see if we can at least do two layers of calling first. So, for example, it'll go to, you know, like you just mentioned it go to Joe, and Joe doesn't answer. It'll go to you. Then it can go to voicemail if. 
You don't answer, that's fine. And then voicemail, just say, you know, sorry, we're all on the phone right now, but if you leave a message, our AR reception is going to put you right at the top of the tier for the first phone call back. 
Okay. Yeah, we. I downloaded your audio from Vonage and I put that as your voicemail. So we can change it however you want. But that's what's currently in there. 
I mean, you can put that in there for now and just set it up that way. And then we can work on the AI thing later if you want, however. But I think doing that would be good. 
Yeah. So we have. We have two options for the calling side of stuff. We can either have AI do it, but you only get so many AI calls that it can answer before they start charging you more money. 
That's fine. Our goal is for the AI not to answer it, so. Well, what you're saying is if we make that. 
What about the menu, though? The menu? 
Yeah. That's what you're talking. Every call that you get, and it Answers you get charged after 20 calls or whatever. 
Yeah, exactly. There's going to be a certain number of calls that you'll get for free included with your plan, with the AI and we can use that. But if we put the AI as the front menu system, everything, every single call will be going through it. So you're going to hit that limit and you're going to start getting charged it. 
Okay, well, let's just put the recording up like we had it before, say and I'll record it if I need to. I just got to think about how I'm going to say it. But the one I had before was working. So you can just use it and just use those extensions. 
Okay. 
For service, two for supplies and three for sales. 
Okay. 
Four for printing and five for accounting. 
Okay. And then we could also have the AI be a fallback since you get so many calls that are included with your plan that instead of going to voicemail, it could potentially take the calls. 
Can we, can we answer, like, can we set it up to where it rings a certain amount of times before we answer it or once we turn that on, it has to go through that? 
Yeah, we can do it however you need it to. We can do so many rings and if you don't answer, then the AI answers. We can do that kind of work, that kind of stuff. 
Yeah, so, but, but we can't like initially just grab the phone before the recording comes on. 
Yeah. Yes, we can. I, I can put the AI agent wherever in the call flow we want. So if a caller comes in, if a call comes in, it can ring you and then if you don't answer, it can go to Alyssa. And if Alyssa doesn't answer, then we can pass it off to the AI. 
No, I think that we should just have it come straight to a voicemail. 
Okay. 
Just say, look, thank you for calling Plotter Mechanics. We specialize in wide format service and repair. Yeah, if you need service, you know, dial extension one. If you're needing supplies for your equipment, number two, if you want to purchase or sell a piece of equipment, dial extension 3 if you want to. If you have a project that you need help printing, number four. And if you got an accounting concern, a mini type number five. And then it goes to the groups that we discussed. So if they hit service, it goes to me and if I don't answer, it falls back to Alyssa. 
Yeah, yeah, that's, yeah, that's fine. We can do all of this. 
Okay. That's what I want. 
Yeah, we can do all of that. That's not a problem. So we'll. We'll field all the calls the best we can to give it at least two opportunities for people to answer and then fall back to voicemail. 
And can we toggle that initial recording off and on easily to where it just rings? And then if it doesn't answer, the AI receptionist gets it. Like, if we decide that, you know, like, it's going to ring all three of our phones or something like that because of us, like we're out of town or just whatever. Can we turn that off and on or no. 
Yeah, yeah. There's. There's ways that we can just. Like you can flip to, like, a vacation mode, or you can flip to. We can change it pretty easily. It's not. Yet. This isn't set in stone, so we can change it. 
I just wanted to know what the options were. So for right now, let's just do it the way we discussed. I think that'd be the best. And that way, all of our calls outbound. I want. I got a question for you, dude, because I'm getting confused a little bit looking at the inbox of 602-722-8932, and then 606-8844 or 5. I guess I don't really need to look at the main number. So I'm just trying to decide what should the outbound call show up as going out? Like, should we standardize it or should I continue to make people believe that they have my cell phone number? I think I should. 
I think it's fine. I mean, we can. Like, really, any number is fine. The caller ID should read this. Read the same name, but a different number, potentially, if you're calling out of a different one. But if you're. If you're calling. Kelsey, like, if you're calling from your. Your assigned phone number, they'll. We can still treat it the same as all the numbers, like, when they call in, regardless. Yeah. 
I'll keep it the way it is. So people just kind of think they're still texting my personal cell phone. 
Yeah. 
And it keeps that, like, personal relationship. But any outbound call coming from. From Andrew. Andrew's extension, or Alyssa's extension, as long as they don't pick from mine. Because I want them to be able to call for my cell phone sometimes, because that's the only time people will answer. Like, these guys will be like, okay, good collection. I make one phone call and they pick up the phone. 
Dude. Yeah. So, yeah, they can they could just pick your number if they're not getting a response on the other numbers. Yeah, I see what you're saying. Yeah. 
So I think let's just keep my 602 number kind of separated from the main one. But all outbound calls from everybody in the office. Joe, too. They'll be using the 606-845-Line out. 
Yeah. The office number that it's currently called office. So. Yeah. 
Yeah. And I'll. And I'll keep you. Now that my text message working, I'll go back to using. I'm gonna set quote as my default. Just not even use my cell phone. I'm gonna hide my call button from my cell phone. 
Yeah. 
Just put Quo where it used to be. And then the only thing I. The only way that it works then is if I talk to Siri and say, call somebody. It calls for my personal number. 
Oh, yeah. Yeah. 
And that's actually really helpful for me, like, when I'm driving, when I have an idea. So, like, can I send a Message to the 602-606-8845 number and be like, hey, Siri, send a message to work. And what do you want to say? And I say it, and it goes to a message to the work line. 
Yeah, I mean, you could text. Yeah, you could text that number, and it would go to that office number, and whoever. Whoever opens up that line in quo would see the message. 
Okay, well, that's what I want to do. So that way, when I have ideas in my head, I don't have to, like, stop and grab my phone or whatever. I can just be like, boom. Because I get thoughts that pop in my mind if I don't see, say something or do something, like, immediately. It's like butterfly every night. 
Yeah, Yeah. I mean, like, as if you were texting Alyssa. You could text the office number however you see fit. And it would. Yeah, and it would. 
Yeah, because. Yeah, because I'm going back and forth. I'm, like, sending her personal cell phone messages, then I'm sending them to the old office cell phone messages because I can't send them to Quo. But now I'm going to change that up to where. Send it. Send a message to the office or whatever, you know? 
Yeah. 
I'll just send my text message ideas and thoughts right to that. That way Andrew and Ellis can both read them. 
Yeah. Yeah. You can do that. Yeah, no problem. So you want me to try to get Andrew on here, like, soon or, like, right now? 
Like, I mean, he's. I just got I called my IT guy yesterday, and he already got his email set up. It's Andrew at Plotter Mechanics. And I set him up with a phone with an extension so that he can start following up on quotes and. And. And get into the phone system. 
And you want me to get him. You just want me to give him the quo number 7875? 
Sure. The one that they gave us when we signed up. 
Yeah. That was the very first number that when we had in quo. 
He can have that extension. And then maybe. I think that it would be advantageous for him to have his own supplies, communication with the people, and the text messages going to him and not Alyssa. What do you think? Because. But how would you differentiate that? You'd have to have a third number. Right. And then it won't matter because they're all filtering through the same thing. 
Well, they. So every phone number has its own, like, inbox of messages, so. Or calls. We can give the quo number to Andrew when I assign him, like, when I add him as a user, and he can just interact with people on that. I can just change the name. It says quo currently. I could change the name to be Andrew. Well, I mean, the. The caller ID to outside world will still be Plotter Mechanics. 
Yes, but it'll just be his number. 
Yeah, but what I'm saying is in quo. Right. Right now, the phone number is labeled quo. I could change that to be Andrew, and I can invite Andrew and basically give him. We can give him that number. 
Yeah. Just like Alyssa's. Alyssa's pink, I'm orange, andrew's yellow. 
Yeah, we can do that. Yeah, I see the hearts. Yeah, I see the hearts. Yeah. And we can do that. And we can still treat incoming calls the same way you and I just talked, regardless of what number they come in on. 
Perfect. That's exactly what I want. I didn't know that was an option. Thank you. 
Yeah. Yeah. So we can. We can set them up as individual, like, they can be. Have their own ability of being routed, or we can set them all up to be the same so that they all get handled exactly the same. 
All the inbound should be held the same way. But the outbound, like, once. Once Andrew starts to develop a relationship with people and all that, I want him to have his own inbox because it's going to get busy, and that way he can just manage that himself. 
Yeah. So Andrew at Plottermechanics. 
Right. 
So I can send him a. I can send him an email right now or an invite. 
Yeah, yeah. Send him one because he got his email hooked up last night. I'm pretty sure I haven't followed up with him, but I gave him all the information he was trying. Do you use a Mac or a PC, Trent? 
I'm using a Mac. 
So does Andrew, and I don't know about a Mac. So how can me andrew easily share screens? Because I need him and Alyssa to collaborate and be able to share monitors with each other. And I use a thing called something 1, 2, 3, and it doesn't work with Max. 
Oh, really? Okay. I was using on your computer when I was doing that the first day that were setting up. It's called Help Wire. Help Wire. H E L P W I R E. Yep. 
Is it a fee? 
No, it's free for now. I mean, I don't know if they're ever going to start charging, but it says specifically on here that it's free. 
So send me that information. Send that to Andrew. 
Okay. Yeah. 
And just give him a heads up what he's got to tell him. Like Kelsey said that you needed to be able to collaborate with a Mac and a PC. Because I was trying to do it the other day and I was. I had my iPad propped up on the TV monitor. You couldn't read. 
Yeah. So for Andrew. Super. Yeah, I'll send. I'll send that link to you guys your via email. Is that okay? 
Yeah, yeah. Okay. Send it to Alyssa too. 
Okay, Yep, I can do that. And then for Andrew, do I want to give him access to the office number, the Kelsey number and his own number or just his own number? 
I mean, I would give him access to all of it just so he can oversee what's happening with me and stuff. Yeah, I'm fine with it. Yeah. Right. 
Okay. 
Absolutely. 
Okay. Yeah, yeah, I will. 
I'm gonna send him an invite now in Jobber. So he has access to Jobber, but he doesn't know how to use it necessarily. But that's why I need Andrew. Alyssa knows Jobber really well, so I want her to spend some time with Andrew on the. Collaborating with each other on how they're gonna put these quotes together and stuff. 
Yeah, yeah, got it. Yeah, I sent him an invite, so he should just have it in his inbox@Andrew plottermechanics.com. Okay, perfect. So he should have that and then we can. I'm going to change the Quo number. The name of Quo is actually going to be Andrew. 
Perfect. 
Okay. The caller ID is still the same. Plotter Mechanics. Okay. But I just changed it in Quo. So that it shows up in quo as Andrew's number. 
Alyssa has access to all them inboxes too, right? 
Yep, yep. Everybody. Everybody that's in here right now, which are three people, right? So there's you, Alyssa, and then Andrew. Everybody has access to all the numbers. 
Okay, great. That's perfect. How's Chris doing? Dude, I haven't heard from him since he was going to the hospital last night. 
Yeah, he said it was mostly a scare. Like his. His step. His stepmother or something fell and then was unconscious. And they got her to the hospital and they said there was nothing major, was just mostly a scare, so. 
Cool. That's good. I was worried about my headphones yesterday and I haven't looked at my messages this morning yet. 
Yeah, he seems to be back online for today. I don't know. I haven't talked to him other than chat, like text message, but. 
Okay, cool. That's good. 
But yeah. Anything else? Kelsey, we're gonna get that fix put in today. That's gonna. I mean, the system is working okay. It just has a little quirk where it sometimes thinks you are the client. So we. We're supposed to put that fix in today. Matthew is. 
I was wondering. I never. Me and Chris were going to practice it over the weekend and we tried to. And it didn't work, so I never got to practice it. But I guess you got plenty of stuff to practice on with all the messages in there. 
Oh, there's tons of it. Yeah, yeah. 
So, I mean, so you're gonna implement that in there today and then it will not think that. I mean, so, yeah, that's going to extract the information better than it was before. 
Yes, exactly. Yeah, yeah. So it was mostly contact details. It was just trying. It was getting confused on the phone number that was calling. 
So I'm gonna. I'm gonna try and make this more clear to people when I'm talking. I'm just gonna tell them straight up, listen, this is being recorded to help my secretary. So I'm just going to ask you a series of questions, just answering. 
Yeah. 
One after another. And then I'll just try and I'll try and guide the conversation because people don't care that I'm recording the conversation and nobody cares. 
Yeah, yeah. And it's good practice for you to just tell them, hey, yeah, I'm recording this just so my secretary can help me. So. Right. So that's. That's good practice. 
Yeah, that's good. I like it. I like being in front of them anyways. I mean, I don't have nothing to hide. I want them to ask me how I'm doing it so I can give him your number. 
Yeah. Hell yeah. I appreciate that. Yeah. Yeah. 
So once we get this going, I mean, like, I'm like, so, like, excited about what's going on. I feel like I had this feeling a long time ago when Plotter Doctors was taken off and my old company was going downhill. But I took it and I became prideful with it, dude. And I took all the credit for myself. And like, this time I'm trying to stay humble through it because I know it's not because of me, just because of the way that God's been doing things. I mean. I mean, just like yesterday, dude, I didn't really have much going on. Too much. And I had a service call with this Apache Rental. It's a huge rental company. I sent Joe out there last week. He spent a couple hours out there, picked them up, got him working. 
They were all happy and they're like, can you send us back for training and, you know, give us a quote on these parts and stuff? And then Monday morning, the thing took a again and they really wanted to meet me, so I was like, all right, Joe, you go that way. I'm gonna run down and meet these guys and try and see if I can figure it out. But I don't know about the cutter they have. Joe's got this cheap ass 200 Chinese cutter at his house, and he's had the last 10 years to figure out how to run the software, you know what I mean? And I'm sitting there going like, I don't know how to do this. So anyways, I'm explaining to these guys about how everything works. And the guy. 
And I thought I was just talking to the crowd, but I was actually talking to the owner and he handed. He goes, hang on, don't even bother. He's like. He hands me the quote that Alyssa had sent him that morning. When I went over there, he's like, can you bring us the new cutter today? I was like, hell, yeah. It's only 20 minutes away. So I went back, picked it up, came back, dropped it off. And then I. Every time I try to do something, the IP was. They had to get involved. And then once they would get involved, they're just like clicking through a bunch of screens and. And I'm like, I don't learn like that, you know, Like, I can't learn on the fly with a software I've never seen before. I can't even See the buttons on the screen, dude? 
It's like my. My dyslexia is just like. And so I got all irritated. I started. I started getting irritated. I was like, you know what? Hang on a second. I called Joe. I said, joe, where are you at? He's like, I just got back to the shop. I said, come over here and fix this for me, dude. I gotta go. So I told. And I had called tech support and everything, said it'd be 30 minutes. So I said, hey, guys, I gotta call the tech support. They're gonna call back in 30 minutes. I'm gonna have Joe come here because I got places I gotta go. And I told the owner, I said, look, man, I said, I know how to fix. 
Fix all kind of hardware, but if you put me in front of a computer with some software that I've never seen before, I don't. I lose my mind. He's like, me, too, dude. So I said, we'll get you up and running today. So Joe went out there, got them all, too. Then they were just like. They were like, we got a Ferrari in here compared to what we had before. They're all gonna sound like a freaking trash compactor, dude. You know, mine's like. All you hear is the paper gliding through it. 
Yeah. 
And I bought that thing four months ago, dude, when I was trying to. The things that we're doing right now. I was doing this with these guys from my church, man, right, while they were hosing me, and everybody just left me to hang. And I ended up having this printer, dude. Just today, I sold the two printers that I got involved in when I was getting my ass kicked by these people. I got, I mean, like, nine, 500 bucks, dude. 
Dang. Nice. 
Joe's delivering one of them for me today that I wouldn't be able to do to go out of town. I'm doing a flatbed service call on a machine I've never even seen before, dude. And the only reason I'm doing that is because this guy called me wanting to sell his equipment. And that when he called, I said, you know, if you ever have any problems with anything else over there, call me. And so he said, hey, I got this big flatbed. The only company I can get to come work on is in California. I said, I got a guy that could be over there this weekend, probably if you're available. And it didn't work out for the weekend, but he's going out there today. 
And he used to work for me at Plotter Doctors, and he ran the service department until he started treating him like an. And he quit like maybe two years ago and went to work for another company. And I just collaborate and work with him now and I hire him on the side when it's over my head or something. So. Yeah, it's just crazy. It's so much is going on right now, Trent. Like, if it goes like this throughout the rest of the year, like, I could see how we could double our income. 
Yeah. Hell yeah. That's awesome, man. That's awesome. I'm. I feel like 2026 is going to be a good year for me too. So things have been moving in the right direction for me. So it's a. I mean, I've been. 
Through like the most tremendous year last year of a bunch of and mudsuckers, like, sucking off the side of me, and I still did over a hundred thousand dollars more than the year before in sales, you know, So I think if we double it this year, I mean, the highest I ever got my old business to was like 1.7. And I had like, you people working with me, dude. 
Yeah. 
And they were stealing from you. 
Holding you back. 
So. 
Yeah. Anyways, right on. 
I'm done talking. I know you're busy, man. I really appreciate what you're doing for me, Trent. I seriously do, man. I don't even know how I'm gonna pay you, but I will. 
I feel it, man. I feel it, you know, helping you out. And you're. You're definitely, you know, you're giving me. It's hard to explain, man. It's like you're. You're seeing new, I want to say hope. Like you have like a new found hope and you're reinvigorated in the business and that's. That's encouraging that, you know, the type of work that we're trying to do is. Is really. It's can be really helpful, you know, in many ways. 
Not. 
Not just like to help a problem in a business, but it can be helped, you know, on a personal level too. So. 
Yeah, and it can help other people, you know, Like, I mean, I'll be there, like, if it. When this becomes successful. Like, I'm gonna be. I'm gonna be like your commercial, dude. 
Hell yeah, man. Appreciate it. Appreciate it. Yeah. 
I'm serious, dude. You're gonna be like, hopefully Chris's video and how crazy my is right now. Because, like, I'm gonna be like, man, like a year ago I was like this and now I'm like that. You know, I can see it, dude. I Can see it coming. I, I see like, I see this business just exploding and blowing up my old one out of the water, dude. Like, especially like in this niche that I'm in. Like, I see that I'm gonna become Arizona's wide format premier service center and all the dealers are going to be coming to me for help, dude. That's where I'm going. 
Hell yeah. That's exactly where you want to be. 
Network of stuff that's not like it used to because things aren't like they used to be, dude. Like, you used to be able to hire somebody and they would be worth the. But nowadays people don't want to work on anything. They just want to play video games and use a computer. You know, like the mechanical, like guys that know how to make things fixed. And those guys are dying by the. It's not around, bro. 
Yep. Yeah, but you know this, I mean, yeah, I'm sitting in an advantageous place right now for AI, but all these people that just want to sit around and punch keys on their computer, they're going to struggle here in a couple years because AI is taking a lot of that work. So they're going to have to figure out how to do some physical work. 
I know if they can even find a place to do it. I know the robot's not doing it, man. 
Yeah, yeah. I mean, there's interesting challenges with trying to do physical work, automated that aren't, aren't present in the digital world. So, I mean, I'm very well aware of the physical world, automation, and it's difficult, it's hard. So, yeah, so it's going to be around a while. Like, your physical presence is required for what you do. That's going to be safe for quite a while. You don't have to worry about that. 
I'm in a good place. I feel like, you know, like, people need my services and like, dude, I was just talking to this company. Like, a buddy of mine does service and they're a huge organization. He's like, he was telling me, man, we're on credit hold. I can't get parts, we can't get equipment. HP cut us off. Like, I'm like, holy, man. Like, if that keeps going like that, my phone's gonna start blowing up even more, man. So I really am gonna have to find some people, man. The guy Steve that I talked about last week, he's off the table, bro. I Called him last week, and he hasn't returned my call since. Yeah, he's got some sort of personal problems in his life that I don't want to get involved in. 
Yeah. And people at this stage, they're supposed to be presenting themselves in the best light possible, and if this is the best light possible, you don't want to see the worst. So. 
No, dude, I already know. And I already know from history. Yeah, he's in bondage, dude. He's in bondage to some stuff, and I can't bring it around me, so I. There's somebody else. The only other person I really like is Michael Most. Maloney. And Michael Maloney is doing all the things that we're doing together on himself, man. He's a smart individual. So he's trying to figure out everything you're trying to do for me, he's trying to do on his own while he's fixing printers from another company full time and everything else. And he's gonna get. He's getting burned out. And I'm like, I just told him yesterday. I said, bro, I said, what would happen if you went to your company who's working like a dog, and said, you know what? I'm done working for you guys, but here's my phone number. 
You can contract with me, and I'll charge you X amount. And then you just become like me, and we become like the guy where these other companies come to for their support and service because we're not stealing their supplies, customers, you know, like, we're not really doing it. But did you see that giant picture of that printer I stood next to you? Yeah. 
Yeah. That is freaking awesome. 
Andrew says he could source things for that. I'm like, dude, I can't even get those. So he can. There's. There's so much meat on the bone from Andrew on of what? I'm just letting go to the wayside. That's why I'm ready to dive in. Just go for it. Because I'm not doing. I'm not gonna deal with it, bro. I can't. And it's not as lucrative as what I do for me, so. All right, man. I'm gonna call Andrew real quick and just kind of give him a heads up. What's going on? 
Yeah, it's fine. I went ahead and sent the link for the help wire for screen sharing, and I already sent him the invite for the quo. 
All right, I think we're good, man. Thank you. I already gave him access to all my inboxes too. Like, sales service supplies. That way he can watch that stuff, too. 
Right on. Right on. That's awesome. That's awesome. 
So. Okay. 
All right, man. Have a great day. 
Yes, you too. 
All right, see you.
