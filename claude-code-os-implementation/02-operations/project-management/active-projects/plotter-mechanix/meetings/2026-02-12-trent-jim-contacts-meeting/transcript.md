yeah, this is great.","startTime":"04:29","endTime":"04:30","speaker_name":"+1 480-***-**28","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Yep.","startTime":"04:30","endTime":"04:30","speaker_name":"+1 480-***-**28","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Yeah, perfect.","startTime":"04:30","endTime":"04:32","speaker_name":"Trent Christopher","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Hey Jim.","startTime":"04:32","endTime":"04:33","speaker_name":"Trent Christopher","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"All right.","startTime":"04:34","endTime":"04:34","speaker_name":"Trent Christopher","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"I might, I've been in meetings all freaking day so my brain is cooked.","startTime":"04:34","endTime":"04:39","speaker_name":"Trent Christopher","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Yeah, yeah.","startTime":"04:40","endTime":"04:42","speaker_name":"Trent Christopher","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So anyway, I'm Trent, I am working with the Rise group and I'm trying to help Kelsey out with some of his automations with his systems in his business and he told me that he's been working with you for quite a while on like the Outlook side of things like Microsoft Exchange.","startTime":"04:42","endTime":"04:59","speaker_name":"Trent Christopher","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"And he said that maybe I could have a chat with you just a little bit, see if you have any insight on what to do with a contact situation that we have currently.","startTime":"05:02","endTime":"05:10","speaker_name":"Trent Christopher","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Right.","startTime":"05:12","endTime":"05:12","speaker_name":"+1 480-***-**28","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So what I thought about this morning, thinking it over it, the Microsoft, you know, obviously has many levels of mailbox and access and you know, and their default product is you know, in the mailbox they do have a particular product or feature called the shared mailbox.","startTime":"05:13","endTime":"05:31","speaker_name":"+1 480-***-**28","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Yeah, the shared mailbox is an actual, just a non transmitting mailbox but it will receive email but has, it has you know like a calendar, it has contacts and back in the day Microsoft used to have this thing called public folders.","startTime":"05:31","endTime":"05:49","speaker_name":"+1 480-***-**28","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Yeah.","startTime":"05:49","endTime":"05:50","speaker_name":"Trent Christopher","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Which was the idea that, you know, so I, I, I kind of went to that this morning is maybe that would be the right process.","startTime":"05:50","endTime":"05:57","speaker_name":"+1 480-***-**28","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"I don't know.","startTime":"05:57","endTime":"05:58","speaker_name":"+1 480-***-**28","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"You know.","startTime":"05:58","endTime":"05:58","speaker_name":"+1 480-***-**28","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Well, it sounds like would that functionality be primarily just for email?","startTime":"05:58","endTime":"06:02","speaker_name":"Trent Christopher","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"They come into like one inbox so it's like a single inbo of having like five of them or something or whatever he has.","startTime":"06:02","endTime":"06:10","speaker_name":"Trent Christopher","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Well, the concept is that you know, for instance back in the day the idea of a public mailbox or public calendar, whatever that you know, people in Outlook would then have their own calendar.","startTime":"06:10","endTime":"06:23","speaker_name":"+1 480-***-**28","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"They could see the group calendar and then you, that calendar could be like, you know, labeled meeting room.","startTime":"06:24","endTime":"06:29","speaker_name":"+1 480-***-**28","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Right.","startTime":"06:30","endTime":"06:30","speaker_name":"+1 480-***-**28","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Or you know, because if you had a physical space and people are trying to book the meeting room, well that was one way you could do it collaboratively.","startTime":"06:30","endTime":"06:37","speaker_name":"+1 480-***-**28","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Right.","startTime":"06:37","endTime":"06:38","speaker_name":"+1 480-***-**28","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Yeah.","startTime":"06:38","endTime":"06:38","speaker_name":"Trent Christopher","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So that's one avenue I thought of.","startTime":"06:38","endTime":"06:42","speaker_name":"+1 480-***-**28","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"You know, Microsoft have SharePoint but SharePoint is really more around data and library.","startTime":"06:42","endTime":"06:48","speaker_name":"+1 480-***-**28","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Yeah.","startTime":"06:49","endTime":"06:50","speaker_name":"Trent Christopher","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"You know, document wise.","startTime":"06:50","endTime":"06:51","speaker_name":"+1 480-***-**28","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And I think the shared mailbox, you know, would be ideal because then in essence you know that you can Just take a mailbox.","startTime":"06:51","endTime":"07:01","speaker_name":"+1 480-***-**28","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Right.","startTime":"07:01","endTime":"07:01","speaker_name":"+1 480-***-**28","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"For instance.","startTime":"07:01","endTime":"07:02","speaker_name":"+1 480-***-**28","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"It doesn't have to be.","startTime":"07:02","endTime":"07:03","speaker_name":"+1 480-***-**28","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"The advantage of the shared mailbox is from Microsoft point of view, they don't charge.","startTime":"07:03","endTime":"07:07","speaker_name":"+1 480-***-**28","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Right?","startTime":"07:07","endTime":"07:08","speaker_name":"+1 480-***-**28","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Yeah.","startTime":"07:08","endTime":"07:08","speaker_name":"Trent Christopher","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So people that back in the day had exchange, they might have 30, 40 of these public folders that were email or contacts or whatever.","startTime":"07:08","endTime":"07:19","speaker_name":"+1 480-***-**28","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And now you migrate with Office365, and then, you know, somebody's like, well, it's a $300 a month just for public folders, you know, that is included.","startTime":"07:20","endTime":"07:28","speaker_name":"+1 480-***-**28","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"But I think that was their intent, was that, that was the transition was, oh, we'll give it to you for free.","startTime":"07:28","endTime":"07:34","speaker_name":"+1 480-***-**28","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Yeah, yeah.","startTime":"07:34","endTime":"07:35","speaker_name":"Trent Christopher","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So that sounds like that might be something that would help them with email more specifically than contacts.","startTime":"07:35","endTime":"07:43","speaker_name":"Trent Christopher","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Right.","startTime":"07:43","endTime":"07:43","speaker_name":"Trent Christopher","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Well, what I'm getting at is so you have the shared mailbox, but it's all that mailbox or that incident to create also has its own calendar and contacts.","startTime":"07:45","endTime":"07:56","speaker_name":"+1 480-***-**28","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"But my point being is you don't actually have to institute any sort of email in and out of it at all.","startTime":"07:56","endTime":"08:02","speaker_name":"+1 480-***-**28","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"It could just be, you know, this quote, unquote, shared mailbox, but the only data in it is contacts.","startTime":"08:03","endTime":"08:09","speaker_name":"+1 480-***-**28","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Got it, got it.","startTime":"08:09","endTime":"08:10","speaker_name":"Trent Christopher","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"I see what you're saying.","startTime":"08:10","endTime":"08:11","speaker_name":"Trent Christopher","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Yeah.","startTime":"08:11","endTime":"08:11","speaker_name":"Trent Christopher","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So that's sort of like a central shared resource which can be contacts, calendar, and email if you need to.","startTime":"08:11","endTime":"08:19","speaker_name":"Trent Christopher","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Right, right.","startTime":"08:19","endTime":"08:20","speaker_name":"+1 480-***-**28","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Comes in and then you could.","startTime":"08:21","endTime":"08:23","speaker_name":"Trent Christopher","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Can I connect to that?","startTime":"08:23","endTime":"08:24","speaker_name":"Trent Christopher","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Like, if I needed to use an automation like Power Automate or if I need to read the emails, is it sort of work the same way as any other Microsoft Exchange product does?","startTime":"08:24","endTime":"08:33","speaker_name":"Trent Christopher","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Yeah, pretty much.","startTime":"08:34","endTime":"08:36","speaker_name":"+1 480-***-**28","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"I mean, it's a depository.","startTime":"08:36","endTime":"08:37","speaker_name":"+1 480-***-**28","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Right, but that's basically Microsoft is.","startTime":"08:37","endTime":"08:39","speaker_name":"+1 480-***-**28","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Right, but you can attach all kinds of API.","startTime":"08:39","endTime":"08:43","speaker_name":"+1 480-***-**28","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Yeah, do that.","startTime":"08:43","endTime":"08:44","speaker_name":"+1 480-***-**28","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"You know what I mean?","startTime":"08:44","endTime":"08:45","speaker_name":"+1 480-***-**28","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And say, okay, here.","startTime":"08:45","endTime":"08:46","speaker_name":"+1 480-***-**28","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"You know, we wanted to function in such a way, and, you know, Microsoft's all geared up for that.","startTime":"08:46","endTime":"08:51","speaker_name":"+1 480-***-**28","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So, I mean, that's where I'm going to like.","startTime":"08:51","endTime":"08:54","speaker_name":"+1 480-***-**28","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"At one point, I did share mailboxes for Kelsey, but then he wanted to reply to email with the default.","startTime":"08:55","endTime":"09:03","speaker_name":"+1 480-***-**28","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Got it.","startTime":"09:03","endTime":"09:03","speaker_name":"Trent Christopher","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"You know, with the email address of the mailbox.","startTime":"09:03","endTime":"09:06","speaker_name":"+1 480-***-**28","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And I said, well, that defeats the purpose of a share mailbox.","startTime":"09:06","endTime":"09:09","speaker_name":"+1 480-***-**28","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So I ended up getting him, you know, paid prescription mailboxes, even though no one uses them, you know, on their phone or whatever.","startTime":"09:09","endTime":"09:17","speaker_name":"+1 480-***-**28","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"From their point of view, if somebody emails, you know, support, they're getting an email back from support, not from an individual.","startTime":"09:17","endTime":"09:25","speaker_name":"+1 480-***-**28","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Right, yeah.","startTime":"09:25","endTime":"09:26","speaker_name":"+1 480-***-**28","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Yeah.","startTime":"09:26","endTime":"09:26","speaker_name":"Trent Christopher","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So, yeah, if he.","startTime":"09:27","endTime":"09:29","speaker_name":"Trent Christopher","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So one of the problems or the primary issue here is that he has like 10,580 contacts on his cell phone.","startTime":"09:29","endTime":"09:37","speaker_name":"Trent Christopher","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"And then he has contacts in Outlook, has contacts in QuickBooks and in capsules.","startTime":"09:38","endTime":"09:44","speaker_name":"Trent Christopher","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"He's got in Jobber.","startTime":"09:45","endTime":"09:46","speaker_name":"Trent Christopher","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"He's got them in all these different places.","startTime":"09:46","endTime":"09:48","speaker_name":"Trent Christopher","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"And one of the problems is he kind of needs to have, I don't want to say all contacts.","startTime":"09:48","endTime":"09:54","speaker_name":"Trent Christopher","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"I just want to say he needs to have contacts that he's actively working with to be accessible everywhere.","startTime":"09:54","endTime":"10:00","speaker_name":"Trent Christopher","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So.","startTime":"10:02","endTime":"10:02","speaker_name":"Trent Christopher","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"And that's why I think that the Share contact might work, because as an example, and again, I'm just playing out ideas here is people open Outlook, they can see this in their Outlook, and they can literally copy to it, meaning they can add and subtract and if they can edit it themselves and therefore it's globally acceptable.","startTime":"10:02","endTime":"10:24","speaker_name":"+1 480-***-**28","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Yeah, yeah.","startTime":"10:24","endTime":"10:25","speaker_name":"Trent Christopher","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"And then we just have to be able to build the systems that can help synchronize those if they don't already exist.","startTime":"10:25","endTime":"10:29","speaker_name":"Trent Christopher","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So, like, absolutely.","startTime":"10:30","endTime":"10:31","speaker_name":"Trent Christopher","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"100%.","startTime":"10:32","endTime":"10:33","speaker_name":"+1 480-***-**28","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Yeah.","startTime":"10:33","endTime":"10:33","speaker_name":"+1 480-***-**28","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"100%.","startTime":"10:33","endTime":"10:34","speaker_name":"+1 480-***-**28","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Yep, yep.","startTime":"10:34","endTime":"10:34","speaker_name":"Trent Christopher","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So, yeah, I'm trying to figure out where the single source of truth is.","startTime":"10:34","endTime":"10:37","speaker_name":"Trent Christopher","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Like, what's the.","startTime":"10:37","endTime":"10:38","speaker_name":"Trent Christopher","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"The.","startTime":"10:38","endTime":"10:39","speaker_name":"Trent Christopher","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"The single most important contact repository.","startTime":"10:39","endTime":"10:44","speaker_name":"Trent Christopher","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"But right now they're just.","startTime":"10:44","endTime":"10:45","speaker_name":"Trent Christopher","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"It's scattered all over the place.","startTime":"10:45","endTime":"10:46","speaker_name":"Trent Christopher","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So we're trying to figure out how.","startTime":"10:46","endTime":"10:48","speaker_name":"Trent Christopher","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"That'S kind of like dealing with Kelsey in general.","startTime":"10:49","endTime":"10:51","speaker_name":"+1 480-***-**28","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"You know, he going on about, you know, on a scale of 1 to 10 into 11.","startTime":"10:51","endTime":"10:58","speaker_name":"+1 480-***-**28","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Yeah, I know the guy a lot.","startTime":"10:59","endTime":"11:00","speaker_name":"+1 480-***-**28","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"A long time.","startTime":"11:01","endTime":"11:01","speaker_name":"+1 480-***-**28","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"You know what I mean?","startTime":"11:01","endTime":"11:02","speaker_name":"+1 480-***-**28","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Like, he's all great with the idea, but the implementation, that's.","startTime":"11:02","endTime":"11:06","speaker_name":"+1 480-***-**28","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"That's not his demo.","startTime":"11:06","endTime":"11:07","speaker_name":"+1 480-***-**28","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Yeah, yeah, exactly.","startTime":"11:07","endTime":"11:09","speaker_name":"Trent Christopher","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"And he seems to know that, but he doesn't always know it when he's in the moment.","startTime":"11:09","endTime":"11:13","speaker_name":"Trent Christopher","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Right.","startTime":"11:16","endTime":"11:16","speaker_name":"+1 480-***-**28","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And passion takes over his lots.","startTime":"11:16","endTime":"11:18","speaker_name":"+1 480-***-**28","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Yes, exactly.","startTime":"11:18","endTime":"11:19","speaker_name":"Trent Christopher","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"He's very passionate about what he does, so.","startTime":"11:19","endTime":"11:21","speaker_name":"Trent Christopher","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"And that's.","startTime":"11:21","endTime":"11:21","speaker_name":"Trent Christopher","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"He just wants to keep moving.","startTime":"11:21","endTime":"11:23","speaker_name":"Trent Christopher","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Yeah, that's kind of.","startTime":"11:23","endTime":"11:26","speaker_name":"+1 480-***-**28","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Now, as an example, you know, the flip side could be, is you could establish this, right.","startTime":"11:26","endTime":"11:34","speaker_name":"+1 480-***-**28","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And then you could use third party.","startTime":"11:34","endTime":"11:36","speaker_name":"+1 480-***-**28","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"You then replicate those contacts into individual address books.","startTime":"11:36","endTime":"11:43","speaker_name":"+1 480-***-**28","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"You know, like again, I guess from a phone point of view, right.","startTime":"11:43","endTime":"11:48","speaker_name":"+1 480-***-**28","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"You know, Microsoft has their own app, you know, their Outlook app that has Contact, or I'm getting at, you know, you could use the third party to copy those out to go into his phone.","startTime":"11:49","endTime":"12:01","speaker_name":"+1 480-***-**28","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So every time somebody updates, you know, the contact in this shared box, it replicates something.","startTime":"12:01","endTime":"12:08","speaker_name":"+1 480-***-**28","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Would it be a good idea or possible to use the shared contact list as Kelsey's cell phone?","startTime":"12:10","endTime":"12:19","speaker_name":"Trent Christopher","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Like the contacts that they could link to Exchange and then synchronize the contacts back and forth using the shared list.","startTime":"12:19","endTime":"12:26","speaker_name":"Trent Christopher","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Yeah, yeah.","startTime":"12:26","endTime":"12:27","speaker_name":"+1 480-***-**28","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So.","startTime":"12:27","endTime":"12:28","speaker_name":"+1 480-***-**28","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So back in the day, like hundreds of years ago, so to speak, I set that up for him and I had a third party and that's what it did.","startTime":"12:28","endTime":"12:36","speaker_name":"+1 480-***-**28","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"The problem that he had, and you could probably understand it, he had so much duplication because in essence, nobody knew which one had the most relevant of accuracy.","startTime":"12:37","endTime":"12:52","speaker_name":"+1 480-***-**28","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Yeah.","startTime":"12:54","endTime":"12:54","speaker_name":"Trent Christopher","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"And that really starts off with having the correct data before you have the right mechanism.","startTime":"12:54","endTime":"12:59","speaker_name":"+1 480-***-**28","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Yeah, yeah.","startTime":"12:59","endTime":"13:00","speaker_name":"Trent Christopher","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"That's kind of.","startTime":"13:00","endTime":"13:01","speaker_name":"Trent Christopher","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"That's what we're realizing is that the information is scattered and fragmented, duplicated.","startTime":"13:01","endTime":"13:08","speaker_name":"Trent Christopher","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Yeah, well, so that's why I'm suggesting, for instance, you can start off right, with the shared mailbox, literally as the master edited, you know, having somebody look at the other source.","startTime":"13:09","endTime":"13:24","speaker_name":"+1 480-***-**28","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Right.","startTime":"13:25","endTime":"13:25","speaker_name":"+1 480-***-**28","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Determine the accurately and then say, okay, boom, this is the most accurate of any information we have.","startTime":"13:25","endTime":"13:32","speaker_name":"+1 480-***-**28","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And now we'll use that.","startTime":"13:33","endTime":"13:34","speaker_name":"+1 480-***-**28","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Now we'll delete all these other.","startTime":"13:34","endTime":"13:36","speaker_name":"+1 480-***-**28","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So to speak, and this is the way forward the problem in any time I've dealt with Kelsey, and again, I'd say this in front of you, very hard to keep him disciplined in the fact that he's probably the guy that corrupts it.","startTime":"13:37","endTime":"13:53","speaker_name":"+1 480-***-**28","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And yet, you know, because, you know, he's in the moment of, well, I gotta do this right now.","startTime":"13:53","endTime":"13:58","speaker_name":"+1 480-***-**28","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Yeah, yeah, that's kind of.","startTime":"13:59","endTime":"14:01","speaker_name":"Trent Christopher","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"That's exactly what I was thinking too.","startTime":"14:01","endTime":"14:03","speaker_name":"Trent Christopher","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Yeah.","startTime":"14:03","endTime":"14:03","speaker_name":"Trent Christopher","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So.","startTime":"14:03","endTime":"14:04","speaker_name":"Trent Christopher","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So I'm just throwing out the same suggestions after about 100 years ago, which is, you know, get somebody to audit this, you know, put some time and effort to it, but realize that if the process goes along, somebody should be emailing or notifying the Master keeper of the data.","startTime":"14:14","endTime":"14:35","speaker_name":"+1 480-***-**28","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So it's not just clock.","startTime":"14:35","endTime":"14:37","speaker_name":"+1 480-***-**28","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Yeah, yeah, yeah.","startTime":"14:39","endTime":"14:41","speaker_name":"Trent Christopher","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So that's something that I'm trying to work out.","startTime":"14:41","endTime":"14:42","speaker_name":"Trent Christopher","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Is
