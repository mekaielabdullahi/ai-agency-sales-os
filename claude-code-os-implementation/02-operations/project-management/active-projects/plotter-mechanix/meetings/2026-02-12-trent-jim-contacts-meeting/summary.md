# Meeting Summary: Trent-Jim Contact Database Discussion

**Date:** February 12, 2026
**Participants:** Trent Christopher, Jim (Microsoft Exchange Expert/Advisor)
**Topic:** Contact Database Consolidation Strategy

## Executive Summary
The meeting focused on establishing a single, reliable contact repository to unify Plotter Mechanix's fragmented data across multiple platforms. Jim recommended using a Microsoft Shared Mailbox as the master repository, which offers a cost-effective solution with built-in contact, calendar, and email features.

## Key Solution: Shared Mailbox as Central Repository

### Benefits (07:08)
- Unified space for contacts, calendar, and email
- No additional cost from Microsoft
- Can act purely as contact store without email sending
- Accessible by all users with permissions
- Aligns with Microsoft's transition from public folders

### Technical Capabilities (08:34)
- Compatible with Power Automate and APIs
- Can sync with Outlook and third-party apps
- Supports programmatic access and manipulation
- Enables automatic replication to phones and devices
- No major restrictions found (14:52)

## Critical Challenges Identified

### 1. Data Duplication and Accuracy (12:54)
- Past third-party sync tools led to confusion and duplication
- Need for clean, audited master contact list
- Regular audits required with designated data manager
- Kelsey's lack of discipline risks data corruption

### 2. Mixed Personal/Business Contacts (16:24)
- Kelsey's 10,000+ contacts include personal and business mixed
- Creates clutter and reduces marketing effectiveness
- Need strict segmentation for targeted communications
- Current habits blur boundaries (using personal phone for business)

### 3. User Behavior Issues (11:07)

**Kelsey's Passion vs. Discipline:**
- Passionate but inconsistent in following data rules
- Makes frequent uncontrolled changes
- Eagerness overrides process adherence
- Systems must compensate for this behavior

## Recommended Implementation Approach

### 1. Master Data Steward Role (14:14)
- Dedicated person to audit and control changes
- Regular validation and duplicate removal
- Notification system for changes
- Essential for maintaining single source of truth

### 2. Segmentation Strategy (18:18)
- Force separation of business and personal contacts
- Make business-only contacts mandatory for work tasks
- Consider separate devices or accounts (15:36)
- Use iPad for contacts, phone only for calls (14:52)

### 3. Integration Plan
- Start with clean, audited shared mailbox
- Set up Power Automate workflows for syncing
- Connect to QuickBooks, Jobber, and other platforms
- Implement Quo phone service integration

## Historical Context

### Past Attempts (12:10)
- Previous sync setups failed due to poor data quality
- Third-party tools created more confusion
- Lack of process discipline undermined technical solutions
- Clean data is prerequisite for any sync solution

### Jim's Relationship (17:07)
- Long history supporting Kelsey with tools and resources
- Provided accounts and support without charge
- Deep understanding of Kelsey's habits and challenges
- Trusted advisor role influences solution design

### Kelsey's Concerns (17:50)
- Past negative experiences being taken advantage of
- Needs transparent, simple, trust-based solutions
- Solutions must not be overwhelming
- Requires gradual implementation with support

## Action Items

### Trent Christopher
1. **Implement shared mailbox** as master contact repository (10:02)
2. **Design Power Automate workflows** for synchronization across devices (08:34)
3. **Develop audit process** with designated 'master keeper' role (13:59)
4. **Create separation solution** for personal vs. business contacts (15:36)

### Jim
1. **Provide Exchange guidance** on shared mailbox best practices (05:12)
2. **Share historical context** from previous attempts (12:10)
3. **Advise on discipline requirements** for data management (16:24)

## Key Insights for Implementation

### Success Requirements
- Clean master data before any syncing
- Regular audits and quality control
- Process discipline enforcement
- User education and support
- Gradual rollout with feedback loops

### Risk Mitigation
- Design systems that compensate for user behavior
- Implement notifications and change tracking
- Force segmentation through technical barriers
- Provide clear boundaries and simple processes

## Next Steps

1. Set up shared mailbox infrastructure
2. Audit and clean existing contact data
3. Assign master data steward
4. Design Power Automate sync workflows
5. Implement segmentation rules
6. Train Kelsey on new processes
7. Monitor and adjust based on usage

## Impact on Phase 2 Solutions
This contact consolidation strategy directly supports:
- **Solution #1:** Contact Database Consolidation
- **Solution #4:** Andrew Supplies Integration (needs clean customer data)
- **Solution #3:** Operational Automation (unified communications)
