0:02 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
I'm just trying to find the Google Meet. Oh, really? So, the offers. Yeah, go ahead.

0:16 - Chris Andrade
I think it's such a, like, yeah, this is like what I, yeah. Ultimately, this is going to be our ticket in the door. And I think it's going to be, like, I, so that's, I messaged Trent early this morning about identifying the, like, creating an agent to identify those opportunities, right? And what, like, what can we give them just really fast, really quick, really cheap, right?

0:50 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Mm-hmm.

0:52 - Chris Andrade
So then, while in the middle of our interview, I I'm going to leave, I'm going to leave his message right I spent a lot of time on that message. But ultimately, was just saying that a prompt that could help. You know how we have our fireflies and it has that meeting? It's like that meeting view or it sits on the side of the Yeah.

1:30 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Like the bot.

1:32 - Chris Andrade
Right. Like make arises own version of that. Like a meeting right here. Let me actually copy this prompt because let me see if Trent getting I'm curious to see now because I for totally because this is the last. This is pretty much the last thing. Damn. He didn't. He never responded. So this is what I text Trent. I think he might have just forgot about it because dude's like a mad scientist man.

2:10 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Yeah.

2:10 - Chris Andrade
So this is what I text Trent. Because we had a conversation this morning after we were on that morning huddle with Liam.

2:21 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Oh, you guys were on a morning huddle today with Liam? Yeah, were there on his call, his Q&A.

2:30 - Chris Andrade
Grant asked a gangster question too.

2:33 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
What is that? do you ask?

2:37 - Chris Andrade
Ultimately, what we're talking about right now.

2:40 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Mini agents.

2:42 - Chris Andrade
And then he went off and then Liam's gonna post a whole, he said in a week, we'll be having a whole new like video about it coming out, which would be dope. Well, it's still cool.

2:55 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Yeah.

2:56 - Chris Andrade
Yeah. Good. All right. All right. All Now, what, because the reason why that even came up and why me and Trent were talking, so you see that prompt that I sent you? Not a prompt, it was like, because Liam asked, you know, if they build their own custom agent, right? He wants to make sure that he can sell it, or at least, like, identify why they need to build it, because ultimately, he's like, I hate wasting time just building , and, like, two weeks in or something, and you're like, why did I build this, you know?

3:43 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Yeah, like, why didn't I get paid at least 500 bucks or 1,000 bucks or something?

3:48 - Chris Andrade
Yeah, like, and so the reason why I say something like this would be really cool is for the fact that I needs something similar in the sense of knowledge base, so you see how I question, like, use the knowledge base and question the, it's been a while since I looked at this. But, I kind of forgot where I was like...

4:34 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
I don't know, like, for the prompt, it's kind of a lot to read right now, but I get... It's not necessarily a prompt.

4:41 - Chris Andrade
It's not necessarily a prompt. It's more or less why this tool would be beneficial. And it breaks it down to...

4:52 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
So is the tool that you're talking about, is that identifying the quick win, basically? Well... It's

5:00 - Chris Andrade
You know, for us, it's our version of that. My idea behind it is to create one that we can give to people to make their own knowledge base, like, because at the end of the day, that call upon agent, you know, that we can, it's all based off of our source of truth, right? And if we plug in, like, if you go down, do you see the bottom? Do you see the example that I set? Because I use Kelsey as plotter mechanics as an example.

5:39 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
So is it, how can it help sales? Oh, plotter example. One tool, target ID, printer type, locating service manual, ID error code, create checklist to follow, locate source and repair. Yep, build a virtual Kelsey. Okay, yeah. So it.

6:00 - Chris Andrade
But using the same deal for us, but just identifying different, different instances, right? Like different opportunities for us to be get to build a quick Trojan horse and be really quick and easy in and out of there, you know?

6:19 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Yeah, I mean, I'm thinking like on the website could be a good place for that, like, where they can just upload their information. Through a process discussion, we could just literally like show people Claude projects and have them put their own stuff in there. And then that's a knowledge base. Like, that's sort of like you can upload a bunch of files into there and then chat with it.

6:58 - Chris Andrade
But I think like we want to...

7:00 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Talk with them. then we want to understand what are their pain points. And then once we have that, then we can be like, okay, like why I'm to figure out a way we can do it on our, on, on one call.

7:17 - Chris Andrade
Ultimately is my ultimate solution is what I'm trying to figure out.

7:21 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
So we, we can do that by, so like, basically you're saying we need, we identify a quick win solution that we can offer them and be like, Hey, it'd be like 500 or thousand bucks.

7:34 - Chris Andrade
And then we already have these prebuilt demos, you know what I'm saying? Like that's catered to that. Like the, like, that's why the agent is guiding us to a prebuilt.

7:48 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
We can do that. We can have like two, uh, note recorders. And then one of them, we just literally in the beginning of the call, we just get all their pain points and we understand their technical art. We just asked, softwares are you guys using? What are your pain points? And then I can literally take my Fathom recorder, hit stop, jump off the call, or stay on the call, even, actually. I get what you're saying.

8:17 - Chris Andrade
I'm trying to make, because this is where, all right, so you see the other part in my thing is that when we create these little things, right? Because Liam said that, dude, you create these little bots, and then you charge a monthly fee that you add on to your clients for accessing this bot. So for this bot that you use for your knowledge base, we can charge Kelsey a fee per month, is what Liam was trying to say. He thinks this is where it's going to be going. Because these agents are going to be so customizable.

8:56 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Yeah, they're always going to want like little changes. Strangely.

9:00 - Chris Andrade
If you can build agents that are like a generalist, and ultimately you can customize an agent that makes our brand, the Arise, and we can sell that to our clients, and maybe that's just our own dashboard, exactly what we've been talking about. I think that's when I saw Trent saying, like, we've already kind of been, like, already talking about it, you know what mean? Because at the end of the day, that's... Can you flesh out a little more?

9:41 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
I'm not sure, like, what's the part where it's the focus on the Arise?

9:49 - Chris Andrade
Is, like, our own, are you talking about, like, the idea of, like, having our own customizable?

10:00 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Yeah, like dashboard or agent? Is it our own agent?

10:03 - Chris Andrade
So like, for instance, who's to say that we can't make the dashboard that PlotterMechanics accessing our dashboard and Kelsey has access to it? And we customize our standardized dashboard for Kelsey. Does that make sense? So then we can plug in our own widgets if Kelsey needs that specialized widget. For instance, like the overlapping opportunities.

10:48 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
It's like a dashboard that comes with, okay, there's lead generation, there's automations, there's... Yeah, like the business solution...

10:59 - Chris Andrade
Yeah. You can standardize them. That's what Liam was saying. They're all going to be somewhat... So it is the first one. Damn it. Sorry. No, you're good.

11:20 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
I'm doing something else over here, too. I have our dashboard for observing our agency operations, but there should be a more general one that's just lead acquisition, operations, and then I forgot the other one. There's, like, three pieces of the businesses. Lead generation, operations. I can't look at the other one. Probably marketing is kind of under lead generation, though. you.

11:58 - Chris Andrade
Thank I am in a critical moment here real quick. One second. I want to make that with you, my friend. I'm just in the phone. No. Gosh, my son is here again. I love it when he comes and works with me. It's the coolest. I had my son changing tires when he was like, almost like three years old.

12:39 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Wow.

12:41 - Chris Andrade
And my daughters.

12:42 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Nice. This is the routine.

12:45 - Chris Andrade
If we ever break down on the side of the road, you're responsible for this? The jack? Someone puts out the hazard? Yeah. I'm sorry. I got distracted.

12:58 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Okay. but… that. Yeah, perfect. Awesome.

13:06 - Chris Andrade
You were talking about.

13:11 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Just like we can have like a bare bones sort of dashboard that's just acquisition engine on like delivery, like service or product delivery, and then client customer support. And then we just have like automations.

13:30 - Chris Andrade
So let's focus on plotter mechanics real quick, because I honestly don't think we should release anything to plotter mechanics without us officializing our own dashboard and using it from iteration one. I don't see why we would want to give Kelsey his own version. You know what mean? Like we should lock that in and market that like, this is our version and look what our version is doing for. think… For… Yep. His business, you know what saying?

14:03 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Yeah, it also makes more sense for them because they don't have like a tech person to manage that. Exactly.

14:09 - Chris Andrade
Regardless, we're going to have to put support at the end of the day.

14:14 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Yeah. know what I mean?

14:16 - Chris Andrade
The end of the day, we're going to have to do it. Yeah.

14:23 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
And maybe it's like you get like a, I don't know. I don't know how to define that support because I guess like. Well, we're supporting it every day, bro.

14:37 - Chris Andrade
Like we're already supporting it. then after we get to the close, like once we can't do or build anymore, right? Then that looks like that's a whole other handshake. You know what I mean? Because now we're at the end of life of our like services. life of services, and then we come. At this point, we're at more like, we're done implementing, right? Now we're into monitoring, tracking, progressing, you know?

15:22 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Yeah. And then that might just be a gap. And then they need to, like, hire and scale and build. And when they get to the next stage, then we're there for whenever they need more automations. Mm-hmm. But yeah, for now, like, yeah, I agree that the dashboard, like, we should manage that and work out a retainer basis.

15:46 - Chris Andrade
What do you mean by retainer basis?

15:48 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Well, like, for managing the dashboard or for, like, being the ones who, who, like, make sure that it keeps working. And, like, they don't... ...

16:00 - Chris Andrade
have a tech person to run that right right okay so so you're okay i see what you're reckoning saying no that's where i'm and that's exactly what i'm getting at too is we can't we we there is no reason why we shouldn't um be going after that because that's just um it's not only i i again yeah i don't it's not the monetary value right yeah it's just like that's comfortable it's it's just gonna be like maintenance concept you know what you mean and and that's where i think is um the most crucial component here you know oh so i was supposed to put it on there At the end of the day, you know, what it kind of comes down to, so I'm just curious, like, I, so, for instance, like, how, for plotter mechanics, go back to that, like, how do you see that looking for plotter mechanics? Like, let's say if we hit, because did you and Mikael kind of hone into what you think the deliverables are going to look like for him?
ACTION ITEM: Review Kelsey's website service intake; propose redirect or integrate into portal - WATCH: https://fathom.video/share/5UdFZ-DzFU_Ay_4yF8yAszEiy1k1ehAY?timestamp=1069.9999

17:48 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
We made progress, I think. Yeah, I think we have a decent idea. Basically, like, it's the... The base, the training center, the customer portal, we're thinking like, I mean, I just saw something today that was like, they already created like a service request intake on their website, but it would require like them redirecting people there. So I need to kind of go back and look at that. But I think, I think like the main thing is just where, wherever Alyssa is spending time, we need to create automation to update that workflow, so that she can be more optimized. And also, we need to, what we were, what I started working on today was like a demo, like an agent that can just hook into Quo and hook into Jobber, so that like, they can just look up information by chatting with the agent. Um, and that should speed things up for them. But then I tell you, keep going. So the other thing is just the, uh, the token training manuals. So, or like the printer manuals, I think. So I talked to Trent a little bit, or he sent me a voice message that was like, that part is probably going to be a bit more complicated because those manuals are probably like dense, uh, with information. So retrieving the right information is going to be a bit more engineering work than just what I thought.

19:40 - Chris Andrade
So, so how I honestly, how do we tie that in to the project then? Like, how are we, cause like, or Okay. Okay. Okay, before we go into that, what's the other, what's the other, I guess, deliverable or thing that we're going to hone in on the offer that we're honing in on?

20:14 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Are you talking about for plotter mechanics? Yeah. So let me pull up the demo site. I think like this, the technician training is something that they're going to need to scale. The agent is something they're going to need to like, just be more efficient hooking into their emails and quo and jobber. And then I don't know how supply like I have a supplies tab on here. I know that I don't I just feel like we need to talk with Andrew about how he does stuff because I don't want to suggest this if they don't actually need a supplies dashboard. Um, and then the other thing is the customer portal. So like what I'm thinking is like our offer is going to be, okay, here's all the things that we've identified that would help and here are their prices. Now we can do like, we can, if you're, if you're willing to pay us, like the full price of all of these, like we will price it out based on the ROI. So it'll be a fair price, um, but it's like, whatever your budget is, we can work with you on that and we can, we can deliver things like, or we can do, I think that's how we offer, offer it to like this, let's say, like, um, give them a demo, right?

21:48 - Chris Andrade
And then before we offer any pricing, let's sit, let's. Ask for their budget. And then from there, we can say, this is what we can do, or this is what we were thinking. And like, is that, doesn't that seem like a good plan of attack? Yeah, exactly.

22:18 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Because they've already said, okay, we have this much we could do. Even if they lowball, it's like, okay, if you say you only have 10,000, then you can, like, we would recommend this installment payments, or like, or, or, or, or like, whatever their budget is, right?

22:36 - Chris Andrade
And let's say their budget is, let's just say 2000. Right? Like, okay, we can get you up to this fees with that type of investment.

22:48 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Yep.

22:50 - Chris Andrade
You know, you know what mean? Yeah, exactly.

22:53 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
And it's like, okay, well, they've seen all this stuff that we could do. But if they only have $2,000. It's like, can only do this. Sorry. Right. Yeah.

23:03 - Chris Andrade
And then, and then just, that's how it'll just take longer. Yeah. But then they're going to, they're going to want to get it. Like they're going to like in that $2,000 really in all reality is only going to take us like, um, I mean, won't take a certain amount of time. Yeah. It's not going to tell you, it's not like it's going to take us weeks to do. Like we should be able to do it honestly within a week or something. If that's the case, you know what I'm Yeah.

23:40 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Yeah.

23:43 - Chris Andrade
Depending on whatever it is. Right. But at the end of the day, it's still doable and, and, and we can. And okay, you know, here it is. Let us, like, we'll come back in a week, and then say, okay, what's this next budget, you know, and just keep asking them what their budget is, and let them keep telling us, like, how much they're wanting to do until we can set some matrix of our own, you know.

24:17 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Yeah, so I had a similar idea to that. then Trent ran it through, I created a notion page with kind of like that idea of like, just week by week. And, and like, maybe start out small, and then we ramp it up over time once they see the value. And then he got this acquisition AI feedback that was like, don't sell week one, sell the four week outcome. So we can do pricing, like we can just pay over time, like, you pay weekly, you can stop anytime. Most clients invest 7, 7.5k to 10k over the month. Right. Like we collect in weekly chunks, but we saw one outcome and one plan for the for the whole four weeks. So it's like, that's what we're getting at. We you can pay weekly, you know, if you want to do that, and then we just deliver weekly. Yeah, yeah.

25:17 - Chris Andrade
And that will at least get some coffers going, you know.

25:22 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Yeah, that's at the end of the day, we just need our foot in the door because once we get our foot in the door, then people are gonna be like, this is amazing. We need more of this. Yeah, exactly.

25:34 - Chris Andrade
At the end of the day, that's what's gonna happen. We know it, we just gotta wait for it, or not wait for it. We just got to build it. But it costs money to do, you know?

25:45 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Yeah. And then, yeah, and like, if we just limit the scope, then we can just build a little bit at a time. And then we can do that across multiple clients, like we can go, we can try and ramp up the volume on the number of clients. that's a . . . . . up. And then, yeah, mean, ultimately, that first deliverable, I think, I think we're on the same page.

26:12 - Chris Andrade
Yeah, I think we're on the same page. Cool. I think we're all on, I think we're all on the same page. And I think that's going to be the best, quickest way to get some money in the bank. At the end of the day.

26:28 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
No, that's the goal. Yeah.

26:30 - Chris Andrade
I for sure agree that that's going to be how we do it.

26:34 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
I'm kind of wondering with plotter mechanics, if we, yeah, because we don't want to just get the no for like 10,000. Oh, yeah. But we do have, so. Okay, so.

26:46 - Chris Andrade
We, we need to, have we done any matrix on, like, QO analyzation on Andrew? Like, had it. well then done Do we have any reports on Andrew and interactions with Alyssa or, in general, with Kelsey? Like, any reports going on over there? Because he's part of that Tucson, remember that Tucson story? He's a big part of that Tucson story.
ACTION ITEM: Analyze Quo Andrew↔Alyssa calls; prep insights for Kelsey offer call - WATCH: https://fathom.video/share/5UdFZ-DzFU_Ay_4yF8yAszEiy1k1ehAY?timestamp=1638.9999

27:18 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Okay. Yeah, I mean, all we have is what you've told me in the Fathom recordings, so I don't have anything processed from Quo.

27:29 - Chris Andrade
Do you think we can, like, can you pull that up right now? Just curious. See if you can find that Tuesday? Or, I'm sorry, Wednesday, I think, what did say? Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday? Is what we're going to reference? Okay. Or, unless you're doing something. Unless you're doing something. My fault. I shouldn't have said that, but I didn't know if you were doing something.

27:53 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Uh, no, I mean, I can, I can pull it up, I think. No, I just, because what I, the reason why I'm saying.

28:00 - Chris Andrade
And this is because if we can show some, if we can also try to impress Andrew at the same time, like, yeah, we, we did some analysis on Andrew and because we're trying to figure out how Alyssa's workflow is. And obviously Alyssa and Andrew need to be more efficient at the end of the day, because they're a big component to the whole money stream.

28:37 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Right?

28:38 - Chris Andrade
So if, if we use, because if, I feel like we would be, we wouldn't be doing our due diligence if we didn't include Andrew in any of the workflow at the end of the day, right? Cause he's a big component to, um, Kelsey, you know what I mean? Yeah, think Quo is probably how we can like, we can understand the supplies and that's our only, only option is if we use Quo in that way. Because I don't have, I only had talked to them that once, right. And I only hear what Kelsey tells me and you know how that is. I'd rather try to hear, I'd rather see how their direct interactions and all that is going. And then have a workflow that incorporates Alyssa just on that aspect alone.

29:41 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
So Andrew has been making calls in Quo or receiving calls since January 14th. So we were about to do.

29:50 - Chris Andrade
Dude. As far as I can tell.

29:53 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Okay.

29:53 - Chris Andrade
Is it sure how many calls do you think? Let me make sure this one is.

29:58 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
... ... For Andrew, I can't tell, like, it's under Andrew's number, so that should be, let me see, I think that is, yeah, I think that is how it works. Yeah, because I think, so I think if I, I can, the agent that I was working on this morning was to hook into Quo and Jobber, so if I can just chat with that agent and ask it about, like, I can ask it stuff about Andrew's calls.

30:50 - Chris Andrade
Yeah, just like, hey, what does Andrew talk about mainly? And then like, oh, how does Andrew reach or talk to Alyssa? Or how many? Many times Andrew talked to Alyssa or maybe we just focus on that for now, just using Alyssa. We ultimately know what he's doing, but let's just focus on how he interacts with Alyssa, because at the end of the day, that's our golden nugget, you know what I mean? Mm-hmm. Where is I going? What was I doing? Where is I going? Oh, yeah.

31:45 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
All right. I need to get together a plan of everything that we're going to do, because I would like to do this as soon as possible during the week, like the proposal. I would like to knock it out by Monday, bro.

31:59 - Chris Andrade
Oh. Tuesday, because I'll have a good, maybe by Wednesday, because I'll have all day with Kelsey on Monday. I'll have his brain picked clean. I'm going to get all the manuals, right? We'll have a good idea of what the manuals look like. We'll have some research done on QL with Andrew and Alyssa, right?

32:29 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
tomorrow, your time, is the offer call. Yeah. Yep.

32:34 - Chris Andrade
I will have family here, but I'll just, it's fine. I'll just have to, I told her I'm going lock myself in the office for the call.

32:51 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Okay. Okay. So I'll try and I'll see how much of this I can get like info I can get before tomorrow. Tomorrow. Tomorrow. Tomorrow.

33:02 - Chris Andrade
Okay. Sounds good, man. I'm gonna keep frickin' scrubbing metal and cleaning bricks.

33:11 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Sorry, man.

33:12 - Chris Andrade
Like, I feel guilty that you're having to do this all by yourself, but I have to get this done to get to Kelsey, so I don't, like, you know what I mean? Because my 's, like, bad.

33:22 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Yeah, I know. You gotta do that. So, it's all good. I gotta finish up this other thing, and then I'll get right into the quo and the agent.
