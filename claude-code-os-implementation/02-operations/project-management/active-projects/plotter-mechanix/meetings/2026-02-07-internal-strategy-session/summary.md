## Executive Summary

This meeting defined the core go-to-market strategy for PlotterMechanics and established the **Arise Dashboard** as the agency's strategic product. Key decisions:

1. **Foot-in-the-Door Strategy:** Lead with small, quick-win projects ($500-1k) to demonstrate value
2. **Arise Dashboard as Core Product:** Position as the central client hub managed on retainer
3. **PlotterMechanics as First Case Study:** Use this engagement to validate the dashboard approach
4. **Proposal Due Tuesday:** Contingent on final data gathering from Monday's meeting with Kelsey

---

## Strategic Decisions

### 1. Sales Strategy: "Foot-in-the-Door" Approach

**Problem:** Need to secure initial client revenue to fund operations and build trust for larger engagements.

**Solution:** Offer small, low-cost "Trojan horse" projects to demonstrate value quickly.

**Implementation:**
- Lead with $500-$1k knowledge base agents or similar quick wins
- Ask for client's budget upfront, then scope project to fit
- Use success of initial project to naturally expand into larger engagements

**Rationale:** Builds trust incrementally and creates a natural path to bigger projects as clients see results.

### 2. Product Strategy: The Arise Dashboard 🌟

**Core Concept:** A standardized Arise dashboard serving as the central hub for all client solutions.

**Why This is a "Golden Nugget":**

1. **Client Stickiness:** Clients access all their tools through our platform, increasing reliance on us
2. **Recurring Revenue:** We manage the dashboard on retainer, providing stable income stream
3. **Case Study Generation:** PlotterMechanics becomes our first validated success story

**Standard Modules:**
- Lead generation tools
- Operations management
- Customer support systems
- Client-specific integrations

**Management Model:** Retainer-based dashboard management (clients like PlotterMechanics lack tech staff to manage it themselves)
