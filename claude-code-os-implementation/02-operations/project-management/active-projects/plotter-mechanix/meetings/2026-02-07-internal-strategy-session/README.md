## Meeting Context

This impromptu session was called to finalize the sales strategy and proposal approach for PlotterMechanics ahead of:
- **Monday:** Chris's final requirements gathering with Kelsey
- **Sunday 2:30 PM:** Offer call with Kelsey
- **Tuesday:** Proposal delivery deadline

---

## Strategic Significance

This meeting represents a **pivot point** for the agency's go-to-market approach:

### Before This Meeting
- Individual solution sales
- Custom builds per client
- One-time project revenue

### After This Meeting
- **Product-led approach:** Arise Dashboard as core offering
- **Standardized modules:** Reduce custom work per client
- **Recurring revenue:** Dashboard management retainers
- **Foot-in-the-door strategy:** Quick wins lead to larger engagements

---

## Key Decisions Made

1. **Arise Dashboard** becomes the agency's strategic product (not just a PlotterMechanics feature)
2. **PlotterMechanics** will be the first case study validating this approach
3. **Foot-in-the-door pricing** strategy formalized ($500-1k entry point)
4. **4-week engagement model** with weekly payments ($7.5k-$10k total)
