## 🔑 Critical Discoveries (Alyssa Part 2 - Feb 6, 2026)

1. **Communication Workflow Crisis**
   - Alyssa: 20-25 hrs/week (50% of time) processing communications
   - 10 separate email inboxes with broken notifications
   - Not just "email" - it's quotes, orders, job updates, parts research

2. **No Inventory System Exists**
   - Everything manual - "I think we have it, let me check"
   - Can't link items to PO numbers for RMAs
   - Pile of unresolved RMAs from last year

3. **Duplicate Data Breaking Systems**
   - "We have seven Daves" in QuickBooks
   - Can't merge duplicate clients in Jobber
   - 30 min/day manual reconciliation

4. **Training Burden**
   - Each new tech costs Kelsey 120-200 hours
   - February: 2 new hires = 400 hours = $70,000 opportunity cost
