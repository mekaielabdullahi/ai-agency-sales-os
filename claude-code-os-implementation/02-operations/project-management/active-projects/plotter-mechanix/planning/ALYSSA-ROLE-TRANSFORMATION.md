# Potter Mechanix Role Transformation Framework

**Meeting Date:** December 17, 2025
**Purpose:** Frame AI automation as a PROMOTION for everyone, not a replacement

---

## DOCUMENT OVERVIEW

1. **Alyssa's Transformation** - Data Capturer → System Overseer
2. **Service Call Qualification System** - Known vs Unknown problems
3. **Kelsey's Transformation** - Does everything → Handles hard stuff + relationships
4. **How It All Connects** - The complete operational model

---

## THE KEY MESSAGE

**This is a promotion for both Kelsey AND Alyssa.**

The AI doesn't replace Alyssa - it handles the tedious, memory-intensive work so she can do higher-value work that requires human creativity, judgment, and relationships.

---

## CURRENT STATE: Alyssa as "Data Capturer"

**What she does today:**
```
Kelsey calls → Alyssa writes notes on paper
                      ↓
              Transcribes to Jobber
                      ↓
              Creates invoices
                      ↓
              Manages scheduling
                      ↓
              Answers status calls
```

**The pain (from discovery calls):**
- 15-20 minute calls to capture every detail
- "Memory is not good" - human limitation, not her fault
- Both Kelsey and Alyssa tied up in data transfer
- Information sometimes gets lost
- Constant back-and-forth for clarification
- No time for higher-level work

---

## FUTURE STATE: Alyssa as "System Overseer"

**What AI handles:**
```
Kelsey leaves voice note → AI captures 100% automatically
                               ↓
                         Goes directly to Jobber
                               ↓
                         Alyssa REVIEWS (not captures)
                               ↓
                         Quick clarification if needed
                               ↓
                         Done in 2-3 minutes vs 15-20
```

**What Alyssa does (NEW role):**
1. **AI Quality Control** - Review what the AI captured, catch mistakes
2. **Process Refinement** - Improve SOPs and train the system
3. **Exception Handling** - Handle the edge cases AI can't figure out
4. **Higher-Value Work** - Inventory, training, customer relationships

---

## THE PROMOTION FRAMEWORK

### Level 1: DATA CAPTURER (Current)
- Writes down everything Kelsey says
- Transcribes to systems manually
- Memory-dependent
- Bottlenecked by call time

### Level 2: SYSTEM OVERSEER (After AI)
- Reviews AI-captured data
- Flags errors and edge cases
- Trains the AI to be better
- 80% less time on data entry

### Level 3: OPERATIONS LEAD (Growth Path)
- Refines SOPs for the business
- Manages inventory system
- Trains new employees
- Strategic customer relationships

---

## SPECIFIC NEW RESPONSIBILITIES

### 1. AI Quality Assurance
**What it looks like:**
- Kelsey leaves voice note while driving
- AI transcribes and puts in Jobber
- Alyssa sees: "New service call note - READY FOR REVIEW"
- She checks: Is this right? Anything missing?
- Quick 30-second review vs 15-minute call

**Her value:** She knows the business better than the AI. She catches what it misses.

### 2. Process Improvement
**What it looks like:**
- She notices AI keeps getting confused about certain terms
- She documents: "When Kelsey says X, he means Y"
- AI gets better over time
- She's the EXPERT on how the system should work

**Her value:** Human creativity to improve systems. AI can't do this.

### 3. Inventory Management (Her Magic Wand)
From discovery call - Alyssa said:
> "If we could get inventory wrapped, that would be fantastic. Then when he calls asking 'do we have this?' I can just look instead of running back and forth."

**Now she has TIME to:**
- Actually manage inventory
- Know what's in stock
- Stop running back and forth
- Enable eBay surplus sales

### 4. Employee Training & Onboarding
**What it looks like:**
- Document how things work
- Train Joe (and future hires)
- Create onboarding materials
- Be the keeper of "how we do things"

**Her value:** Institutional knowledge + documentation skills

### 5. Customer Relationship Management
**What it looks like:**
- Proactive customer follow-ups
- Relationship building (not just status updates)
- Upselling opportunities
- Customer satisfaction calls

**Her value:** Human connection that AI can't replicate

---

## THE CONVERSATION COMPARISON

### BEFORE (15-20 minute call)
```
Kelsey: "Hey, I just finished at ABC Company..."
Alyssa: "Okay, let me get my notepad..."
Kelsey: "So the print head was clogged, 24-inch..."
Alyssa: "Wait, which print head model?"
Kelsey: "The HP 792, and I also..."
[15-20 minutes of back-and-forth]
[End of call - review everything]
Kelsey: "Did you get all that?"
Alyssa: "I think so, let me read it back..."
[Both stressed, time wasted]
```

### AFTER (2-3 minute check-in)
```
[Kelsey leaves 2-minute voice note while driving]
[AI transcribes everything to Jobber automatically]
[Alyssa sees the note, reviews quickly]

Alyssa: "Hey Kelsey, quick question - the AI captured
the HP 792 print head replacement. Was that the
cyan or the black?"
Kelsey: "Black."
Alyssa: "Got it, all set!"
[2 minutes, both happy]
```

**Both freed up to think about bigger things.**

---

## ANSWERING THE FEAR: "What will I do?"

**There's UNLIMITED work in the universe. Here's what opens up:**

| Time Freed | New Activity | Business Impact |
|------------|--------------|-----------------|
| 10 hrs/week on note-taking | Inventory management | Know what's in stock |
| 5 hrs/week on status calls | Customer follow-ups | Better retention |
| 3 hrs/week on transcription | SOP documentation | Enable scaling |
| 2 hrs/week on clarification | Employee training | Joe gets better faster |

**Total: 20 hrs/week freed up for GROWTH activities**

---

## KEY TALKING POINTS FOR THE MEETING

1. **"This is a promotion, not a replacement"**
   - You're going from data entry to system management
   - That's a higher-level skill

2. **"The AI will have your back"**
   - You won't get blamed for forgetting something
   - The AI captures everything, you verify
   - Better memory than any human

3. **"You become the expert"**
   - You know better than the AI what's right
   - You train it to be better
   - You're the quality control

4. **"Quicker conversations = less stress"**
   - 2 minutes of clarification vs 20 minutes of dictation
   - Both you AND Kelsey freed up
   - Less pressure to remember everything

5. **"There's plenty to do"**
   - Inventory management
   - Training Joe
   - Customer relationships
   - Process improvement
   - Whatever Kelsey needs help with

6. **"You're still essential"**
   - AI can't replace human judgment
   - AI can't build relationships
   - AI can't handle weird edge cases
   - You're the human in the loop

---

## THE KELSEY BENEFIT (Flip Side)

**For Kelsey:**
- Leave voice notes while driving (async communication)
- Don't have to stop for 20-minute calls
- Information captured even when busy
- Focus on technical work, not admin communication

**Quote to use:**
> "This frees up BOTH of you. Kelsey can focus on fixing printers
> and growing the business. Alyssa can focus on making sure
> everything runs smoothly. Neither of you is stuck on
> data entry anymore."

---

## THE SERVICE CALL QUALIFICATION SYSTEM

**This is how Kelsey stops doing everything.**

### The Core Idea

```
Service Call Comes In
        ↓
   [Is This a KNOWN Problem?]
        ↓
    ↙ YES              NO ↘
   ↓                       ↓
[Check Knowledge Base]   [UNKNOWN]
   ↓                       ↓
"Printer 5000 - we       Kelsey handles
know how to do that"          ↓
   ↓                   He's the problem-solving king
[Who's trained on it?]   20 years of experience
   ↓                       ↓
Send qualified employee  Figures it out OR
   ↓                   finds someone who can
Joe handles it              ↓
                      Documents the solution
                            ↓
                      Becomes a KNOWN problem
                            ↓
                      Gets added to training
```

### Two Categories of Service Calls

| KNOWN Problems | UNKNOWN Problems |
|----------------|------------------|
| In the knowledge base | Not documented yet |
| Training module exists | Kelsey figures it out |
| Qualified employees can go | Kelsey goes (or handles remotely) |
| Scalable | Not scalable (yet) |

**The goal:** Turn UNKNOWN into KNOWN over time. That's how you scale.

### The Company Knowledge Base

**What it contains:**
- Printers they know how to service
- Step-by-step repair videos
- Troubleshooting guides
- Parts needed for each repair
- Time estimates ("print head = 1.75 hrs")

**How it works:**
1. Service call comes in: "HP DesignJet 5000 not printing"
2. Check knowledge base: "Do we know how to do this?"
3. If YES → Which employees are trained? → Send one
4. If NO → Kelsey handles → Documents solution → Now it's known

### Employee Qualification System

```
Employee sees training module: "HP 792 Print Head Replacement"
        ↓
Completes training (video + quiz)
        ↓
Gets CERTIFIED on that repair
        ↓
Service call comes in for HP 792
        ↓
System says: "Joe is certified - he can handle this"
        ↓
Joe goes, does the job
        ↓
Kelsey freed up for harder problems
```

**Employees level up over time:**
- Start: Handles basic known problems
- 3 months: Handles intermediate problems
- 6 months: Can tackle some unknown with guidance
- 1 year: Handles most things, Kelsey just for edge cases

---

## KELSEY'S ROLE TRANSFORMATION

**From:** Does everything (100% of technical work)
**To:** Handles unknowns + builds relationships + trains the system

### What Kelsey Does NOW (Current)
- Every service call
- Every unknown problem
- Every known problem
- Phone blowing up
- Driving all over town
- Training Joe manually
- Building relationships
- Admin communication

### What Kelsey Does AFTER (With System)

**Kelsey focuses on:**
1. **Unknown Problems** - The hard stuff only he can solve
2. **Relationships** - Still gives business card to neighboring business
3. **Training Content** - Records how he solves things
4. **Remote Consulting** - $175/call from the porch

**Others handle:**
1. **Known Problems** - Trained employees go
2. **Admin/Communication** - AI + Alyssa
3. **Basic Service Calls** - Joe + future hires

### The Kelsey Day: Before vs After

**BEFORE:**
```
5 AM → Load truck (no inventory system)
     → 1 hr commute
     → Service call #1 (known problem)
     → Service call #2 (known problem)
     → Service call #3 (unknown problem)
     → Service call #4 (known problem)
     → Service call #5 (known problem)
     → 1 hr commute home
     → Exhausted, phone still ringing
```

**AFTER:**
```
Morning → Joe handles 3 known problems
        → Kelsey handles 1 unknown problem
        → Kelsey does 2 remote consultations ($350)
        → Gives business cards at site
        → Records video of new repair
        → Home by 3pm, not exhausted
```

### Kelsey Still Does What He's Best At

- **Problem-solving** - 20 years of experience
- **Relationships** - Building connections at sites
- **Training** - Teaching Joe (but now via recorded content)
- **Strategy** - Growing the business

He just stops doing the stuff that anyone can do once trained.

```

**Everyone levels up:**
- **Alyssa:** Data capturer → System overseer
- **Kelsey:** Does everything → Handles hard stuff + relationships
- **Joe:** Can't do much → Handles all known problems
- **Business:** Kelsey-dependent → Scalable

## THE PITCH TO KELSEY

> "You said your magic wand was 'a reliable field tech I can send to 50% of jobs.'
>
> The training system IS that magic wand. You record how to do things once.
> Employees learn from the videos. They get certified. They handle the known stuff.
>
> You only go to the hard problems - the ones that need your 20 years of experience.
> You still do relationships, still give out business cards, still grow the business.
>
> But you stop doing the stuff that anyone could do if they were trained.
> That's how you scale. That's how you move to Piantop."

---

## THE TRANSITION PLAN

### Week 1-2: Learning the System
- AI starts capturing Kelsey's voice notes
- Alyssa reviews EVERYTHING (100% oversight)
- She notes where it's wrong
- We fix the issues

### Week 3-4: Building Confidence
- AI gets better based on her feedback
- She starts reviewing 80% (spot checks)
- Takes on inventory management
- Documents initial SOPs

### Month 2+: Full Overseer Mode
- Quick reviews, exception handling
- Full ownership of inventory
- Training materials for Joe
- Customer relationship initiatives

---

## OBJECTION HANDLING

**"But she won't have anything to do"**
→ "The opposite - she'll finally have time for the work that actually grows the business. Inventory, training, customer relationships."

**"What if she doesn't like the new role?"**
→ "Let's ask her. Most people prefer oversight to data entry. It's less stressful and more interesting."

**"We still need someone answering phones"**
→ "She still will. The AI handles transcription, not phone answering. She's the human connection."

**"What about job security?"**
→ "This makes her MORE valuable. She's now a system manager, not just a note-taker. That's harder to replace."

---

## SUMMARY FOR THE MEETING

```
Current:  Alyssa = Data Capturer (bottlenecked, stressed, memory-dependent)
                         ↓
With AI:  Alyssa = System Overseer (empowered, strategic, growth-focused)
                         ↓
Result:   PROMOTION for both Kelsey and Alyssa
          - Faster communication
          - Less stress
          - Better accuracy
          - Time for what matters
```

**The pitch:**
> "We're not replacing Alyssa. We're promoting her. She goes from
> capturing data to managing systems. That's a higher-level job.
> The AI handles the tedious memory work. She handles the judgment,
> creativity, and relationships that only humans can do."
