## Summary

Thank you, Kelsey, for trusting AriseGroup with your communications transformation. Over the past 7 weeks, we've worked closely with your team to build a unified phone system that captures every call, routes intelligently, and integrates directly with Jobber.

### Your New Phone System

| Before | After |
|--------|-------|
| Two separate phone numbers (Verizon cell + Vonage office) | Both numbers unified in Quo |
| Calls went to whoever picked up | Smart routing: Service → Kelsey, Supplies → Alyssa, etc. |
| No record of what was discussed | Every call transcribed and summarized by AI |
| Manual entry into Jobber | Calls automatically create Jobber requests |
| After-hours calls went to voicemail | AI assistant handles calls 24/7 |

### Phase 1 Deliverables

1. **Complete Phone Migration**
   - Ported your cell (602-722-8932) from Verizon
   - Ported office line (602-606-8845) from Vonage
   - Set up all 3 users: Kelsey, Alyssa, Andrew

2. **Smart Call Routing**
   - IVR menu (Press 1 for Service, 2 for Supplies, 3 for Printing, 4 for Equipment)
   - Business hours: 8 AM - 6 PM MST
   - After-hours AI assistant handles calls

3. **Quo-to-Jobber Automation**
   - Calls automatically create requests in Jobber
   - AI extracts customer info, service issues, part numbers
   - No more forgetting to log calls

4. **Compliance & Registration**
   - SMS privacy policy on website
   - Hiya/Free Caller Registry (reduces "Scam Likely")
   - A2P registration for texting

## Your Feedback

> *"This is so beneficial to me being able to make the phone call and then I have to make another phone call and try and explain what the Phone Call was about."*

> *"Either way, phone problems or not it's still way better than it was a month ago"*

> *"This is perfect right here."*

> *"No problem, thank you Trent. You're the man."*
