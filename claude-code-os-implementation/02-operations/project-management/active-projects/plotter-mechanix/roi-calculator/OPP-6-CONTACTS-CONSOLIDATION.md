# OPPORTUNITY 6: Contacts Consolidation + Outreach/Marketing

## Solution Overview
Consolidate fragmented contact databases across Capsule CRM, Jobber, QuickBooks, Outlook, and personal phones into a single unified system. Enables team-wide visibility, systematic follow-up, and marketing/outreach capabilities.

---

## Methodology Notes

**Pattern Used:** A + B + C

**Why this pattern:**
- Section A captures time costs (duplicate management, data cleanup, sync errors, searching)
- Section B captures revenue lost TODAY (contact invisibility, unused CRM waste)
- Section C captures NEW revenue enabled (AR recovery, supplies visibility, contracts, activation)

**What's NOT included (to avoid double-counting):**
- AR collection gaps were REMOVED from Section B (they appear in Section C as "AR systematic recovery")
- The same AR accounts cannot be counted as both a current loss AND future recovery

**Range Methodology for Section A:**
- Calculated values use formula: Time × $25/hr × 260 days
- LOW range assumes 80% of calculated (conservative efficiency gains)
- HIGH range assumes 120% of calculated (accounts for variability)

**Audit Note:** Per Morningside AI methodology, Section B should only include revenue walking out the door that cannot be recovered, while Section C should include new activities enabled by consolidated data.

## SECTION A: WHAT THIS PROBLEM COSTS IN WASTED TIME

### Formula: Time × People × 260 days × Hourly Rate

| Field | Value | Source | Rationale |
|-------|-------|--------|-----------|
| Duplicate entry elimination | **0.5 hrs/day** | Plotter Mechanix-alyssa workflow | "We have like seven Daves" |
| Data cleanup time | **0.25 hrs/day** | Plotter Mechanix-alyssa workflow | Fixing mismatched records |
| QuickBooks sync errors | **0.125 hrs/day** | Plotter Mechanix-alyssa workflow | "Breaking weekly" - manual fixes |
| Contact search time | **0.5 hrs/day** | Estimated | Finding info across 5 systems |
| Alyssa's hourly rate | **$25** | User input | Administrative rate |
| Working days per year | **260** | Standard | 52 weeks × 5 days |

### Fireflies Evidence (Section A):

**Duplicate Contact Problems:**
> "We have like seven Daves"
> — Alyssa (Plotter Mechanix-alyssa workflow)

**System Fragmentation:**
> Contact disparity: "Kelsey 10,581 vs Alyssa 43 vs Andrew 2"
> — Plotter Mechanix-alyssa workflow

**QuickBooks Sync Issues:**
> "Breaking weekly" - QuickBooks sync with Jobber constantly failing
> — Plotter Mechanix-alyssa workflow

### Calculation (Section A):

**Base Calculations:**
```
Duplicate elimination:    0.5 hrs × $25 × 260 = $3,250/year
Data cleanup:             0.25 hrs × $25 × 260 = $1,625/year
QuickBooks sync errors:   0.125 hrs × $25 × 260 = $812.50/year
Contact search time:      0.5 hrs × $25 × 260 = $3,250/year
CALCULATED TOTAL:         $8,937.50/year
```

**Range Application:**
- LOW (80% efficiency): $8,937.50 × 0.80 = $7,150
- HIGH (120% variability): $8,937.50 × 1.20 = $10,725

### Section A Summary:

| Cost Area | Calculated | Annual LOW (80%) | Annual HIGH (120%) |
|-----------|------------|------------------|-------------------|
| Duplicate entry elimination | $3,250 | $2,600 | $3,900 |
| Data cleanup | $1,625 | $1,300 | $1,950 |
| QuickBooks sync errors | $812.50 | $650 | $975 |
| Contact search time | $3,250 | $2,600 | $3,900 |
| **TOTAL SECTION A** | **$8,937.50** | **$7,150** | **$10,725** |

## SECTION B: REVENUE YOU'RE LOSING TODAY

### Formula: Lost opportunities from fragmentation

**Note:** This section only includes revenue lost TODAY due to fragmentation. AR collection issues are captured in Section C as recovery opportunity (since consolidation enables systematic collection).

| Field | Value | Source | Rationale |
|-------|-------|--------|-----------|
| What is being lost? | **Contact invisibility + CRM waste** | Multiple meetings | 246:1 contact disparity |
| Contact disparity ratio | **246:1** | Plotter Mechanix-alyssa workflow | Kelsey 10,581 vs Andrew 2 |
| Capsule CRM unused | **$30/month** | DISCOVERY-FINDINGS | Paying but not using |

### Fireflies Evidence (Section B):

**Contact Disparity:**
> "Contact database disparity: Kelsey 10,581 vs Alyssa 43 vs Andrew 2"
> — Plotter Mechanix-alyssa workflow

This means:
- **246:1 ratio** between Kelsey's contacts and team average
- Team members cannot see or access customer information
- Customer relationships trapped in Kelsey's personal devices

**Unused CRM:**
> Capsule CRM: $30/month paid but unused due to fragmentation
> — DISCOVERY-FINDINGS

### Calculation (Section B):

```
Contact invisibility:     Lost opportunities from 246:1 disparity = $5,000-$10,000/year (conservative)
Capsule CRM waste:        $30 × 12 = $360/year
```

### Section B Summary:

| Loss Area | Annual LOW | Annual HIGH |
|-----------|------------|-------------|
| Contact invisibility | $5,000 | $10,000 |
| Capsule CRM unused | $360 | $360 |
| **TOTAL SECTION B** | **$5,360** | **$10,360** |

## SECTION C: NEW REVENUE THE SOLUTION UNLOCKS

### Formula: Activities × Conversion × Value × 12 months

**Note:** This section captures NEW revenue enabled by consolidated contact data. AR recovery is included here (not in Section B) because consolidation enables systematic collection that isn't happening today.

| Field | Value | Source | Rationale |
|-------|-------|--------|-----------|
| What does saved time enable? | **Systematic outreach + Andrew supplies visibility + service contracts** | Multiple meetings | Contact consolidation unlocks revenue |
| AR recovery rate with access | **70%** | Fireflies meeting | "When I call they pay" |
| Andrew's supply customer base | **100** | Estimated | Current contacts hidden |
| Average supply sale | **$500/year** | Industry estimate | Consumables |
| Service contract eligible | **20** | Jobber analysis | Customers with qualifying equipment |
| Service contract value | **$99/month** | Proposed rate | Maintenance agreement |
| Total contacts for activation | **1,000** | Conservative | From Kelsey's 10,581 |
| Activation conversion | **2%** | Conservative | With systematic outreach |
| Activation value | **$750** | Jobber mean | Per activated customer |

### Fireflies Evidence (Section C):

**AR Recovery Opportunity:**
> "When I call they're like, oh shit"
> — Kelsey (AR collection effectiveness)

With consolidated contacts, Alyssa can systematically call overdue accounts. This is NEW capability enabled by the solution.

**Andrew's Supplies Business:**
> "50% of work is NEW customers" (brand new contacts)
> — Plotter Mechanix-alyssa workflow

Andrew's supply sales are hidden because he cannot see customer equipment history or contact information.

**Service Contract Potential:**
> Customer equipment history trapped in Kelsey's head
> — Multiple meetings

Without visibility into what equipment customers have, service contracts cannot be systematically offered.

**Top Customer Activation:**
> Kelsey has 10,581 contacts vs Alyssa's 43 vs Andrew's 2
> — Plotter Mechanix-alyssa workflow

Consolidation enables activation campaigns to dormant customers.

### Calculation (Section C):

```
AR recovery:              5-10/month × 70% recovery × $750 × 12 = $31,500-$63,000/year
Andrew supplies:          100 customers × $500/year = $50,000/year
Service contracts:        20 eligible × $99/month × 12 = $23,760/year
Top customer activation:  1,000 contacts × 2% conversion × $750 = $15,000/year
```

### Section C Summary:

| Opportunity | Annual LOW | Annual HIGH |
|-------------|------------|-------------|
| AR systematic recovery | $31,500 | $63,000 |
| Andrew supplies visibility | $50,000 | $50,000 |
| Service contract renewals | $23,760 | $23,760 |
| Top customer activation | $15,000 | $15,000 |
| **TOTAL SECTION C** | **$120,260** | **$151,760** |

## TOTAL ANNUAL IMPACT (A + B + C)

| Section | Annual LOW | Annual HIGH | Status |
|---------|------------|-------------|--------|
| A: Time Cost (Duplicates + Sync) | $7,150 | $10,725 | COMPLETE |
| B: Lost Revenue (Fragmentation) | $5,360 | $10,360 | COMPLETE |
| C: Revenue Upside (Unified Access) | $120,260 | $151,760 | COMPLETE |
| **TOTAL Y** | **$132,770** | **$172,845** | **COMPLETE** |
