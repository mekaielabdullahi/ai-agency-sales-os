## SECTION A: WHAT THIS PROBLEM COSTS IN WASTED TIME

| Field | Value | Source | Rationale |
|-------|-------|--------|-----------|
| Training time per new tech (hours) | **160-200** | Meeting with Plotter_Kelsey | 20-30 hrs/week × 6 months intensive + ongoing |
| Number of hires per year | **2** | Business context | Growth plan requires additional techs |
| Kelsey's hourly rate (billable) | **$175** | Meeting with Plotter_Kelsey | Remote support rate validated |
| **ANNUAL TRAINING COST** | **$56,000-$70,000** | Calculated | 160-200 hrs × $175 × 2 hires |

| Field | Value | Source | Rationale |
|-------|-------|--------|-----------|
| Daily coordination time (hours) | **1** | Meeting with Plotter_Kelsey | Morning briefs + phone calls |
| Kelsey's hourly rate | **$175** | Meeting with Plotter_Kelsey | Billable rate |
| Working days per year | **260** | Standard | 52 weeks × 5 days |
| **ANNUAL COORDINATION COST** | **$45,500** | Calculated | 1 hr × $175 × 260 days |

| Field | Value | Source | Rationale |
|-------|-------|--------|-----------|
| Parts research time per order (hours) | **0.5-0.75** | Plotter Mechanix-alyssa workflow | 30-45 minutes per research session |
| Orders per week | **2-3** | Plotter Mechanix-alyssa workflow | Estimated from context |
| Alyssa's hourly rate | **$25** | User input | Administrative rate |
| **ANNUAL PARTS RESEARCH COST** | **$1,300-$2,925** | Calculated | 0.625 hrs × 2.5/week × $25 × 52 |

### Fireflies Evidence (Section A):

**Training Burden:**
> "20, 30 hours, 20, 30 hours initially... took me a good 3 months"
> — Joe (on Kelsey training time)

> "6 months before becoming fully independent"
> — Meeting with Plotter_Kelsey (Joe's training timeline)

> "40 hours/week during onboarding" for job shadowing
> — Meeting with Plotter_Kelsey

**Daily Coordination:**
> "~1 hour/day with all technicians" for collaboration
> — Meeting with Plotter_Kelsey

**Parts Research:**
> "It can take me about half an hour to try and figure it out because I don't know parts"
> — Alyssa (Plotter Mechanix-alyssa workflow)

> "30+ minutes with HP support" for parts identification
> — Plotter Mechanix-alyssa workflow

### Section A Summary:

| Cost Area | Annual LOW | Annual HIGH |
|-----------|------------|-------------|
| Training new techs | $56,000 | $70,000 |
| Daily coordination | $45,500 | $45,500 |
| Parts research | $1,300 | $2,925 |
| **TOTAL SECTION A** | **$102,800** | **$118,425** |

## SECTION B: REVENUE YOU'RE LOSING TODAY

| Field | Value | Source | Rationale |
|-------|-------|--------|-----------|
| What is being lost? | **Mistakes from knowledge gaps + escalation delays** | Multiple meetings | Wrong parts, customer wait time |
| Documented mistake | **$5,000** | Meeting with Plotter_Kelsey | HP ink mistake (wrong variant ordered) |
| Field escalation rate | **25%** | Meeting with Plotter_Kelsey | High complexity calls needing Kelsey |
| Service calls per week | **15-20** | Business context | Estimated from capacity |
| Lost productivity per escalation | **0.5 hrs** | Estimated | Wait time + context switching |
| **ANNUAL ESCALATION COST** | **$11,375-$22,750** | Calculated | See below |

### Escalation Cost Calculation:

```
Calls needing escalation:    15-20/week × 25% = 4-5 calls/week
Wait/switching time:         0.5 hrs × $175 (Kelsey rate while on call)
Weekly cost:                 4-5 × 0.5 × $175 = $350-$437.50
Annual cost:                 $350-$437.50 × 52 = $18,200-$22,750

Conservative (partial):      $11,375 (assuming 50% recoverable)
```

| Field | Value | Source | Rationale |
|-------|-------|--------|-----------|
| RMA backlog impact | **Unquantified** | Plotter Mechanix-alyssa workflow | "Stacks up" - vendors refuse after 30 days |
| RMA resolution time | **~1 week** | Plotter Mechanix-alyssa workflow | Negotiation with vendors |
| Estimated lost credits/year | **$2,000-$5,000** | Conservative estimate | Based on backlog description |

### Fireflies Evidence (Section B):

**Parts Mistakes:**
> "$5,000 mistake (wrong ink ordered)"
> — Meeting with Plotter_Kelsey (HP parts complexity)

> "HP parts complexity includes multiple variants (dye, UV, different sizes) with identical-looking print heads that are functionally different"
> — Meeting with Plotter_Kelsey

**Escalation Dependency:**
> "~25% of calls need Kelsey help (high complexity)"
> — Meeting with Plotter_Kelsey

> "~20-25% are completely new printer types requiring his expertise"
> — Meeting with Plotter_Kelsey

**RMA Backlog:**
> "RMA backlog 'stacks up'; vendors refuse returns after 30 days"
> — Plotter Mechanix-alyssa workflow

> "~1 week of negotiation with vendors"
> — Plotter Mechanix-alyssa workflow

### Section B Summary:

| Loss Area | Annual LOW | Annual HIGH |
|-----------|------------|-------------|
| Documented mistakes | $5,000 | $5,000 |
| Escalation delays | $11,375 | $22,750 |
| RMA lost credits | $2,000 | $5,000 |
| **TOTAL SECTION B** | **$18,375** | **$32,750** |
