# OPPORTUNITY 5: Knowledge Capture & Training System

## Solution Overview
Systematize knowledge transfer that currently depends on Kelsey. Includes video training library for tech onboarding, internal knowledge agent for parts/procedures lookup, and AI-assisted field support to reduce escalations.

---

## Methodology Notes

**Pattern Used:** A + B + C

**Why this pattern:**
- Section A captures time costs (training, coordination, parts research)
- Section B captures revenue lost TODAY (documented mistakes, RMA losses)
- Section C captures NEW capacity enabled (training efficiency, freed escalation time, consulting upside)

**What's NOT included (to avoid double-counting):**
- Escalation delays were REMOVED from Section B (they appear in Section C as "Freed escalation capacity")
- The same escalation hours cannot be counted as both a current loss AND future gain

**Audit Note:** Per Morningside AI methodology, Section B should only include revenue walking out the door that cannot be recovered, while Section C should include new activities enabled by freed time.

## SECTION A: WHAT THIS PROBLEM COSTS IN WASTED TIME

### Formula: Time × People × 260 days × Hourly Rate

| Field | Value | Source | Rationale |
|-------|-------|--------|-----------|
| Training time per new tech (hours) | **160-200** | Meeting with Plotter_Kelsey | 20-30 hrs/week × 6 months intensive + ongoing |
| Number of hires per year | **2** | Business context | Growth plan requires additional techs |
| Kelsey's hourly rate (billable) | **$175** | Meeting with Plotter_Kelsey | Remote support rate validated |
| **ANNUAL TRAINING COST** | **$56,000-$70,000** | Calculated | 160-200 hrs × $175 × 2 hires |

| Field | Value | Source | Rationale |
|-------|-------|--------|-----------|
| Daily coordination time (hours) | **1** | Meeting with Plotter_Kelsey | Morning briefs + phone calls |
| Kelsey's hourly rate | **$175** | Meeting with Plotter_Kelsey | Billable rate |
| Working days per year | **260** | Standard | 52 weeks × 5 days |
| **ANNUAL COORDINATION COST** | **$45,500** | Calculated | 1 hr × $175 × 260 days |

| Field | Value | Source | Rationale |
|-------|-------|--------|-----------|
| Parts research time per order (hours) | **0.5-0.75** | Plotter Mechanix-alyssa workflow | 30-45 minutes per research session |
| Orders per week | **2-3** | Plotter Mechanix-alyssa workflow | Estimated from context |
| Alyssa's hourly rate | **$25** | User input | Administrative rate |
| **ANNUAL PARTS RESEARCH COST** | **$1,300-$2,925** | Calculated | 0.625 hrs × 2.5/week × $25 × 52 |

### Fireflies Evidence (Section A):

**Training Burden:**
> "20, 30 hours, 20, 30 hours initially... took me a good 3 months"
> — Joe (on Kelsey training time)

> "6 months before becoming fully independent"
> — Meeting with Plotter_Kelsey (Joe's training timeline)

> "40 hours/week during onboarding" for job shadowing
> — Meeting with Plotter_Kelsey

**Daily Coordination:**
> "~1 hour/day with all technicians" for collaboration
> — Meeting with Plotter_Kelsey

**Parts Research:**
> "It can take me about half an hour to try and figure it out because I don't know parts"
> — Alyssa (Plotter Mechanix-alyssa workflow)

> "30+ minutes with HP support" for parts identification
> — Plotter Mechanix-alyssa workflow

### Section A Summary:

| Cost Area | Annual LOW | Annual HIGH |
|-----------|------------|-------------|
| Training new techs | $56,000 | $70,000 |
| Daily coordination | $45,500 | $45,500 |
| Parts research | $1,300 | $2,925 |
| **TOTAL SECTION A** | **$102,800** | **$118,425** |

---

## SECTION B: REVENUE YOU'RE LOSING TODAY

### Formula: Documented losses + recurring mistake costs

**Note:** This section only includes revenue lost TODAY that cannot be recovered through improved processes. Escalation-related costs are captured in Section C as freed capacity.

| Field | Value | Source | Rationale |
|-------|-------|--------|-----------|
| What is being lost? | **Mistakes from knowledge gaps** | Multiple meetings | Wrong parts, RMA losses |
| Documented mistake | **$5,000** | Meeting with Plotter_Kelsey | HP ink mistake (wrong variant ordered) |
| RMA backlog impact | **Unquantified** | Plotter Mechanix-alyssa workflow | "Stacks up" - vendors refuse after 30 days |
| Estimated lost credits/year | **$2,000-$5,000** | Conservative estimate | Based on backlog description |

### Fireflies Evidence (Section B):

**Parts Mistakes:**
> "$5,000 mistake (wrong ink ordered)"
> — Meeting with Plotter_Kelsey (HP parts complexity)

> "HP parts complexity includes multiple variants (dye, UV, different sizes) with identical-looking print heads that are functionally different"
> — Meeting with Plotter_Kelsey

**RMA Backlog:**
> "RMA backlog 'stacks up'; vendors refuse returns after 30 days"
> — Plotter Mechanix-alyssa workflow

> "~1 week of negotiation with vendors"
> — Plotter Mechanix-alyssa workflow

### Section B Summary:

| Loss Area | Annual LOW | Annual HIGH |
|-----------|------------|-------------|
| Documented mistakes | $5,000 | $5,000 |
| RMA lost credits | $2,000 | $5,000 |
| **TOTAL SECTION B** | **$7,000** | **$10,000** |

## SECTION C: NEW REVENUE THE SOLUTION UNLOCKS

### Formula: Activities × Conversion × Value × 12 months

**Note:** This section captures NEW capacity enabled by the solution, including freed escalation time that is DIFFERENT from Section B losses.

| Field | Value | Source | Rationale |
|-------|-------|--------|-----------|
| What does saved time enable? | **Faster tech independence + Kelsey freed for high-value work** | Multiple meetings | Training reduction + remote consulting model |
| Training time reduction | **75%** | Meeting with Plotter_Kelsey | From 160-200 hrs to 40-50 hrs per tech |
| Saved hours per hire | **120-150** | Calculated | 160 - 40 = 120 minimum |
| Hires per year | **2** | Business context | Growth plan |
| **ANNUAL TRAINING SAVINGS** | **$42,000-$52,500** | Calculated | 120-150 hrs × $175 × 2 |

| Field | Value | Source | Rationale |
|-------|-------|--------|-----------|
| Escalation reduction target | **50%** | Conservative | From 25% to 12.5% with knowledge base |
| Freed Kelsey hours/week | **2-3** | Calculated | 50% of current escalation time |
| **ANNUAL FREED CAPACITY** | **$18,200-$27,300** | Calculated | 2.5 hrs × $175 × 52 |

| Field | Value | Source | Rationale |
|-------|-------|--------|-----------|
| Remote consulting opportunity | **$175/hr** | Meeting with Plotter_Kelsey | Already operating at this rate |
| Additional consulting hrs/week | **5-10** | Meeting w/ Nikki | Pinetop vision enabled |
| **ANNUAL CONSULTING UPSIDE** | **$45,500-$91,000** | Calculated | 5-10 hrs × $175 × 52 |

### Fireflies Evidence (Section C):

**Training Reduction:**
> "1 month to 75% independence" (currently 6 months to full)
> — Meeting with Plotter_Kelsey

With video library + knowledge base, target: 4-6 weeks to 75% independence (vs current 1 month), full independence in 3 months (vs current 6 months).

**Single Point of Failure Resolution:**
> "Without him nothing would get done. He just has all that information in his brain."
> — Nicole (Meeting w/ Nikki)

> "Business cannot generate revenue without him"
> — Multiple meetings

**Remote Consulting Vision:**
> "Kelsey working remotely from balcony" (Pinetop vision)
> — Meeting w/ Nikki

> "Already operating; $175/hr phone consultations"
> — Meeting with Plotter_Kelsey

**Escalation Improvement (why this is in C, not B):**
> "~25% of calls need Kelsey help (high complexity)"
> — Meeting with Plotter_Kelsey

The knowledge base enables techs to resolve issues independently, FREEING Kelsey's time for higher-value work (consulting). This is capacity gained, not revenue currently being lost.

### Section C Summary:

| Opportunity | Annual LOW | Annual HIGH |
|-------------|------------|-------------|
| Training time savings | $42,000 | $52,500 |
| Freed escalation capacity | $18,200 | $27,300 |
| Remote consulting upside | $45,500 | $91,000 |
| **TOTAL SECTION C** | **$105,700** | **$170,800** |

| A: Time Cost (Training + Coordination) | $102,800 | $118,425 | COMPLETE |
| B: Lost Revenue (Mistakes + RMA) | $7,000 | $10,000 | COMPLETE |
| C: Revenue Upside (Freed Capacity) | $105,700 | $170,800 | COMPLETE |
| **TOTAL Y** | **$215,500** | **$299,225** | **COMPLETE** |

## KEY VALIDATION QUOTE

> "Without him nothing would get done. He just has all that information in his brain."
> — Nicole, Plotter Mechanix

**ROI Justification:**
Reducing Kelsey's training burden by 75% per hire saves $42,000-$52,500 annually. Freeing 5-10 hours/week for remote consulting adds $45,500-$91,000 in high-margin revenue. Total opportunity: $215,500-$299,225/year.
