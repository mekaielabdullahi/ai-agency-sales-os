Annual Time Cost = (Quotes/week × Time/quote × Hourly rate × 52)
```

```
Annual Lost Revenue = (Lost quotes/week × Quote value × Win rate × 52)
```

**Section C: Revenue Upside**

Annual Revenue Upside = (Unpursued quotes/week × Value × Conversion rate × 52)
```

**Total Y (Annual ROI):**

Y = Section A + Section B + Section C
```

## IMPORTANT NOTE

Per DISCOVERY-UNKNOWNS.md, Plotter Mechanix is described as **"NOT QUOTE-BASED - Service business"** with most calls being service/repair calls.

If Fireflies search confirms this, Quote Generation Automation may NOT be a priority opportunity. The current ROI calculator focuses on:
1. Email & Communication Hub

3. Inventory & Barcode System
4. Parts Catalog & Knowledge Base
5. Training System
6. Morning Coordination

Quote generation is bundled under "Unified Operations Platform" with other features.
