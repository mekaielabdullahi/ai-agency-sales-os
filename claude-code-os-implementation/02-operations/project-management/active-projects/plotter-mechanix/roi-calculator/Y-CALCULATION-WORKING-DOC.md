## Line Item 1: Quote Generation Automation

### Section A: Time Cost - COMPLETE

| Input | Value | Source |
|-------|-------|--------|
| Time wasted per day (hrs) | 0.375 | Calculated: (2.5 quotes × 45 min) ÷ 5 days |
| Number of people | 1 | Alyssa |
| Working days/year | 260 | Standard |
| Loaded hourly cost | $22 | User input |

**Calculation:**
```
Annual Cost = 0.375 hrs × 1 person × 260 days × $22/hr
Annual Cost = $2,145/year
```

### Section B: Lost Revenue - COMPLETE

| Input | Value | Source |
|-------|-------|--------|
| What's being lost | Leads "slip through cracks" + mistakes | Fireflies + Discovery |
| Documented mistake | $5,000 (Tucson trip - wrong part) | Fireflies meeting |
| Unfollowed quotes | 15+ quotes with no follow-up | "15 quotes I sent out that I never followed up on" |
| Quote value | $1,500-$3,000/job | Service job pricing |
| Lost conversion (est) | 50% of unfollowed quotes | Industry standard |

**Calculation (Conservative):**
```
Lost from unfollowed quotes: 15 quotes × 50% lost × $2,000 avg = $15,000/month
Lost from mistakes: $5,000/year (documented)
Annual Lost Revenue = ($15,000 × 12) + $5,000 = $185,000/year
```

**Section B Summary:**
| Scenario | Annual Value |
|----------|--------------|
| Conservative (documented only) | $5,000 |
| With Unfollowed Quotes | $185,000 |

## Supporting Data: Fireflies Meeting (Alyssa Workflow)

### Manual Tasks Eliminated by Solution:
1. **Surcharge Calculations** - 3.5% via Google Calculator -> Automated
2. **Copy/Paste Operations** - Quo -> Jobber -> Centralized holding area
3. **Email Sorting** - Multiple inboxes -> Unified communication platform
4. **Contact Management** - Manual sync -> Auto-sync across Quo, Jobber, Capsule

### Business Context:
- **50% of work is NEW customers** (brand new contacts)
- **Contact database disparity:** Kelsey 10,581 vs Alyssa 43 vs Andrew 2
- **$5,000 documented mistake** - wrong part due to manual confusion

### Critical Quote from Kelsey:
> "I've got like 15 quotes I sent out that I never followed up on, and I don't know what the status"

---

## ROI Justification

One additional service job per week ($2,000-$3,000) or one equipment sale per month ($10,000+) pays for the entire solution.
