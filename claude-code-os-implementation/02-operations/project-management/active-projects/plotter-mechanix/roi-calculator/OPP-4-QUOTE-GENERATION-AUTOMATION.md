# OPPORTUNITY 4: Quote Generation Automation

## Solution Overview
Automate the quote creation, tracking, and follow-up process. Centralizes quotes from Quo/Jobber, auto-calculates surcharges, syncs contacts across systems (Quo, Jobber, Capsule), and triggers systematic follow-up sequences for pending quotes.

## SECTION A: WHAT THIS PROBLEM COSTS IN WASTED TIME

| Field | Value | Source | Rationale |
|-------|-------|--------|-----------|
| Time wasted per person per day (hours) | **1.5** | Fireflies - Alyssa Workflow | Conservative: Quote generation + invoicing portion of 5-8 hr daily admin burden |
| Number of people doing this task | **1** | Fireflies - Alyssa Workflow | Alyssa handles quote entry and processing |
| Working days per year | **260** | Standard | Default (52 wks × 5 days) |
| Loaded hourly cost ($) | **$22** | User input | Based on role compensation |
| **ANNUAL COST OF INEFFICIENCY** | **$8,580** | Calculated | 1.5 × 1 × 260 × $22 |

### Fireflies Evidence (Section A):

**Time Pressure Quotes:**
> "I'm so behind"
> — Alyssa

> "by the end of the day, there's like 40 things in there"
> — Kelsey (on daily item backlog)

> "I've got emails to go through. I've got calls to look through. I've got texts to go through."
> — Alyssa (on multi-channel workload)

> "the two hours that we recorded"
> — Trent (referencing screen recording duration)

**Manual Tasks Identified:**
1. Surcharge Calculations - 3.5% via Google Calculator
2. Copy/Paste Operations - Quo to Jobber
3. Contact Management - Manual sync across Quo, Jobber, Capsule

### Estimated Time Breakdown (Full Administrative Burden):

| Task | Daily Hours | Notes |
|------|-------------|-------|
| Email sorting & filtering | 1-2 hrs | Multiple inboxes managed |
| Quo request processing | 2-3 hrs | Copy/paste/search workflow |
| Quote generation/invoicing | 1-2 hrs | 5-10 quotes workflow estimate |
| Contact management | 1 hr | Manual sync across systems |
| **Total Estimated** | **5-8 hrs** | Context-based estimate |

### Data Limitations (Honest Disclosure):
The following data points were **NOT explicitly specified** in the Fireflies transcript:
- Exact hours per day spent on quotes
- Time per quote generation
- Number of quotes generated per day/week
- Specific count of calls/emails daily

**Calculation Approach:**
- **Conservative (used):** 1.5 hrs/day = Quote processing portion → $8,580/year
- **Full burden (alternative):** 6 hrs/day = Midpoint of 5-8 hr estimate → $34,320/year

## SECTION B: REVENUE YOU'RE LOSING TODAY

| Field | Value | Source | Rationale |
|-------|-------|--------|-----------|
| What is being lost? | **Quotes slipping through cracks + mistakes** | Fireflies - Kelsey | Leads not followed up, wrong parts ordered |
| Volume affected per month | **15** | Fireflies - Kelsey | "15 quotes I sent out that I never followed up on" |
| % lost due to this problem | **50%** | Industry benchmark | Conservative estimate for unfollowed quotes |
| Value per unit ($) | **$2,000** | Discovery + Fireflies | Average service job: $1,500-$3,000 |
| **ANNUAL LOST REVENUE** | **$180,000** | Calculated | 15 × 50% × $2,000 × 12 months |

### Fireflies Evidence (Section B):

**Quote 1 - Unfollowed Quotes (Kelsey):**
> "I've got like 15 quotes I sent out that I never followed up on, and I don't know what the status"

**Quote 2 - Documented $5,000 Mistake:**
> "We had the Tucson trip where the wrong part was ordered... that was a $5,000 mistake"

**Calculation Notes:**
- Conservative: $5,000/year (documented mistake only)
- With unfollowed quotes: $180,000/year + $5,000 mistake = **$185,000/year**

## SECTION C: NEW REVENUE THE SOLUTION UNLOCKS

| Field | Value | Source | Rationale |
|-------|-------|--------|-----------|
| What does saved time enable? | **Systematic quote follow-up & revenue activities** | Fireflies - Multiple | Staff can focus on AR, upsells, equipment sales |
| Additional revenue-generating activities per month | **See breakdown** | Fireflies | Multiple revenue streams enabled |
| Conversion / success rate (%) | **40-80%** | Fireflies | "When I call they're like, oh shit" (AR collections) |
| Value per conversion ($) | **$500-$15,000** | Fireflies | Varies by activity type |

### Revenue Opportunity Breakdown:

| Opportunity | Activities/Mo | Conversion | Value/Each | Monthly | Annual | Fireflies Evidence |
|-------------|---------------|------------|------------|---------|--------|-------------------|
| Quote Follow-up | 15-20 quotes | 40-50% | $1,500-$3,000 | $4,500-$21,000 | $54,000-$252,000 | "15 quotes I never followed up on" |
| AR Collections | 5-10 accounts | 70-80% | $500-$1,500 | $2,500-$15,000 | $30,000-$180,000 | "When I call they're like, oh shit" |
| Supply Sales | 5-8 opportunities | 80-90% | $500-$2,000 | $2,500-$16,000 | $30,000-$192,000 | Andrew can proactively sell consumables |
| Equipment Upgrades | 1-2 opportunities | 80-90% | $6,000-$15,000 | $6,000-$30,000 | $72,000-$360,000 | "Replacing old OSA with HP" |
| Customer Retention | 2-3 customers | 80% | $2,000-$5,000 | $4,000-$15,000 | $48,000-$180,000 | Alyssa's customer communication |

| **ANNUAL REVENUE FROM FREED CAPACITY** | **LOW** | **HIGH** |
|----------------------------------------|---------|----------|
| **Total** | **$234,000** | **$1,164,000** |

### Fireflies Evidence (Section C):

**AR Collections:**
> "When I call them they're like, 'oh shit, I'm so sorry, let me pay that right now'"
> — Demonstrating high conversion when follow-up actually happens

**Contact Database Disparity:**
> "Kelsey has 10,581 contacts... Alyssa has 43... Andrew has 2"
> — Shows visibility problem preventing proactive sales

**New Customer Volume:**
> "About 50% of the work is brand new customers"
> — High volume of new contacts not being captured/nurtured

## TOTAL ANNUAL IMPACT (A + B + C)

| Section | Annual LOW | Annual HIGH | Status |
|---------|------------|-------------|--------|
| A: Time Cost (Inefficiency) | $8,580 | $8,580 | COMPLETE (Revised) |
| B: Lost Revenue | $5,000 | $185,000 | COMPLETE |
| C: Revenue Upside | $234,000 | $1,164,000 | COMPLETE |

## SOLUTION COST INPUTS (For ROI Calculation)

| Field | Value | Notes |
|-------|-------|-------|
| Solution implementation cost ($) | TBD | Phase 2 scope |
| Annual tool/license cost ($) | TBD | Platform fees |
| Total first-year cost | TBD | Implementation + Year 1 |

### ROI Preview (If solution costs $20,000):
- **ROI (Conservative):** $247,580 ÷ $20,000 = **12.4x**
- **ROI (Full):** $1,357,580 ÷ $20,000 = **67.9x**
- **Payback:** < 1 month

## SECTION D: REFERENCE DATA & ASSUMPTIONS

| Field | Value | Source |
|-------|-------|--------|
| Business type | Plotter/Printer Service | Discovery |
| Service area | Phoenix, AZ metro | Discovery |
| Team size | 3 (Kelsey, Alyssa, Andrew) | Fireflies |

## KEY VALIDATION QUOTE

> "I've got like 15 quotes I sent out that I never followed up on, and I don't know what the status"
> — Kelsey, Plotter Mechanix

**ROI Justification:**
One additional service job per week ($2,000-$3,000) or one equipment sale per month ($10,000+) pays for the entire solution.
