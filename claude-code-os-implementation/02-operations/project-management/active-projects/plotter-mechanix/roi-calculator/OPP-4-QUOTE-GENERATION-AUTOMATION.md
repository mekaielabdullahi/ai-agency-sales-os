# OPPORTUNITY 4: Quote Generation Automation

## Solution Overview
Automate the quote creation, tracking, and follow-up process. Centralizes quotes from Quo/Jobber, auto-calculates surcharges, syncs contacts across systems (Quo, Jobber, Capsule), and triggers systematic follow-up sequences for pending quotes.

## SECTION A: WHAT THIS PROBLEM COSTS IN WASTED TIME

| Field | Value | Source | Rationale |
|-------|-------|--------|-----------|
| Time wasted per person per day (hours) | **1.5** | Fireflies - Alyssa Workflow | Conservative: Quote generation + invoicing portion of 5-8 hr daily admin burden |
| Number of people doing this task | **1** | Fireflies - Alyssa Workflow | Alyssa handles quote entry and processing |
| Working days per year | **260** | Standard | Default (52 wks × 5 days) |
| Loaded hourly cost ($) | **$22** | User input | Based on role compensation |
| **ANNUAL COST OF INEFFICIENCY** | **$8,580** | Calculated | 1.5 × 1 × 260 × $22 |

### Fireflies Evidence (Section A):

**Time Pressure Quotes:**
> "I'm so behind"
> — Alyssa

> "by the end of the day, there's like 40 things in there"
> — Kelsey (on daily item backlog)

> "I've got emails to go through. I've got calls to look through. I've got texts to go through."
> — Alyssa (on multi-channel workload)

> "the two hours that we recorded"
> — Trent (referencing screen recording duration)

**Manual Tasks Identified:**
1. Surcharge Calculations - 3.5% via Google Calculator
2. Copy/Paste Operations - Quo to Jobber
3. Contact Management - Manual sync across Quo, Jobber, Capsule

### Estimated Time Breakdown (Full Administrative Burden):

| Task | Daily Hours | Notes |
|------|-------------|-------|
| Email sorting & filtering | 1-2 hrs | Multiple inboxes managed |
| Quo request processing | 2-3 hrs | Copy/paste/search workflow |
| Quote generation/invoicing | 1-2 hrs | 5-10 quotes workflow estimate |
| Contact management | 1 hr | Manual sync across systems |
| **Total Estimated** | **5-8 hrs** | Context-based estimate |

### Data Limitations (Honest Disclosure):
The following data points were **NOT explicitly specified** in the Fireflies transcript:
- Exact hours per day spent on quotes
- Time per quote generation
- Number of quotes generated per day/week
- Specific count of calls/emails daily

**Calculation Approach:**
- **Conservative (used):** 1.5 hrs/day = Quote processing portion → $8,580/year
- **Full burden (alternative):** 6 hrs/day = Midpoint of 5-8 hr estimate → $34,320/year

## SECTION B: REVENUE YOU'RE LOSING TODAY

| Field | Value | Source | Rationale |
|-------|-------|--------|-----------|
| What is being lost? | **Quote conversion opportunity + mistakes** | Fireflies - Kelsey | Low follow-up = low close rate |
| Estimated quotes per month | **16-20** | Calculated | 4-5 quotes/week (see Volume Analysis) |
| Current close rate | **15-20%** | Industry benchmark | Unmanaged quote follow-up |
| Potential close rate | **60-70%** | Industry benchmark | Systematic follow-up |
| Conversion opportunity gap | **45-50%** | Calculated | Potential minus current |
| Value per conversion ($) | **$750** | Jobber data | Mean of 460 service invoices |
| **ANNUAL LOST REVENUE** | **$54,000-$95,000** | Calculated | See calculation below |

### Quote Volume Analysis

**Kelsey's "15 quotes" statement:**
> "I've got like 15 quotes I sent out that I never followed up on"
> — Kelsey (Feb 11, 2026)

**Interpretation:** This is a point-in-time snapshot of pending quotes with no follow-up, NOT monthly volume.

**Estimated Weekly Quote Volume:**
- 50% of work = new customers (Fireflies)
- New customers typically require quotes before service
- Conservative estimate: 4-5 quotes generated per week
- Monthly volume: 16-20 quotes

### Fireflies Evidence (Section B):

**Quote 1 - Unfollowed Quotes (Kelsey):**
> "I've got like 15 quotes I sent out that I never followed up on, and I don't know what the status"

**Quote 2 - Documented $5,000 Mistake:**
> "We had the Tucson trip where the wrong part was ordered... that was a $5,000 mistake"

### Calculation (Conversion Opportunity Framework):

```
Monthly quotes:              16-20
Current close rate:          ~18% (midpoint of 15-20%)
Potential close rate:        ~65% (midpoint of 60-70%)

Current conversions/month:   16-20 × 18% = 3-4 jobs
Potential conversions/month: 16-20 × 65% = 10-13 jobs
MISSED conversions/month:    6-10 jobs
```

**Annual Lost Revenue:**
```
Conservative: 6 missed × $750 × 12 months = $54,000/year
Aggressive:   10 missed × $750 × 12 months = $90,000/year
Plus documented mistake:                   + $5,000/year
```

| Scenario | Annual Lost Revenue |
|----------|---------------------|
| LOW (documented only) | $5,000 |
| HIGH (conversion gap + mistake) | $95,000 |

### Jobber Invoice Analysis (Value per Unit):
**Source:** Plotter Mechanix Jobber export (1,730 invoices, Feb 2026)

| Metric | Service Calls |
|--------|---------------|
| Count | 460 |
| Mean | $746.58 |
| Median | $426.94 |
| 75th percentile | $806.25 |

**Value used:** $750 (rounded mean) - accounts for mix of routine repairs ($200-500) and complex jobs ($1,000+).

**Note:** Kelsey's verbal estimate of "$1,500-$3,000" likely refers to larger, complex jobs (top 20% of service calls). The real Jobber data shows 46% of service calls are $200-500 (simple repairs).

## SECTION C: NEW REVENUE THE SOLUTION UNLOCKS

| Field | Value | Source | Rationale |
|-------|-------|--------|-----------|
| What does saved time enable? | **Systematic quote follow-up & revenue activities** | Fireflies - Multiple | Staff can focus on AR, upsells, equipment sales |
| Additional revenue-generating activities per month | **See breakdown** | Fireflies | Multiple revenue streams enabled |
| Conversion / success rate (%) | **40-80%** | Fireflies | "When I call they're like, oh shit" (AR collections) |
| Value per conversion ($) | **$500-$15,000** | Fireflies | Varies by activity type |

### Revenue Opportunity Breakdown:

| Opportunity | Activities/Mo | Conversion | Value/Each | Monthly | Annual | Fireflies Evidence |
|-------------|---------------|------------|------------|---------|--------|-------------------|
| Quote Follow-up | 15-20 quotes | 40-50% | $1,500-$3,000 | $4,500-$21,000 | $54,000-$252,000 | "15 quotes I never followed up on" |
| AR Collections | 5-10 accounts | 70-80% | $500-$1,500 | $2,500-$15,000 | $30,000-$180,000 | "When I call they're like, oh shit" |
| Supply Sales | 5-8 opportunities | 80-90% | $500-$2,000 | $2,500-$16,000 | $30,000-$192,000 | Andrew can proactively sell consumables |
| Equipment Upgrades | 1-2 opportunities | 80-90% | $6,000-$15,000 | $6,000-$30,000 | $72,000-$360,000 | "Replacing old OSA with HP" |
| Customer Retention | 2-3 customers | 80% | $2,000-$5,000 | $4,000-$15,000 | $48,000-$180,000 | Alyssa's customer communication |

| **ANNUAL REVENUE FROM FREED CAPACITY** | **LOW** | **HIGH** |
|----------------------------------------|---------|----------|
| **Total** | **$234,000** | **$1,164,000** |

### Fireflies Evidence (Section C):

**AR Collections:**
> "When I call them they're like, 'oh shit, I'm so sorry, let me pay that right now'"
> — Demonstrating high conversion when follow-up actually happens

**Contact Database Disparity:**
> "Kelsey has 10,581 contacts... Alyssa has 43... Andrew has 2"
> — Shows visibility problem preventing proactive sales

**New Customer Volume:**
> "About 50% of the work is brand new customers"
> — High volume of new contacts not being captured/nurtured

## SOLUTION COST INPUTS (For ROI Calculation)

| Field | Value | Notes |
|-------|-------|-------|
| Solution implementation cost ($) | TBD | Phase 2 scope |
| Annual tool/license cost ($) | TBD | Platform fees |
| Total first-year cost | TBD | Implementation + Year 1 |

### ROI Preview (If solution costs $20,000):
- **ROI (Conservative):** $247,580 ÷ $20,000 = **12.4x**
- **ROI (Full):** $1,357,580 ÷ $20,000 = **67.9x**
- **Payback:** < 1 month

## SECTION D: REFERENCE DATA & ASSUMPTIONS

| Field | Value | Source |
|-------|-------|--------|
| Business type | Plotter/Printer Service | Discovery |
| Service area | Phoenix, AZ metro | Discovery |
| Team size | 3 (Kelsey, Alyssa, Andrew) | Fireflies |
| Average service job | $1,500-$3,000 | Fireflies |
| Average equipment sale | $6,000-$15,000 | Fireflies |
| New customer rate | ~50% of jobs | Fireflies |

## KEY VALIDATION QUOTE

> "I've got like 15 quotes I sent out that I never followed up on, and I don't know what the status"
> — Kelsey, Plotter Mechanix

**ROI Justification:**
One additional service job per week ($2,000-$3,000) or one equipment sale per month ($10,000+) pays for the entire solution.
