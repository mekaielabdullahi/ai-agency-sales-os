# Solution: After-Hours Voice Assistant

## Problem Statement

After-hours calls currently interrupt personal time, go unanswered, or result in lost opportunities. There's no systematic way to capture service requests, provide basic troubleshooting, or book appointments when the office is closed.

## Solution Overview

Deploy Quo Sona integration as an after-hours voice assistant that captures messages, books appointments in Jobber, provides basic troubleshooting guidance, and ensures no opportunity is lost outside business hours. This is a testing phase deployment for nights and weekends only.
