# Solution: Remote Consulting Platform

## Problem Statement

Kelsey's expertise is limited by physical presence - he can only be in one place at a time. Travel time reduces billable hours, and there's no way to monetize expertise when working from Pinetop or during off-hours.

## Solution Overview

Create a remote consulting platform that enables Kelsey to diagnose problems via video/photos, provide expert guidance without travel, and command premium pricing ($300-375/hr) for specialized knowledge. This transforms Kelsey from technician to consultant.
