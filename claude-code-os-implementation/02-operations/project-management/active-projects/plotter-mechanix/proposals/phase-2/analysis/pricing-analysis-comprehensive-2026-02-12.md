# Comprehensive Pricing Analysis: Phase 2 Plotter Mechanix

**Date:** February 12, 2026
**Purpose:** Bridge client-facing ROI messaging with internal profitability analysis
**Status:** CRITICAL - Decision Required
**Framework Sources:** AAA Accelerator & Richard's 5-Model Pricing Matrix

---

## Executive Summary

### The Pricing Dilemma

We face a critical disconnect between value creation and margin capture:

- **Client-facing:** $153,600 in measurable Year 1 ROI
- **Internal reality:** Current prices yield 2-18% margins (essentially unprofitable)
- **Industry standard:** 2-3x markup (AAA framework) or 2.5:1 value-to-price ratio
- **Our current position:** Far below industry standards, risking unsustainability

### Strategic Recommendations

1. **Immediate:** Quote Phase 2B at $32,000 minimum (up from $28k)
2. **Alternative:** Progressive weekly model at $8,000-12,000 over 4 weeks
3. **Critical:** Reduce contact database scope OR use junior/AI resources
4. **Long-term:** Transition to value-based pricing (30-40% of ROI)

### Risk Factors

- **Kelsey Chaos Factor:** Historically causes 2x overhead (confirmed by patterns)
- **Vendor Fatigue:** 2-3 failed implementations = trust deficit
- **Contact Database:** 25-35+ hours for consolidation (major cost driver)
- **Adoption Risk:** Systems exist but aren't followed (Megan's 6-month work unused)

## Framework Analysis

### AAA Accelerator Application (Pricing Perfection PDF)

**Core Principle:** 3x markup for intermediate agencies

| Stage | Markup | Our Current | Where We Should Be |
|-------|--------|-------------|-------------------|
| Beginner | 2x | - | Past this |
| **Intermediate** | **3-5x** | **1.5-2x** | **3x minimum** |
| Advanced | Value-based | Not yet | Future goal |

**The Value Formula:**
```
Price = (Skills + Experience) × Reusability × Market Position
```

**Our Application:**
- Skills: AI automation, integration expertise
- Experience: Multiple successful implementations
- Reusability: 60% of work can be templated
- **Result:** Should be charging 3x cost minimum

### Richard's 5-Model Matrix Application

**Model Comparison for Plotter Mechanix:**

| Model | Structure | Phase 2 Application | Profit Margin |
|-------|-----------|-------------------|---------------|
| **Hourly** | $40-120/hr | Not recommended | 20-40% |
| **Project** | Fixed scope | Current approach | 2-18% (TOO LOW) |
| **Productized** | 20-30% of custom | Could reduce to $20k | 40-50% |
| **Retainer** | $1,500-4,000/mo | Post-implementation | 60-70% |
| **Subscription** | $2,000-4,000/mo | Future Phase 3+ | 70-80% |

**Key Insight:** We're using project pricing but at hourly margins - worst of both worlds.

## Final Verdict

### The Math Doesn't Lie

At current pricing, we're essentially subsidizing Plotter Mechanix's growth with our margins. This is neither sustainable nor strategic unless:

1. They commit to significant future work at proper pricing
2. We radically change our resource model (junior/AI heavy)
3. We position this as a loss-leader for a case study

### Recommendation

**Primary:** Negotiate to $32,000 for Phase 2B with adjusted scope
**Alternative:** Progressive weekly model starting at $4,000
**Minimum:** If accepting current pricing, enforce ironclad boundaries and use 80% junior/AI resources

The choice is between professional pricing that sustains our business or accepting that this is a portfolio-building exercise with minimal profit. There is no middle ground at these price points.
