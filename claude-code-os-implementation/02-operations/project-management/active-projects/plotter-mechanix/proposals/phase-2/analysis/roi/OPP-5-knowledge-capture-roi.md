## Problem Statement

> "Without him nothing would get done. He just has all that information in his brain." — Nicole (Kelsey's wife)

> "It takes 160-200 hours to train each new tech. All the knowledge is in my head." — Kelsey

Kelsey is the single point of failure. His knowledge is trapped in his head, making training slow and scaling impossible.

## Current State

| Metric | Value | Source |
|--------|-------|--------|
| New tech training time | 6 months | Kelsey interview |
| Training hours per tech | 160-200h | Kelsey estimate |
| Joe independence level | 65% | Team observation |
| Kelsey's knowledge capture | 0% | No documentation |
| Time Kelsey spends training | 10+ hrs/week | Interview |

---

## Investment

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Dev Hours | 32h (MVP pessimistic) |
| Investment | $4,560 |
| Blended Rate | $147/hr |
| Timeline | Milestone 2-3 (Weeks 3-6) |

### What Gets Built (MVP)
1. Sona AI knowledge base with 50+ indexed documents
2. 5 core training videos (MVP)
3. Operations runbook for Alyssa (written SOPs)
4. Voice/text search for field techs
5. Foundation for full 15-video library (Phase 3)

## ROI Calculation

### Training Time Reduction

| Scenario | Before | After | Savings per Tech |
|----------|--------|-------|------------------|
| Training time | 6 months | 6-8 weeks | 4-5 months |
| Training hours | 180h | 60h | 120h |
| Cost per tech (@$50/hr) | $9,000 | $3,000 | **$6,000** |

### Joe Independence Upgrade

| Metric | Before | After | Impact |
|--------|--------|-------|--------|
| Independence level | 65% | 90% | +25% |
| Jobs handled solo | 60% | 85% | +25% |
| Kelsey callbacks | 8/week | 2/week | -6/week |
| Callback time | 30 min each | — | -3 hrs/week |
| **Annual Kelsey time saved** | | | **156 hrs** |

### Kelsey Time Liberation

| Activity | Current | After KB | Savings |
|----------|---------|----------|---------|
| Training Joe | 10 hrs/week | 3 hrs/week | 7 hrs |
| Answering tech questions | 5 hrs/week | 1 hr/week | 4 hrs |
| Documenting procedures | 0 | Built-in | — |
| **Weekly savings** | | | **11 hrs** |
| **Annual savings** | | | **572 hrs** |

### Value of Kelsey's Time
- Current billable rate: $150/hr
- Potential consulting rate: $300-500/hr

| Scenario | Hours | Rate | Value |
|----------|-------|------|-------|
| **Kelsey billable time recovered** | 572h | $150 | **$85,800** |
| **Kelsey consulting potential** | 572h | $300 | **$171,600** |

## Comprehensive Annual Impact

### Conservative Scenario
| Component | Annual Value |
|-----------|--------------|
| Training cost reduction (1 tech) | $6,000 |
| Kelsey time recovered | $85,800 |
| Joe productivity increase | $15,000 |
| Reduced errors/rework | $5,000 |
| **Total Conservative** | **$111,800** |

### Optimistic Scenario
| Component | Annual Value |
|-----------|--------------|
| Training cost reduction (2 techs) | $12,000 |
| Kelsey consulting potential | $171,600 |
| Joe full independence | $30,000 |
| New tech onboarding | $18,000 |
| Quality improvements | $10,000 |
| **Total Optimistic** | **$241,600** |

## ROI Summary

| Scenario | Annual Impact | Investment | ROI | Payback |
|----------|---------------|------------|-----|---------|
| **Conservative** | $111,800 | $4,560 | **24x** | **2 weeks** |
| **Likely** | $175,000 | $4,560 | **38x** | **1.5 weeks** |
| **Optimistic** | $241,600 | $4,560 | **53x** | **1 week** |

### Strategic Value (Not Quantified)
- Single point of failure eliminated
- Business sellable/transferable
- Scale from 1 tech to 3+ techs possible
- Kelsey can take vacations

---

## Success Metrics

### Phase 2 Success = All True
- [ ] 50+ documents indexed in Sona KB
- [ ] 5 core training videos delivered
- [ ] Joe using KB daily for reference
- [ ] Alyssa operations runbook complete
- [ ] Kelsey training time reduced 50%+

### 90-Day Targets
- Joe independence: 65% → 85%
- Kelsey training hours: 10/week → 4/week
- KB queries: 20+/week
- Training video views: 50+/month

---

## Risk Factors

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|-------------|--------|------------|
| Kelsey doesn't contribute content | Medium | High | Schedule filming sessions |
| Joe doesn't adopt KB | Low | Medium | Training + incentives |
| Content becomes outdated | Medium | Low | Update process built-in |

---

## Confidence Level

**HIGH** — Training costs are real, Kelsey's time is valuable, Joe needs this.

---

## Phase 3 Enhancement

Full 15-video library would add:
- 10 additional training videos
- Certification system
- Self-paced learning paths
- Estimated additional ROI: 30% uplift
