# Internal Package Analysis: Phase 2 Delivery Strategy

**Date:** February 12, 2026
**Purpose:** Internal review of Phase 2A/2B/2C packages for delivery confidence and profitability
**Status:** INTERNAL ONLY - Do not share with client

---

## Critical Questions & Answers

### 1. Are we willing to deliver each package without scope changes once promised?

**Phase 2A ($15,000) - CONCERN LEVEL: HIGH**
- At $15k for 4 weeks, this is ~$3,750/week or $750/day
- With 2 developers, that's $375/day per developer
- **Verdict:** This is below our cost if we use senior developers
- **Recommendation:** Either increase to $18-20k OR use junior developer + AI agents

**Phase 2B ($28,000) - CONFIDENCE LEVEL: MEDIUM**
- At $28k for 6 weeks, this is ~$4,667/week or $933/day
- More reasonable but still tight with contact consolidation complexity
- **Verdict:** Doable but no margin for scope creep
- **Recommendation:** Lock scope tightly, use change orders for additions

**Phase 2C ($45,000) - CONFIDENCE LEVEL: HIGH**
- At $45k for 8 weeks, this is ~$5,625/week or $1,125/day
- Sufficient margin for quality delivery
- **Verdict:** Comfortable delivery with profit margin
- **Recommendation:** This is our sweet spot

## 2. Timeline Reality Check

### Phase 2A (4 weeks) - What's Actually Possible

**Week 1:**
- Andrew discovery (3 hrs)
- Basic automation setup
- 2-3 training videos

**Week 2:**
- Stakeholder interviews
- Email consolidation
- 3-4 more videos

**Week 3:**
- Basic supplies system
- Voice assistant setup
- Testing

**Week 4:**
- Refinements
- Documentation
- Handoff

**RISK:** Very tight timeline, no buffer for issues

### Phase 2B (6 weeks) - More Realistic

**Weeks 1-2:** Discovery and planning
**Weeks 3-4:** Core development (contact DB, automation)
**Weeks 5-6:** Testing, refinement, training

**RISK:** Contact consolidation could eat entire timeline if data is messy

### Phase 2C (8 weeks) - Comfortable Delivery

**Weeks 1-2:** Full discovery and architecture
**Weeks 3-5:** Development sprint
**Weeks 6-7:** Integration and testing
**Week 8:** Training and handoff

**RISK:** Low - sufficient time for quality delivery

## 3. What to Scrap if They Take 2A ($15k)?

### MUST CUT from 2A:
- Contact consolidation (save 20+ hours)
- Advanced automations
- Customer portal
- Comprehensive video library (do 5 instead of 10)
- Multiple stakeholder interviews (do 2-3 max)

### BARE MINIMUM 2A Delivery:
1. Andrew discovery and basic tools (10 hrs)
2. 5 essential training videos (10 hrs)
3. Email consolidation (5 hrs)
4. Voice assistant test setup (5 hrs)
5. Basic documentation (5 hrs)
= 35 hours total @ $428/hr = $15,000

---

## 4. Are We Happy Delivering for $15k?

**Honest Answer: NO**

**Why Not:**
- Barely covers costs
- No margin for issues
- Sets bad precedent
- Kelsey will scope creep
- We're establishing ourselves as premium, not budget

**Alternative Approaches:**
1. **Minimum:** $20k for Phase 2A with reduced scope
2. **Preferred:** Push them to 2B at $28k
3. **Strategic:** Offer $15k as "Discovery Only" - 2 weeks of analysis and planning, then separate implementation contract

---

## 5. Dial Up/Down Components by Package Level

### Training Videos
- **2A:** 5 videos (bare essentials)
- **2B:** 15 videos (comprehensive basics)
- **2C:** 30 videos (complete library)
- **Effort:** 2 hrs per video average

### Contact Database
- **2A:** Not included
- **2B:** Basic consolidation (25 hrs)
- **2C:** Full infrastructure (35 hrs)
- **Effort:** High complexity, high risk

### Andrew Support
- **2A:** Discovery + basic tools (10 hrs)
- **2B:** Full automation suite (25 hrs)
- **2C:** AI-optimized platform (40 hrs)
- **Effort:** Medium complexity, high value

### Operational Automation
- **2A:** Email only (5 hrs)
- **2B:** Core workflows (20 hrs)
- **2C:** Complete platform (35 hrs)
- **Effort:** Scalable based on workflows automated

### Voice Assistant
- **2A:** Test setup (5 hrs)
- **2B:** Full deployment (15 hrs)
- **2C:** AI-enhanced (25 hrs)
- **Effort:** Low risk, clear boundaries

## 6. Solution-by-Solution Scaling Matrix

| Solution | 2A Effort | 2B Effort | 2C Effort | Cut if Needed? |
|----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|----------------|
| Contact Database | 0 hrs | 25 hrs | 35 hrs | Yes for 2A |
| Andrew Integration | 10 hrs | 25 hrs | 40 hrs | No - Critical |
| Training Videos | 10 hrs | 30 hrs | 60 hrs | Scale down |
| Operations Auto | 5 hrs | 20 hrs | 35 hrs | Scale down |
| Voice Assistant | 5 hrs | 15 hrs | 25 hrs | Yes if needed |
| Remote Consulting | 0 hrs | 10 hrs | 20 hrs | Yes for 2A/2B |
| Enterprise | 0 hrs | 0 hrs | 20 hrs | Yes except 2C |
| Mighty Picks | 0 hrs | 5 hrs | 10 hrs | Always cut |

## Recommendations

### 1. Pricing Adjustment
**Current:** $15k / $28k / $45k
**Recommended:** $20k / $32k / $45k

### 2. Scope Protection
- Require 50% upfront for all packages
- Written change orders for ANY additions
- Weekly scope review calls
- Clear "not included" list upfront

### 3. Delivery Strategy
- Use AI agents for 2A to reduce dev costs
- Tag-team approach for 2B (Matthew mornings, Trent afternoons)
- Full team sprint for 2C

### 4. Risk Mitigation
- 2A: Set extremely clear boundaries, no contact work
- 2B: Start with contact audit, bail if too messy
- 2C: Front-load complex work in first 4 weeks

### 5. Profitability Targets
- 2A: Break even (relationship building)
- 2B: 30% margin minimum
- 2C: 50% margin target

## The Bottom Line

**2A is a loss leader** - Only take it if:
1. They commit to Phase 3 later
2. We can upsell mid-project
3. We use it as pure discovery for larger contract

**2B is our realistic minimum** for profitable delivery

**2C is where we want them** for proper 10x transformation

---

## Next Actions

1. **Revise 2A scope** to be brutally realistic
2. **Create detailed work breakdown** for each package
3. **Set up change order template** before starting
4. **Define "success criteria"** for each deliverable
5. **Plan resource allocation** (who does what, when)

---

## Questions for Team Discussion

1. Should we even offer 2A or start at 2B minimum?
2. Can we use offshore/junior resources for parts?
3. What's our walk-away point?
4. How do we handle Kelsey's inevitable scope creep?
5. Should we require Phase 3 commitment upfront?
