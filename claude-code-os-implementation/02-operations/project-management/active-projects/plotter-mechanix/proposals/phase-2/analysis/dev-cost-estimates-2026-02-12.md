# Developer Cost Estimates: Phase 2 Packages

**Date:** February 12, 2026
**Purpose:** Validate pricing against actual development costs
**Status:** INTERNAL ONLY

---

## Cost Assumptions

### Developer Rates
- **Matthew (Senior):** $150/hr internal cost
- **Trent (Senior):** $150/hr internal cost
- **Junior Developer:** $75/hr internal cost
- **Offshore Developer:** $40/hr internal cost
- **AI Agent "Developer":** $5/hr (API costs only)

### Overhead Factor
- 1.5x for project management, meetings, revisions
- 2x for Kelsey chaos factor (based on history)

---

## Phase 2A: $15,000 Package Analysis

### Original Estimate (Now Unrealistic)
| Component | Raw Hours | w/ Overhead | Cost @ $150/hr |
|-----------|-----------|-------------|----------------|
| Contact Consolidation | 20 | 40 | $6,000 |
| Andrew Integration | 10 | 20 | $3,000 |
| Training Videos | 10 | 20 | $3,000 |
| Basic Automation | 10 | 20 | $3,000 |
| **Total** | **50** | **100** | **$15,000** |

**Problem:** Break-even with zero profit margin

### Revised Realistic 2A
| Component | Raw Hours | w/ Overhead | Developer | Cost |
|-----------|-----------|-------------|-----------|------|
| Andrew Discovery | 3 | 6 | Trent | $900 |
| Basic Tools | 8 | 16 | AI + Junior | $680 |
| 5 Training Videos | 10 | 20 | Junior | $1,500 |
| Email Consolidation | 5 | 10 | AI + Junior | $425 |
| Voice Test | 5 | 10 | Junior | $750 |
| **Total** | **31** | **62** | **Mixed** | **$4,255** |

**Margin:** $15,000 - $4,255 = $10,745 (71% if using junior/AI)

### Recommended 2A Approach
- Use junior developer supervised by Trent (2 hrs/week supervision)
- Heavy AI agent usage for standard automations
- Trent only for Andrew discovery and architecture
- **Profitable but requires different resource model**

## Phase 2B: $28,000 Package Analysis

### Realistic Estimate
| Component | Raw Hours | w/ Overhead | Developer | Cost |
|-----------|-----------|-------------|-----------|------|
| Contact Consolidation | 25 | 50 | Matthew | $7,500 |
| Andrew Full Suite | 20 | 40 | Trent | $6,000 |
| 15 Training Videos | 30 | 45 | Junior | $3,375 |
| Operations Platform | 15 | 30 | Matthew | $4,500 |
| Voice Assistant | 10 | 20 | Junior | $1,500 |
| **Total** | **100** | **185** | **Mixed** | **$22,875** |

**Margin:** $28,000 - $22,875 = $5,125 (18%)

### Risk Factors
- Contact consolidation could blow out to 40+ hours
- Kelsey scope creep highly likely
- **Recommendation:** Needs tight scope control

## Phase 2C: $45,000 Package Analysis

### Comprehensive Estimate
| Component | Raw Hours | w/ Overhead | Developer | Cost |
|-----------|-----------|-------------|-----------|------|
| Full Contact Infrastructure | 35 | 70 | Matthew | $10,500 |
| Andrew AI Platform | 30 | 60 | Trent | $9,000 |
| 30 Training Videos | 60 | 90 | Junior | $6,750 |
| Complete Operations | 25 | 50 | Matthew | $7,500 |
| Advanced Voice | 15 | 30 | Trent | $4,500 |
| Remote Consulting | 10 | 20 | Junior | $1,500 |
| Enterprise Features | 15 | 30 | Matthew | $4,500 |
| **Total** | **190** | **350** | **Mixed** | **$44,250** |

**Margin:** $45,000 - $44,250 = $750 (2%)

**Problem:** No profit at realistic hours!

### Revised 2C Strategy
- Need to increase price to $55,000 OR
- Reduce scope OR
- Use more junior/offshore resources

---

## Resource Allocation Strategy

### Phase 2A ($15k) - Make it Work
**Week 1-2:** Trent (6 hrs) + Junior (20 hrs) + AI
**Week 3-4:** Junior (20 hrs) + AI agents
**Total Cost:** ~$4,500
**Profit:** ~$10,500 (70%)

### Phase 2B ($28k) - Tight but Doable
**Week 1-2:** Matthew (20 hrs) + Trent (15 hrs)
**Week 3-4:** Matthew (20 hrs) + Junior (30 hrs)
**Week 5-6:** Trent (15 hrs) + Junior (20 hrs)
**Total Cost:** ~$18,000
**Profit:** ~$10,000 (36%)

### Phase 2C ($45k) - Need Efficiency
**Use 30% offshore for video/documentation**
**Use AI agents for 20% of development**
**Tag-team senior devs, never both full-time**
**Target Cost:** ~$30,000
**Target Profit:** ~$15,000 (33%)

## Timeline Reality per Solution

### Contact Database Consolidation
- **2B Minimum:** Week 3-4 (25 hrs)
- **2C Full:** Week 2-4 (35 hrs)
- **Critical Path:** Yes - blocks other work
- **Can't Rush:** Data quality issues multiply if rushed

### Andrew Integration
- **2A:** Week 1 discovery, Week 2 basic tools
- **2B:** Week 1-3 progressive buildout
- **2C:** Week 1-4 with AI optimization
- **Critical Path:** Yes - he needs to be productive ASAP

### Training Videos
- **Can Parallel:** Yes - junior dev or offshore
- **Batch Production:** More efficient than spread out
- **2A:** 5 videos = 2 days
- **2B:** 15 videos = 5 days
- **2C:** 30 videos = 10 days

### Operations Automation
- **Dependencies:** Needs contact DB first
- **2A:** Email only - 1 day
- **2B:** Week 4-5 after contacts done
- **2C:** Week 5-7 comprehensive

## Go/No-Go Recommendations

### Phase 2A at $15,000
**GO if:**
- We use junior/AI resources (not senior devs)
- Client accepts minimal scope
- We position as "Phase 2A Lite"
- 50% upfront payment

**NO GO if:**
- They expect senior developers full-time
- They want contact consolidation included
- Kelsey is primary stakeholder (will scope creep)

### Phase 2B at $28,000
**GO if:**
- We can control scope tightly
- Mix of senior/junior resources
- Client signs detailed SOW
- Contact data isn't a disaster

**RISKY - Proceed with caution**

### Phase 2C at $45,000
**NO GO at this price** - Need either:
- Increase to $55,000 OR
- Reduce scope significantly OR
- Use 50% offshore/junior resources

---

## Profitable Package Restructure

### Option 1: Increase All Prices
- 2A: $20,000 (33% increase)
- 2B: $35,000 (25% increase)
- 2C: $55,000 (22% increase)

### Option 2: Reduce Scope
- 2A: Remove training videos
- 2B: Remove voice assistant
- 2C: Remove enterprise features

### Option 3: Change Resource Model
- 2A: 80% junior/AI
- 2B: 60% junior/offshore
- 2C: 50% junior/offshore

### Option 4: Phase Differently
- **Discovery:** $10k (2 weeks)
- **Implementation:** Hourly at $200/hr
- **More profitable and lower risk**

---

## Final Recommendations

1. **Don't take 2A at $15k with current scope**
2. **2B at $28k is breakeven - only if strategic**
3. **2C needs to be $50k minimum**
4. **Consider hourly engagement instead**
5. **Use AI agents aggressively to reduce costs**

---

## Questions for Leadership

1. What's our minimum acceptable margin? (Industry standard: 40-60%)
2. Can we refuse 2A and start at 2B?
3. Should we pivot to hourly/retainer model?
4. How much can we lean on AI agents?
5. Is this client strategic enough to accept low margins?

*Based on historical Kelsey projects, add 50% buffer to all estimates.*
