# Phase 2 Proposal Value Attribution Update
Date: February 12, 2026

## Purpose
Updated the Phase 2 proposal to properly attribute value between Andrew and our AI agency, ensuring we don't overclaim revenue generation but instead position ourselves as enablers and multipliers.

## Key Changes Made

### 1. Fixed Critical Value Attribution (Lines 595-601)
**Before:** Claimed "$1M revenue...pays for Phase 2 in 6 weeks"
**After:** Clarified Andrew's baseline capability vs. our 5x multiplier effect

### 2. Added "Understanding Value Creation" Section (Lines 603-623)
- Separated Andrew's inherent value (expertise, relationships, execution)
- Clarified our AI infrastructure contribution (automation, scale, efficiency)
- Emphasized the partnership synergy

### 3. Updated Section Titles
- Changed "Why Andrew + Your Contacts = Immediate Gold" → "How AI Infrastructure Multiplies Andrew's Expertise"

### 4. Fixed ROI Table (Line 458)
**Before:** "$400,000-$750,000" (implied we generate)
**After:** "Enables Andrew to capture $400K-$750K (multiplies his baseline 3-5x)"

### 5. Reframed ROI Section (Lines 461-467)
- Renamed to "The Partnership ROI: Andrew + AI Infrastructure"
- Added baseline value acknowledgment
- Clarified we remove friction, not generate revenue

### 6. Updated Phase 2 Outcomes (Lines 720-723)
- Changed passive voice to active voice
- Showed Andrew driving supplies with our infrastructure support
- Clarified systems "support" not "generate" revenue

## Key Messages Now Embedded

1. **Andrew's Inherent Value:** His expertise would generate $200-300K annually even without technology
2. **Our Multiplier Effect:** We enable 5x reach amplification through automation
3. **Partnership Synergy:** Neither component alone achieves full potential
4. **Proper Attribution:** Andrew executes; we enable and optimize
5. **Risk Mitigation:** Our systems prevent burnout while scaling

## Verification Completed
✓ No "$2M" claims remaining
✓ No "we generate" language
✓ Active voice showing proper attribution
✓ Baseline vs. multiplier clearly separated
✓ Partnership value properly framed

## Result
The proposal now properly respects Andrew's expertise as the primary value driver while positioning our agency as the technology partner that multiplies his effectiveness. This honest attribution builds trust and sets realistic expectations for the partnership.
