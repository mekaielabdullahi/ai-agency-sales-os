# The 6-Week Liberation Timeline

**Phase 2: Scale Without the Chaos**

*Plotter Mechanix*

---

## The Promise

> **In 6 weeks, we give Alyssa back 20 hours per week and eliminate the "confused hours" that cost Kelsey $91,000/year in lost productivity—so Plotter Mechanix can scale from 15 to 45+ weekly calls without adding headcount.**

Every milestone exists to make this true. Every deliverable is measured against it.

---

## The Math (Before We Go Further)

| Current State | After Phase 2 |
|---------------|---------------|
| Alyssa: 25-30 hrs/week on email, quotes, coordination | **20+ hours recovered** |
| Kelsey: 30 "confused hours" per week | **10+ hours back to revenue work** |
| Contacts: 15,000 scattered across 4 systems | **One source of truth (Jobber)** |
| Quote process: 15 min each | **5 min each (66% faster)** |

**ROI in plain English:**
- Alyssa's recovered time @ $30/hr = **$31,200/year**
- Kelsey's recovered time @ $175/hr = **$91,000/year**
- Combined annual value: **$122,200** (conservative)
- Phase 2 investment: **$28,000**
- **Payback: ~67 days**

*Even if we only hit 50% of targets, you're still profitable in under 6 months.*

## What's Holding You Back Right Now

### 1. Contact Data Lives in 4 Different Places

> *"I've got Jobber, I have this thing called Capsule, which is my old CRM... it synchronizes to QuickBooks, and QuickBooks synchronizes to Jobber. So there's some sort of a thing going on there... but that doesn't have anything to do with my Outlook."*

> *"My cell phone contacts, there's like 15,000 in there, and I can't keep track of it."*

**The Reality:** Capsule, Jobber, QuickBooks, and Outlook all have different versions of the same customers. Constant duplicates. Mismatched phone numbers. 15,000+ contacts scattered across systems with no single source of truth.

### 2. Second Calls Disappear Into Notes

> *"The second phone call I make to them or they call me back again... nobody else knows what's happening. It just disappears."*

> *"Well, that just went right into the notes of the existing job. And nobody would have known anything about it if I didn't call Alyssa and tell her, hey, I need you to make a separate job."*

**The Reality:** Quo captures the first call perfectly, but follow-up calls merge into existing job notes. New opportunities get buried. Without Kelsey manually flagging them, they vanish.

### 3. You're Looking for Mary, But His Name Is Jim

> *"When Mary calls, I'm looking through my call log for Mary, but his name is Jim and it's a different company."*

> *"My Outlook is all messed up from just 15 years of just not knowing what's going on."*

**The Reality:** Contact records are stale. People leave companies, numbers change, but the data doesn't. You're searching for customers by names that no longer match reality.

### 4. Working 70 Hours, But Confused for 30

> *"I think we're at 70 hours or whatever a week... I mean, I'm basically working 40 hours a week. But I'm confused for the other 30."*

> *"A lot of days I spend just rocking around in circles trying to figure out what I'm supposed to do... I get confused in the morning when I get bombarded with a whole bunch of stuff."*

**The Reality:** Half your working hours are spent managing chaos instead of generating revenue. The morning bombardment creates constant context-switching. Every interruption costs you focus.

## The 6-Week Transformation

Three paid milestones. One included bonus. Each with clear success criteria.

---

### Milestone 1: Foundation (Weeks 1-2) — $10,000

**What We're Building:**
- Complete workflow analysis with Alyssa and Kelsey
- Map how data flows between Quo, Jobber, QuickBooks, and Capsule
- Design the central request inbox architecture
- Plan contact database unification strategy

**Specific Deliverables:**

| Deliverable | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| **Workflow Documentation** | Alyssa's daily task breakdown: minute-by-minute map of where time goes |
| **Data Flow Diagram** | Visual map showing Quo → Jobber → QuickBooks → Capsule connections and gaps |
| **Contact Audit Report** | Duplicate count across all 4 systems, merge strategy, data quality score |
| **Technical Spec Document** | 5-10 page blueprint: system architecture, API connections, automation rules |
| **Week 1-2 Demo Session** | 60-minute walkthrough of findings with Kelsey and Alyssa |

**Success Looks Like:** Technical spec approved, baseline metrics documented (Alyssa's current hours on email, quote processing time, contact lookup time). This becomes the measuring stick for everything else.

---

### Milestone 2: Core Systems (Weeks 3-4) — $10,000

**What We're Building:**
- Central Request Inbox: All emails, texts, website leads flow into one place for Alyssa to triage
- Quote Speed Up: Streamlined Quo→Jobber workflow with smart shortcuts and deposit notifications
- Contact Sync: Jobber becomes the single source of truth, syncing to QuickBooks
- Knowledge Base: AI-powered search across all your manuals and documentation

**Specific Deliverables:**

| Deliverable | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| **Central Request Inbox** | Make.com/n8n automation deployed - all channels (email, SMS, website leads) feeding one dashboard |
| **Quote Workflow Automation** | Quo→Jobber process reduced from 15 min → 5 min per quote (66% time savings) |
| **Second-Call Job Creation** | Automated detection: when a follow-up call is a NEW opportunity, prompts Alyssa to create separate job |
| **Contact Sync Engine** | Jobber as master database, bi-directional sync to QuickBooks, duplicate merge rules active |
| **Sona AI Knowledge Base** | 50+ indexed documents (manuals, SOPs, troubleshooting guides) searchable by voice or text |
| **Staging Environment Access** | Test all systems before go-live - click around, break things, give feedback |

**Success Looks Like:** Quote processing time drops to 5 minutes or less (verified by Alyssa). All 4 contact systems syncing without manual intervention. Knowledge base answers 80%+ of common questions without Kelsey.

---

### Milestone 3: Go Live (Weeks 5-6) — $8,000

**What We're Building:**
- Enhanced Request Form: Smart form that captures complete customer info upfront
- Production deployment: All systems connected to live Jobber and Quo
- Team training: Hands-on sessions with Alyssa on new workflows
- WhatsApp knowledge group: Team communication hub for sharing tips

**Specific Deliverables:**

| Deliverable | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| **Smart Request Form** | Embedded on website, auto-routes to correct team member based on request type |
| **Production Systems Live** | All automations connected to real Jobber, Quo, QuickBooks data |
| **Training Video Library** | 15 videos covering specific workflows |
| **WhatsApp Knowledge Group** | Setup complete, initial content seeded, team onboarded |
| **30-Day Support Package** | Response within 4 business hours, up to 10 hours of adjustments included |
| **Operations Runbook** | Written procedures for Alyssa covering all new systems |

**Success Looks Like:** Alyssa's tracked inbox/coordination time drops by at least 60% within 30 days of launch (measured against Milestone 1 baseline). Kelsey can be absent for 3 days without constant phone interruptions.

---

### Included: SOPs & Ongoing Training (Normally $10,000)

At no additional cost, you also receive:

- **15 Training Videos** covering every workflow
- **Operations Runbook** for Alyssa
- **WhatsApp Knowledge Group** for team communication
- **30-Day Post-Launch Support** (up to 10 hours of adjustments)

This is normally a separate $10,000 package. It's included because we want these systems to stick—not just launch.

---

## The Guarantee

> **If we don't hit at least a 50% reduction in Alyssa's email/coordination time within 60 days of go-live (measured against your Milestone 1 baseline), we'll work up to 60 additional days at no extra cost until we do.**

You've already seen the Phase 1 results. We're not asking you to take a leap of faith—we're asking you to let us prove it again.
