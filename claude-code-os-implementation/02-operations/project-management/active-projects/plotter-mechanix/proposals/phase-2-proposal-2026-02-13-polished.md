# The 6-Week Liberation Timeline

**Phase 2: Scale Without the Chaos**

*Plotter Mechanix*

---

## The Business Transformation

Phase 2 enables a dual expansion: Kelsey scales the service business while Andrew launches the vinyl printing supply chain. The systems we build support both simultaneously.

### The Partnership Structure

**Kelsey's Domain:** Service operations—from 15 to 45+ weekly calls, enabled by automation that frees you from firefighting

**Andrew's Domain:** Supply chain & vinyl printing—$5K PPG investment (10-year warranty product), upstream/downstream fulfillment, 5% revenue share model

**The Foundation:** Automated systems that eliminate bottlenecks and create capacity for both growth paths

## What's Holding You Back Right Now

### 1. Contact Data Lives in 4 Different Places

> *"I've got Jobber, I have this thing called Capsule, which is my old CRM... it synchronizes to QuickBooks, and QuickBooks synchronizes to Jobber. So there's some sort of a thing going on there... but that doesn't have anything to do with my Outlook."*

> *"My cell phone contacts, there's like 15,000 in there, and I can't keep track of it."*

**The Reality:** Capsule, Jobber, QuickBooks, and Outlook all have different versions of the same customers. Constant duplicates. Mismatched phone numbers. 15,000+ contacts scattered across systems with no single source of truth.

### 2. Second Calls Disappear Into Notes

> *"The second phone call I make to them or they call me back again... nobody else knows what's happening. It just disappears."*

> *"Well, that just went right into the notes of the existing job. And nobody would have known anything about it if I didn't call Alyssa and tell her, hey, I need you to make a separate job."*

**The Reality:** Quo captures the first call perfectly, but follow-up calls merge into existing job notes. New opportunities get buried. Without Kelsey manually flagging them, they vanish.

### 3. You're Looking for Mary, But His Name Is Jim

> *"When Mary calls, I'm looking through my call log for Mary, but his name is Jim and it's a different company."*

> *"My Outlook is all messed up from just 15 years of just not knowing what's going on."*

**The Reality:** Contact records are stale. People leave companies, numbers change, but the data doesn't. You're searching for customers by names that no longer match reality.

### 4. Working 70 Hours, But Confused for 30

> *"I think we're at 70 hours or whatever a week... I mean, I'm basically working 40 hours a week. But I'm confused for the other 30."*

> *"A lot of days I spend just rocking around in circles trying to figure out what I'm supposed to do... I get confused in the morning when I get bombarded with a whole bunch of stuff."*

**The Reality:** Half your working hours are spent managing chaos instead of generating revenue. The morning bombardment creates constant context-switching. Every interruption costs you focus.

## What This Gets You: ROI Analysis

### Time Savings Breakdown (Complete Option)

| Who | Hours Saved/Week | Rate | Annual Value | Assumptions |
|-----|-----------------|------|--------------|-------------|
| **Alyssa** | 20 hrs | $30/hr | **$31,200** | Quote processing (8 hrs), inbox management (6 hrs), contact lookups (4 hrs), coordination (2 hrs) |
| **Kelsey** | 10 hrs | $175/hr | **$91,000** | Based on billable rate; includes time answering repeat questions, managing chaos, morning coordination |

**Kelsey's 30 Confused Hours → 30 Productive Hours:**
- Conservative estimate: Recover 10 hrs/week (33% of confused time)
- At service rate ($175/hr): $91,000/year
- At opportunity cost (consulting at $375/hr): $195,000/year potential

### Revenue Opportunity

| Source | Annual Value | How We Calculated |
|--------|--------------|-------------------|
| **More service calls possible** | $58,240 | 10 additional calls/week × $112 average × 52 weeks |
| **Andrew's vinyl infrastructure** | $15,000 | Systems to support supplies launch (conservative) |
| **Fewer mistakes** | $12,000 | Duplicate jobs, wrong contacts, missed quotes (industry average 2-3% error cost) |

### Total Value Summary

| Scenario | Time Savings | Revenue Gains | Total Annual Value |
|----------|--------------|---------------|-------------------|
| **Conservative** | $92,200 | $60,000 | **$152,200** |
| **Expected (Complete)** | $122,200 | $85,240 | **$207,440** |
| **Optimistic** | $152,200 | $120,000 | **$272,200** |

### ROI Metrics (Complete Option - $28,000 Investment)

| Metric | Conservative | Expected | Optimistic |
|--------|--------------|----------|------------|
| **ROI** | 444% | **641%** | 872% |
| **Payback Period** | 67 days | **49 days** | 37 days |
| **3-Year Value** | $456,600 | $622,320 | $816,600 |

**The Bottom Line:** Even the conservative scenario pays back in under 3 months. The expected case? Investment returns in 49 days.

### The Partnership Multiplier

Andrew's $250K annual baseline value × 5x technology multiplier = $1.25M partnership potential. These systems enable both service scaling AND vinyl supply chain launch simultaneously.
