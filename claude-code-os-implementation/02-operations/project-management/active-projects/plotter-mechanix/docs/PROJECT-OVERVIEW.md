## Automation Description

**Business:** Printer service & repair company (Phoenix metro)
**Annual Revenue:** $600K-$750K
**Team:** 3 people + Technical Consultant
- Kelce (owner/only tech) - does ALL technical work
- Alyssa (office manager) - scheduling, invoicing, supply orders
- Joe (trainee) - learning field work, social media
- Mike (consultant) - systems engineering, robotics, cloud infrastructure

**Business Models:**
1. Service calls: $250/call (primary revenue)
2. Remote consulting: $175/session (growth opportunity)
3. **Hardware rental:** $300-450/mo + usage fees at 60% margins (NEW MODEL)
4. E-commerce: Product sales + drop shipping (expansion)

**CRITICAL PROBLEM:** "If I don't come to work, we make no money. Business would shut down in a couple months." - Kelce

**#1 Priority:** Clone Kelce's capabilities
- Kelce is sole technical person - can't delegate 90% of work
- Training Joe but he can't handle most calls yet
- Lost $10K last year to inefficiencies (1.3-1.6% of revenue)
- 2 hrs/day commuting, stuck in traffic
- Phone blowing up, manual communication chaos
- **Kelce's effective rate: $300-375/hour** (time savings = direct revenue)

**CRITICAL CONSTRAINT:** January 1, 2025 - QuickBooks reset
- $700K reconciliation error being fixed
- Fresh financial start date
- Any integration must align with new QB setup

**Core Pain Points:**
1. **Zero Delegation:** Business dies if Kelce is sick/absent
2. **Data Silos:** Jobber, QuickBooks, Shopify, Capsule (legacy) don't talk
3. **No Inventory:** "I have no fucking clue what I have in stock"
4. **Manual Everything:** Alyssa writes notes on paper → transcribes to Jobber
5. **Communication Chaos:** 4-5 different text/messaging systems

**Magic Wand Solutions (From Client):**
1. Training system to clone Kelce (video library, SOPs, step-by-step guides)
2. Unified communication hub (all systems talking)
3. Inventory management (see stock instantly, unlock capital for eBay sales)
4. Voice-to-text automation (reduce Alyssa's manual work)

**Opportunity:** Remote consulting expansion
- Kelce wants to move to Piantop, work remotely
- Already doing remote support ($175/call) - "could do this all day long"
- Keep local service running with Joe + future hires

## Dependencies
- [x] Drive folder access (DONE 2025-12-08)
- [x] Discovery call completed (DONE Dec 2-3)
- [x] Transcripts processed & analyzed (DONE Dec 8)
- [ ] Malik's previous work retrieved (need Kelce to contact wife Nikki)
- [ ] Budget range discussion (need follow-up call)
- [ ] API access to client systems (Jobber, QuickBooks, Shopify)

## Blockers
- **Budget Unknown:** Need explicit budget range before accurate pricing
- **Malik's Work:** $7K previous project data needed to avoid redo (waiting on Kelce)

## Risks
- **Chris Relationship Risk:** This is first project - must execute flawlessly to secure future pipeline
- **Change Fatigue Risk:** Burned by Malik's $7K failed project - needs to SEE results, not promises
- **Time Availability Risk:** Kelce bills by hour - limited time for implementation
- **Scope Creep Risk:** Kelce has BIG vision (remote business, training platform) - must focus on foundation first
- **People Dependency Risk:** Alyssa memory issues, Joe training timeline, Kelce burnout - solution must reduce dependency
