## Meeting Purpose

Stakeholder interview to understand Nicole's role, workflows, and pain points.

---

## Key Takeaways

- Nicole's 25-30 hr/wk role is a temporary stopgap; her goal is to delegate bookkeeping to a professional firm (~$300/mo) to free her time for law school.
- Kelsey is overwhelmed as the sole technical expert, working in the business instead of on it. The primary goal is to free his time for high-leverage growth activities (networking, sales).
- A key strategy is to monetize Kelsey's knowledge by creating a video library of repairs. This would generate passive revenue and enable a nationwide, remote business model.
- Jobber and QuickBooks have critical sync failures (e.g., unapplied deposits) that require manual workarounds, creating financial reconciliation risks.

## Topics

### The Problem: Overwhelmed Founder & Bottlenecked Operations

- Kelsey is the sole technical expert, creating a single point of failure and bottleneck for all technical work.
- This forces him to work in the business as a technician, preventing him from focusing on high-leverage growth activities like networking and sales.
- The business is currently reactive, struggling to keep up with service calls instead of proactively seeking growth.

### The Solution: Monetize Knowledge & Delegate Operations

- **Vision:** Transition Kelsey from a field technician to a business owner who can work remotely (e.g., from Pinetop).
- **Core Strategy:** Monetize Kelsey's deep technical knowledge by creating a video library of common repairs.
  - **Monetization Model:** Customers pay ~$99 for a repair video and can purchase parts directly from the company, generating passive revenue.
  - **Market Expansion:** This model allows the business to serve a nationwide audience, moving beyond its current Arizona-only service area.
- **Operational Support:**
  - **Delegation:** Nicole acts as a "middleman," translating Kelsey's high-level needs into actionable tasks for Alyssa and Joe.
  - **Tech Training:** The company plans to train new technicians in-house (like Joe) to ensure quality and fit, as finding qualified external talent is difficult.

### The Blocker: Bookkeeping & System Inefficiencies

- **Nicole's Role:** Manages all bookkeeping, payroll, and collections (25-30 hrs/wk).
- **Primary Pain Point:** This role is a temporary stopgap. Nicole's goal is to delegate it to a professional firm to focus on law school.
  - **Cost:** ~$300/month for basic bookkeeping.
  - **Rationale:** A previous hire stole money, making a professional firm a more trusted and secure solution.
- **Jobber & QuickBooks Sync Issues:**
  - **Unapplied Deposits:** Deposits paid in Jobber do not automatically apply to the corresponding invoice in QuickBooks, requiring manual correction.
  - **Account Allocation:** Jobber cannot direct funds to specific bank accounts (e.g., operating, credit card), forcing manual allocation in QuickBooks.
- **QuickBooks History:** The current file is a "mess" from 5 years of learning and inconsistent labeling. A fresh start is needed, as QuickBooks doesn't allow deleting old data.
