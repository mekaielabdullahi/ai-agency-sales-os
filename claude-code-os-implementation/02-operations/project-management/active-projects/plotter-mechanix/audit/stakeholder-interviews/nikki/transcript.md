0:00 - Chris Andrade
No, it just says, so it gives me a start watching. Matthew, she's having issues with her camera.

0:07 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
So sometimes I always have issues with my microphone. There's no mute button. And what I do is just leave and come back and rejoin it and then it works. maybe you can try that. Do you want to try that, Nicole?

0:18 - Chris Andrade
Yeah, I'll try that. Okay. You've been calling her Nikki the whole time and her name's been Nicole. People call her Nikki, right?

0:28 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Or is she called?

0:29 - Chris Andrade
Yeah, we'll ask her because I would like to clarify, if I'm being honest. Yeah.

0:37 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Good, good shout out.

0:42 - Chris Andrade
That's like one of the big things in hotels is like greeting them by the name. Yeah.

0:50 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Yep. That's Oh, yeah.

0:59 - Mekaiel Abdullahi
You're welcome. Thank you. There you go. There we go. Thank you, Matthew, coming in for the win.

1:07 - Chris Andrade
Yeah. Let's turn it off and back on again. There we go. Oh, look at that. Where are you at? That's some cool. You got some wall planters hanging up. Look at you. This is my little home office. Man. So I'm a garden guy and I actually been wanting to do walled gardens and stuff like for a minute.

1:32 - Mekaiel Abdullahi
These aren't real.

1:33 - Chris Andrade
These are fake. Well, they look real and that's all that matters. So kudos.

1:38 - Mekaiel Abdullahi
All right, gentlemen, what are we doing today?

1:41 - Nicole Howard
Well, we just want to thank you for your time.

1:44 - Mekaiel Abdullahi
Our goal today is to do a stakeholder interview. And the goal of that is just to kind of get an inside out view of the business. So we're going to be doing this with everyone. You're our first person we're interviewing. So lucky you. So we're just going to ask some questions. you. Try to get as detailed as possible. And we have a plan for an hour. Hopefully we don't go over, but if we need to, we can. So we'll just get started. If you don't have any questions for us. I'm ready to go. Okay, awesome. So can you just walk me through your typical day? And how does it look like?

2:25 - Nicole Howard
So basically, I handle all the bookkeeping, payroll checks, emails. My main job is to just try to keep the bills paid and accounting and going. I assist Kelsey with anything that he needs. Hey, can you call this person? Hey, can you tell Alyssa to order this part? Can you check on this part? Where is this part? Locate it. I need it for my next job. But my main job is handling the bills and accounting side of everything.

3:08 - Mekaiel Abdullahi
And I'm assuming that's full-time, doing that 40 hours on top of everything else that you just mentioned. I wouldn't say it's a 40-hour job, no.

3:18 - Nicole Howard
I probably can spend 25 to 30 hours a week doing it. Is that just for water mechanics?

3:29 - Mekaiel Abdullahi
Yes. No, think total, not just total, right?

3:37 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
I'm sorry?

3:38 - Nicole Howard
It's not just bookkeeping that's 25 to 30 hours.

3:41 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
It's total everything that you just discussed.

3:43 - Nicole Howard
Yeah, I would say 25, 30 hours a week.

3:45 - Chris Andrade
How much time do you think bookkeeping takes out of that?

3:51 - Mekaiel Abdullahi
Majority of it.

3:52 - Nicole Howard
I delegate tasks more than I handle those on my end. So if Kelsey needs something, I'll say, Alyssa, can you do this? Joe, can you do that? You're at, wave And I have that.

4:02 - Mekaiel Abdullahi
I'll source those tasks. Nice. Okay. Do you take client calls at all? I do.

4:09 - Nicole Howard
Mainly accounting calls. If there's a problem with a check, someone has a question about an invoice. I do a lot of outbound calls. So a lot of my job is collecting. I call the customer. Hey, we haven't received your payment. This invoice is open for 60 days. Can you just give me an update? Can you make a payment today? So I spend a lot of my time trying to collect payments, customer calls. And I'm assuming you get that through Jobber?

4:41 - Mekaiel Abdullahi
Is that mostly through Jobber? Yeah.

4:46 - Nicole Howard
So all the invoices are recorded open in Jobber and as well as it's transfer. So I just go to my open invoices. I start with the latest past due. Like right now I have some open invoices from May and I'm just. know what might I've been able to collect on them. It's the new year. I'm just going to have to write it off as bad debt and just don't do business with that customer anymore.

5:09 - Mekaiel Abdullahi
And I know you mentioned a lot of your triggers are when Kelsey asks you to do a certain task or to delegate a certain task. Chris, do you want to say something first? Yeah, I just wanted to touch a question on that real quick.

5:25 - Chris Andrade
Actually, just keep going. Let me let me think about how I want to work. Yeah, keep going. Sorry. All right.

5:30 - Mekaiel Abdullahi
So you said a lot of your triggers are when Kelsey asks you to do certain tasks. Trigger. I don't think I said trigger.

5:38 - Nicole Howard
I don't understand.

5:39 - Mekaiel Abdullahi
No, as in like you said you delegate a lot. Yeah, so I won't specifically do the task.

5:46 - Nicole Howard
I just try to help facilitate an easy break between Kelsey. Kelsey gets frustrated sometimes and it's easier for him to be like, I can't get this done. I can't get this done. And then I go to him and I say, OK, how can I help you? Well, I need this, this and this done. And then I go to them and I say. Hey guys, can you do this, this, and this. So I'm just kind of like a middleman so that I just kind of help facilitate things. Awesome.

6:08 - Mekaiel Abdullahi
Anything, Matthew, Chris, anything on day-to-day workflow? Yeah.

6:13 - Chris Andrade
I mean, your customers don't pay the bills and now you have to write that off. How do you keep track of those customers and like, what does that look like on your end?

6:25 - Nicole Howard
So there are specific customers in the title of their name. So like, print, sign, shop. Let's just say that's the customer. If it says COD right next to their name, it means it's very hard to collect money from them and they do COD. They need to give us cash on demand and delivery on point. We also have DNDB right next to their name, which is do not do business. We will not work with this customer anymore.

6:55 - Mekaiel Abdullahi
And is there another category for like a good customer?

6:59 - Chris Andrade
No. No. That's just their name. Okay, so if they don't have a tag, you said D&D or don't do business or cash on demand? D do not do business, and then COD, cash on delivery, cash on demand.

7:15 - Nicole Howard
So those are the only two categories that clients fall under right now? Actually, we do also have a star next to their name. If there's a star next to their name, they're a good customer. Net 30 terms is generally acceptable. They can come pick up ink and supplies and whatever they need, and we know that they're going to pay their bill. And how reliable has that system been?

7:36 - Chris Andrade
Have you had any issues with that reliability of that category section? I don't think so, because it's pretty simple.

7:44 - Nicole Howard
There's three categories, good net 30 terms, do not do business, and they have to pay us cash up front.

7:51 - Chris Andrade
I guess what I mean by missed opportunities is like, did you guys do business with somebody that should have been marked as Do not do business or accepted debt 30 when you should have gotten cash? Has that happened at all?

8:07 - Nicole Howard
Yeah, I think that's kind of why we came up with the system. So it would help each person who's looking at the customer, writing the invoice to identify good ones versus bad ones. Kelsey's a helper of all people. So even if it says do not do business, he'll still take the call. He'll still try to help the customer. He'll still try to do something billable, but I'm like, okay, well, I'm not getting paid for this and don't expect it. So he's just doing it out of the kindness of his heart.

8:36 - Chris Andrade
I'm sorry. Yeah, when he gets that phone call from that customer, does he know that that customer is labeled?

8:44 - Mekaiel Abdullahi
He won't see it on his phone, but he knows the customers. He knows them inside and out.

8:47 - Nicole Howard
He knows who's going to pay and who's not.

8:50 - Chris Andrade
So maybe if there was a way, like if we saw like, oh, this COD's customer's calling me and he's asking me for all these things, you know? Yeah, okay, perfect.

9:03 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
I had a question around the delegation stuff that you do. So when Kelsey tells you, does he give you explicit instructions, like I need this person to do this? Or is there any level of like, he just needs something done and you kind of figure out what needs to get what like who should get delegated to?

9:25 - Nicole Howard
Yeah, so he will get overwhelmed and he doesn't know how to communicate clearly. I know how to decipher what he needs and then transfer it to the other two people we work with and get the job done for him. Like, I don't know how to explain that properly, but just decipher because he can go, I'm like, okay, step one, like, let's break it down.

9:51 - Chris Andrade
Let's get it done.

9:54 - Mekaiel Abdullahi
That's awesome. So it's just expand on that. So it's more... If him giving you a problem or issue that needs to be solved, and then you're breaking that down and delegating it to whoever it needs to go to that. Is that correct? Yes. Okay. Awesome. Anything else on day to day, guys?

10:16 - Chris Andrade
No, are you going to go to number number six? Yeah.

10:21 - Mekaiel Abdullahi
So next I want to get into like some pain points on like what frustrates you about the day to day business? Like any big time sinks or bottlenecks? And I'm just trying to just see like generalize, see what what your day to day frustrations are. Um, my job is pretty bland.

10:44 - Nicole Howard
Um, I guess it's just like accounting. So I have to go through, I have to make my expenses, my matches, my deposits, all the numbers need to what have. Bye. Bye. Bye. Equal each other. Um, but it's not a pain point. It's just a tedious task, uh, and quite monotonous, but other than that, it's, it's, it's pretty, uh, simplistic and normal.

11:14 - Mekaiel Abdullahi
Got it. And I was referring to maybe more of like the communication between you and Kelsey and how that, like, are there pain points in like how he's giving you the information that like whatever problems there are. Um, I know you said you're doing most of like figuring it out and delegating, but it, I was just trying to get an understanding of the style of communication on how, like whatever he needs done, how does he disseminate that to his team and you guys?

11:43 - Nicole Howard
Um, I guess it's just Kelsey's communication style. He doesn't expect, he's just overwhelmed. So like he will be doing something physically with his hands that takes all of his attention and focus. And yet he's answering the call, trying to solve someone else's problem. Trying to help somebody over here. I'm calling them because I need this. And then it's just like overload. And then he has to, like, get it out. He's like, Nikki, I need help with this person. This customer is calling me. I'm still trying to fix this belt on this printer right now. So he, that's just the way when that happened, we're a married couple and we're, we live together. We work together. We eat, we breathe, we do everything together. So we're, we're really used to each other. And so maybe our communication skills are like, you know, like, probably not like a boss employee kind.

12:35 - Mekaiel Abdullahi
It's kind of like, Hey, you know, um, but how does, how does him being overwhelmed to show up, um, like with your job, you know, cause I'm sure that kind of takes away from your, your priorities, you know? Um, so I just want to kind of like connect that. Like, I don't really, it doesn't really affect me.

12:58 - Nicole Howard
I just, I'm always on the. So my job can get done. What he needs is immediate. So he needs a part. He needs to know where it is. His customers want this.

13:08 - Mekaiel Abdullahi
What he needs is immediate. I can match and do my expenses later.

13:13 - Nicole Howard
That's not an immediate need. Unless when it comes to tax time, when I have to sit down and do all that, my needs are not immediate. So it's always make Kelsey priority and whatever he needs.

13:27 - Mekaiel Abdullahi
What information from Kelsey, like on the day to day stuff, do you wish you had that you don't have right now? As in like, are there times where he communicates something to you and it gets lost through the cracks or are there any communication gaps between how the team communicates or you communicate with Kelsey when it comes to the business? Uh yeah, I mean like it's just, to me, it's just something that's normal. Um Okay. You You

14:00 - Nicole Howard
Kelsey has something in his head, and then if it's not communicated properly to the right people, and then maybe that person didn't write it down, or they forgot, or, and then he's like, wait a minute, we talked about this, so there's communication gaps in between there, and getting whatever he needs to the right person, and then holding that person accountable for providing that information. But I think for the most part, it goes over pretty smoothly. I mean, we're humans, so we don't do everything perfectly all the time, and I'm more malleable to those situations where Kelsey's probably not.

14:43 - Mekaiel Abdullahi
Yeah, our goal is kind of like, on the outside looking in is for anyone to be able to, and not you guys just be the bottleneck, right? So it's, our goal is to kind of understand the process and how the communication happens, in order to disseminate that to everyone that it needs to go to. So we're just trying to get an understanding. of the day-to-day in the workflow. So that way, anyone could come in, anyone new could come in your role or whoever's role, and they could have a standardized process in how things are supposed to work, and a communication protocol for all of those channels, you know? So that's kind of our goal with this interview is to kind of understand everyone's piece of things and then put it together as a whole to make it easier for you guys to do your job, essentially, you know? I also just understand, like, so it seems kind of like it's fun.

15:28 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Like, it seems like there's a bit of fun in the chaos a little bit with, like, Kelsey's doing all this stuff, and then he needs, he needs this part, he needs this thing, and then, Nikki, you're there, and you're, like, able to just be, like, I don't know if my video's kind of cutting out, but you're, like, able to help him just kind of, like, get that thing that he needs right away, right? And then that's a big part of the current workflow, like, the way things are going, and it seems like it's kind of fun. Like, it seems like you're enjoying that, and I think Kelsey probably is, too. I think that Kelsey's more overwhelmed than enjoying. Okay. And I'm just, I wouldn't call it, yay.

16:16 - Nicole Howard
I'm not like, it's just, it's just, it just is. Yeah. This is what's happening.

16:23 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Okay. Got it. Okay.

16:26 - Mekaiel Abdullahi
So how much, um, how much time do you think I Kelsey's spending on things that he doesn't have to be spending them on like monotonous things, right? Like, Hey, do this, do that. Or like, like things that don't require his time or attention because our goal is to kind of free up his time. Right. So could you give me some examples of things that he does today that he doesn't necessarily need to be the one doing?

16:49 - Nicole Howard
Um, that's kind of difficult because without him, nothing would get done. Um, he, no, he just has all that information into his brain. So he has to be the one to tell us what he needs. I can't look at a plotter and say it needs this, this, and this. You know, all that information's inside his head. I think that what I would really like him to be is not a technician in the field and see him more like running and managing his business and talking to customers and going out and getting customers. So I would really like to see him being the owner of a business versus working in the business.

17:37 - Chris Andrade
Real quick, have you guys had experience with bringing onboard technicians and how did that go and what did that look like?

17:47 - Nicole Howard
Okay, so right now Joe is, he's doing really well. He's been with us for a couple of months now, not very long. I would say since October-ish.

18:01 - Chris Andrade
But he's doing really well.

18:03 - Nicole Howard
He's learning very quickly, but it's not like you can just go on Indeed and be like, I need a plotter technician. They're not out there. And if they are, they already work for another company. It's not like there's a high supply and demand for plotter technicians. It's a very unique niche field. So in the past, we haven't, we had a technician and we've had a couple of technicians, but ultimately they just didn't work out. Can you, can you give me like a little reasons why?

18:36 - Chris Andrade
Was it because the technicians just were overwhelmed or what was it you think?

18:43 - Nicole Howard
I think that being a technician, you really have to be a self-starter and self-motivated person. So like you have to get up early. have to see your jobs. You have to know, you have to go to this job first, then that job, then this job, then this job. Don't forget your parts for each of the jobs. I'm like... It's a very, you have to be on your game kind of situation. No one's going to sit there and babysit you and walk you through this. And it's like one of our technicians one time would be like, go to North Phoenix, go to South Phoenix, then go to back to North all in one day. was like, well, there's got to be some sort of like common sense there. Like, do your jobs in the North first. Oh, I forgot a part, drive back to the office, go get the part. It's like, okay, you know, so it's, it's, you've got got to be kind of a little bit. One thing I was like, common sense isn't so common.

19:36 - Mekaiel Abdullahi
And sometimes having things laid out and like a protocol or like a, hey, this is how we expect you to do things just makes it so much easier. You'd be surprised. We see it all the time. I'm sure you guys do too, but 100%. Just to circle back on things that Kelsey do. Sorry. I'm sorry. Go ahead, Chris. Okay.

19:57 - Chris Andrade
Um, when you are. So, in your opinion, is it easier to find, like for me in construction, right? It's hard to find the talent, especially if the pool is so small. So, what I have found is I love the idea of bringing somebody on as like a dishwasher, making them understand the business inside, and then giving them an evaluation that's more expedited, maybe like instead of a three-month, they're on a three-week, right? Because you see potential in that individual, and you want to encourage them to be a part of my company and our brand and represent and encourage them. So, if we, if there was a way to develop something like that, and actually, like Joe, starting kind of from the bottom, he does have experience, but then we're So we working them up to a Kelsey, right? Does that seem like something that would be beneficial to you, like a good plan of a tech, because it's so hard to find quality technicians?

21:11 - Nicole Howard
So if I understand what you're saying, you're saying basically train somebody versus finding someone that's already trained. Yeah. Yeah, so that would be a Joe right now. And that's a really good thing to have, is training somebody because you train them the way you want them to learn. And that's definitely worked out in the past the best for us. But people are, I find it difficult to have somebody that's committed to a business long term, you know, people move jobs, switch jobs, change their minds, you know, it's not like men grow up one day and are like, I want to be a plotter technician, you know, like, it's just, it's just what yeah So I'm just hoping, you know, Joe sticks around for a while. Go ahead. I can't hear you. You're on mute, Chris.

22:09 - Mekaiel Abdullahi
Doesn't help. I said the biggest asset to any company is its people, right?

22:14 - Chris Andrade
No matter how much money you can buy the best equipment, if you don't have the good people at the end of the day, it kind of falls on deaf ears. So I think it's a very, especially with what we're seeing, I think that would be a really cool thing, especially with Joe. I mean, that could be our success, like the iteration of that. Yeah, there's definitely a lot of opportunities and potential.

22:38 - Mekaiel Abdullahi
I just wanted to circle back on when things that Kelsey do and spends time on other than like, what are some things that he does and spends time on that you wish he didn't?

22:57 - Nicole Howard
H 就會 would just say, like, I just wish he wasn't A full-time technician. I wish, like, maybe he could help the technicians out when they're overwhelmed with jobs, but I just wish that he would spend more time running the business instead of working in it. I would like him to, you know, go out and make connections with people. That's what he's really good at. I mean, when we go to trade shows, he talks to different companies, new dealers, becomes dealers, makes those connections with other companies, and he's just... That's what he's really good at, and I think that's what would help the business grow, versus right now, we're just trying to keep up with the calls, you know? Like, I wish we had somebody to handle the calls, and while that person's handling that, Kelsey can go out and create more business, make more connections, network with people, and that's where the growth is. Right now, we're just trying to keep our head above water, I guess. Yeah.

23:58 - Mekaiel Abdullahi
Would you say, saving Kelsey? About 10 hours, about saving him about 10 hours to do those higher leverage things would be like a success at the end of this transformation. When's the end of the transformation?

24:12 - Nicole Howard
I would just say at the end of like, you know, like we're at a starting point now.

24:17 - Mekaiel Abdullahi
Like when we do implement the tools and the processes to get us to our end vision, I was just trying to define like what success would look like. Being able to save him like 10 hours out of his week to go do those higher leverage things. Would that be like a successful transformation as in like we implemented processes and steps to free up some of that time?

24:39 - Nicole Howard
I think that it would be an aspect of success. Yes.

24:45 - Mekaiel Abdullahi
Anything you guys want to add on that? Would it be more hours?

24:49 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Because the vision is that he's able to step away. Completely. Yeah.

24:55 - Nicole Howard
You know, like maybe spend five hours helping, but I wanted to.

25:02 - Chris Andrade
I'm going to take this one, Mekaiel, because I think you, and I understand why, and the number, we have a question, and Kelsey has mentioned multiple times about Pinetop, right, and his goal, you guys want to go up to Pinetop more often, right, and I think we have a good idea of what's blocking that, right, and I think what you're trying to say is a key to success would be being able to go up there more, and Kelsey, like, your vision, sipping on his coffee, being able to do a service call from his balcony, right, that's what kind of, like, success would look like to you, right?

25:41 - Nicole Howard
Oh, yeah, so, like, the whole video thing would be phenomenal if we had him work for a full year recording every single service call, and then making those into, you know, nice videos that are easy to understand, and somebody else can follow and do it themselves. And making that a platform that if someone were to pay for the rest of the video, they could solve their own problem, you know, and I would really like to monetize it because anybody over the world can replace their T930 belt and pay, instead of a service call paying Kelsey 250 bucks, they can pay 99 bucks and they can do it themselves and they can buy the part from us and we just drop ship, direct ship it to them, drop ship it to them. And then he could be making money by sitting on his balcony, sipping his coffee and the person calls. Oh, you need a belt. That's what you need here. Click on this video. Watch the video. Oh, I'm not technically savvy. Do you have a grandson? He can come over and do it, you know, have a little toolkit because they all take the same screws and the same screwdrivers and send them the little toolkit, you know, unscrew these screws. It's pretty simple. I mean, I could probably do it if I lost them.

26:57 - Chris Andrade
We'll get like a little marketing. here you go. Thank you for being a valued customer. Oh, that's a good idea, actually. I like that. That's cool.

27:06 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Another thing I just thought of is maybe even a potential market is training for plotter mechanics, like people who are, you know, who are training to learn this skill.

27:18 - Chris Andrade
Like the school environment, you know how school is, schools environment, like, like, it sounds like Nikki's like, so I don't know if you're familiar with schools. It's a Alex from OC products. Ultimately, at the end of the day, specialists like Kelsey can have a platform where people go to get, they, it's like, I believe it's like a paid subscription. So it's almost like people pay to follow Kelsey. Yeah. Yeah.

27:49 - Nicole Howard
So it's like value attainment master class, something like that.

27:52 - Chris Andrade
Yeah, exactly. Exactly. Exactly. Yeah.

27:55 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
That's a community aspect too. So there's, if you have your school community, so. Kelsey could have a school community he sets up that can be a free tier of like you get this free information and then if you want to subscribe, you get to interact more with the community and you can pay whatever tier we set up or you guys set up, however that looks.

28:16 - Nicole Howard
I don't, you know, anything's possible, but I don't foresee people being like, oh my gosh, there's this plotter guy and I really have to follow him. Like I just, it's more like my plotter's broke. How do I fix it? And how do I do it the cheapest way possible? I feel like that would be solving the problem and the need. Oh, I could watch this video and pay a hundred bucks or I have to pay him 250 to drive out here and do it for me. And there's still going to be a lot of those people that are like, I'm going to pay the 250. don't want to touch the damn thing. There's also a huge community of people across the nation that would gladly fix it themselves and pay a hundred bucks to fix it.

28:53 - Mekaiel Abdullahi
And I think that all starts with getting the information in Kelsey's brain on paper and then disseminated, right? Right.

29:00 - Nicole Howard
And so like the good thing about Kelsey is like typically when you have a technician, they have gone to training so like HP, Muto, Mamaki, Roland, they all offer technicians training and to be to be a dealer for these large corporations, you have to have a technician so you sell the equipment, and you have to have a technician that's able to repair or fix or do whatever that plotter needs. So Kelsey's gone through all of these trainings, like he's gone through HP, Roland, Mamak, Muto, I've been to Muto training, I'm a certified technician on training, fixing a print head on a Muto, I can do it. But having all of those different, just all that knowledge from the different types of plotters and him being able to fix it, even if he's never even seen that brand or type, he knows how to fix it. It's because he's so. Well-versed in the whole schematic scheme, like mechanics of the machines that he could figure it out. It's pretty impressive. If you follow him for a year and you record every single service call, I think that's what's going to change the business from him working in it to being to work away from it, you know, and still create and generate money. Revenue. That's a goal.

30:33 - Chris Andrade
Like, that's true.

30:36 - Mekaiel Abdullahi
Thank you for sharing that. That's awesome. Like, I want to talk about a little bit of your, more of your role in like the bookkeeping stuff. So I just want to kind of get an estimate of how many hours a week do you allocate to bookkeeping work?

30:52 - Nicole Howard
I would say I'm working 25 to 30 hours a week on bookkeeping. um But I don't want to do this. Like, this isn't my goal. I'm only doing this because he needs somebody to do it. And the last person he hired to do it stole a bunch of money from him. So I don't want to do this. I'm applying to law school. I have different dreams and goals. I'm only doing this because he needs help and I'm available. So ultimately, I don't want to be doing this job.

31:25 - Mekaiel Abdullahi
Thank you for sharing that with us, to be honest, because I honestly didn't, I wasn't never aware of that.

31:31 - Chris Andrade
And you being a lawyer, like that's, that's, that's like, that's a mission. Like those goals, like, I mean, for us, not only helping us, us allowing us to help Kelsey, we're also helping you too. So that's even, that's, yeah. Thank you for sharing that. That's the goal.

31:49 - Mekaiel Abdullahi
How does, how does, does, uh, information come from, uh, Jobber, like the invoices and flow into QuickBooks? It's a syncing, uh, Yeah.

32:00 - Nicole Howard
I don't know, anything that happens in Jobber, it pushes that information. So if an invoice is generated, it just pushes that information over to QuickBooks. I can't do anything in Jobber bookkeeping related. That's why I have to have QuickBooks. QuickBooks manages the bank accounts, the amounts, checks that are written. I can only write checks from QuickBooks. I can't do it in Jobber. Jobber is more of a workflow system, work management system, where you can schedule, create appointments, know, schedule jobs. And it's very good at creating a workflow and making you go through those processes until the invoice is closed. QuickBooks is more for me, like I manage the vendors and POs and paying the bills and that aspect. So I need QuickBooks. of e 0 And the workflow side, Kelsey, more needs Jobber. Got it.

33:04 - Mekaiel Abdullahi
Is there any manual entry of, like, any data that you have to do back and forth between the two? Manual entry data.

33:12 - Nicole Howard
So, I mean, it's basically pretty simple. We get a call. We set up a service call. The manual entry would be creating an invoice. So boom, travel, service call, 250 bucks, add the parts on. If we don't have the part in the system already and it's a new part that we haven't purchased, then we have to manually input that part in. We buy this part for this much. This is how much we sell it for. Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. That's pretty much the manual.

33:41 - Mekaiel Abdullahi
So all of that stuff is up front in Jobber and then it automatically syncs to QuickBooks and pushes it out. Is there any, like, invoices that get lost or delayed when you do that sync? Or have you noticed any issues with that between the two systems? I haven't noticed any.

33:58 - Nicole Howard
There's a couple little I tweaks and NICs that I've found, but I know how to correct them. So like, here's one thing that I have to manually do. If a customer puts a deposit down, and then the invoice is created, and then they pay the rest between the two, like the final amount, they pay that amount, I have to manually go in to QuickBooks and apply that deposit to the invoice. Otherwise, it just shows that there was a deposit made, and it doesn't know that that deposit goes with that invoice. So I have to manually do that. And I found that like little tweak because I would be like, you owe us money. And they're like, No, no, I don't. I'm like, Oh, Jobber saying you don't. QuickBooks is saying you do. And then I go in there and it's showing the deposit, but it's unapplied to the invoice. And I'm like, Okay, that makes sense.

34:52 - Mekaiel Abdullahi
I have to apply it. Just to make sure I understood that that was a lot done back. So you said you, you take the you, So someone pays a deposit, and you create the invoice into Jobber, and then when it pushes to QuickBook, it doesn't recognize that deposit, and it doesn't tie that deposit to that invoice. Is that correct? Correct.

35:17 - Nicole Howard
And then one other thing Jobber doesn't do is... It's still a new product. So over time, I think they're coming out with new features with it, but it doesn't have the ability to allocate money into different accounts. So if I say, oh, I received this check for this amount from this customer tied to this invoice, I have four different business accounts that I operate out of. Credit card deposits go into this account. Check deposits go into this account. Here's my operating account. Any money that goes out comes out of the operating account. And I think there's one other one, but... I can't tell Jobber that I'm putting that money into this account. It just goes into one space, and then I have to manually do it in QuickBooks, tell it where it's going. Does that make sense?

36:13 - Mekaiel Abdullahi
Yeah. So regarding the bookkeeping, you heard a little bit about the frustrations of Jobber and QuickBooks. Are there any other tools that you use or are frustrated with?

36:28 - Nicole Howard
Alyssa could probably touch more on that aspect. She deals with the Shopify account. We'll get an order in, and I don't really know how she handles it, but she's got it figured out, thank God, because I have no clue. She figured it out. I don't know where it goes from Shopify, if it goes to Jobber, or if she has to make something in Jobber, but we do deal with Shopify. And our website, I don't know if that's tied to Shopify. I'm not sure that's something on Alyssa's question. together. Yeah. Would be, yeah.

37:03 - Chris Andrade
Can I ask a question real quick about QuickBooks? Yeah. My understanding you guys got your QuickBooks reconciled, uh, January one.

37:13 - Nicole Howard
Oh, so we're close. Um, I was planning on going to my sister's tomorrow and we're going to tidy it all up. I think.

37:24 - Chris Andrade
Is there a reason why it's so hard to keep your books reconciled? Is there a specific category or specific constraint that makes reconciling your books a pain?

37:40 - Nicole Howard
Um, well, before I started this job, there was somebody else doing it. And that other person, great person, love them. Um, did the best that he could, but he also wasn't a bookkeeper. So it wasn't getting done.

37:58 - Chris Andrade
There was no reconciled.

38:00 - Nicole Howard
And so I had to hire a professional bookkeeper to reconcile the past three years. And that costs a lot of money. I know how to reconcile now. They taught me. So now I'm, you know, the one doing it. It's still a tricky, it's still a tricky thing. Like one little cent can be off and you're not able to reconcile.

38:21 - Chris Andrade
Like I'm not a professional bookkeeper.

38:23 - Nicole Howard
I have my bachelor's, but I didn't go to school for accounting. Like I took accounting classes. 101, 102, 205. I took them, but I'm not, that's not my goal. I don't want to be an accountant. So I need a professional doing it. And, uh, I don't want to be that professional. I want to, I want to do something else. I appreciate that.

38:46 - Chris Andrade
Thank you for sharing with that. I just, one of those things that, uh, just was sticking the back of my head that I had to ask. So thank you. Um, anything else on bookkeeping, Matthew?

38:58 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Uh, no, I don't have any questions about that right now.

39:03 - Nicole Howard
We started this company in 2020. Wow, yeah, yeah. We're literally like 20 January 2020 is when we started in the garage. That's just incredible. But and we didn't know how to do anything. Okay, like, Kelsey, all he knew is his business and how to run it and work and like not run it, but like, how to fix things. That's all he knew. So he just went out and knocked doors called me cold calls.

39:35 - Mekaiel Abdullahi
Hey, do you need anything?

39:36 - Nicole Howard
Here's my number, blah, blah, blah. Like, so we got QuickBooks, not knowing how to use it. And I wasn't working with him when he first started. I mean, I was there as support help fill out paperwork and stuff like that. But I was going to school full time. I was at the university just grinding away for four years. During that time, I just graduated. That's huge. Congratulations. I wasn't in it. So our QuickBooks, why we're starting over with a fresh new one is because we have five years of Experience. Information in this one QuickBooks that's not necessarily valuable to us anymore. And a lot of it is just like, you know, we were learning. So like we labeled things a certain way and now we don't use that labeling system anymore. Like we figured out a smarter, more efficient way where. So there's a bunch of information in this QuickBooks that's irrelevant. Like we don't need it. We need to get rid of it. But in QuickBooks, you can't delete things. You can't delete it. Like it would be so easy for me if I could just go delete, delete, delete and get rid of all the junk.

40:49 - Mekaiel Abdullahi
I can't do that. I have to start over fresh.

40:52 - Nicole Howard
And that's another pain point. Like I have to start with a clean slate and then input everything in fresh so that going forward. And why would that be good?

41:04 - Chris Andrade
Just so you can get started with a quick, fresh book, QuickBooks, that is just clean up your reconciliation from five years of craziness? Yeah. Yeah.

41:17 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
So I have a question around, so you mentioned that somebody else was doing the accounting and the books. And the reason, one of the big reasons is it's, so now it's hard to trust somebody to do the books because like, obviously like somebody, you know, screwed you guys over and took money. So like, what I'm wondering is how, how are we going, how can, how can you get freed from this? Like, is there a way that if you have someone else doing it, have you thought of like, are there just certain things that we can check? maybe year post, No, your And just maybe someone on your side just checks their work and then just verifies things, but they do the bulk of the accounting work.

42:12 - Nicole Howard
So I think that ultimately I'm going to hire out a professional company to do this. Like, I don't want to look at it. I don't want to touch it. I don't want to deal with it. My goal is to go to law school and I'll be focusing on that. So hiring a full time company that manages my books, they come to me with the taxes and say sign here and I don't want to think about it ever again. Like, I'll be happy with that. And I'm willing to pay, you know, the monthly fee. I think it's like three hundred dollars a month just for basic bookkeeping and then, you know, additional charges to get your taxes done. I have to do 1099 by the 15th. I'm dreading, but I just want somebody else to do that. For me, I have somebody in mind that they offer that as a service and there. They're a professional, like they're a professional company. Versus we hired somebody. And, you know, when you have somebody that you just hire and they work for you and you pay them $20 an hour and they see $5,000 in the account, they think, hmm, I can skim a little bit here and skim a little bit there. And then you don't really notice it right away. But after time, you're like, wait a minute, something's funky going on here. Yeah.

43:27 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
So maybe the biggest blocker to getting your time back from doing that is justifying that expense to hire that company. Absolutely. Okay. You're giving us straight gold, Nicole.

43:43 - Chris Andrade
Like, this is beautiful. Thank you.

43:49 - Mekaiel Abdullahi
The last, one of the last things I wanted to ask is just like, what would success look like for you personally for this project? We, I know we talked about in detail. A lot of different things, but I kind of just wanted that. So. Okay, now that we went through everything, what would success look like in this project? Well, my goals are different than the company's goals.

44:09 - Nicole Howard
My goals are different, but I want Kelsey to be able to retire still generating a revenue. That's what my goals are for him. I want him not working in the business every day. You have no idea what his day, like this morning, he got up at 4, went to Bible study, delivered a plotter. I mean, like he's been go, go, go all day and he probably won't get home till six o'clock tonight or whenever. You know, yesterday he drove all the way to Prescott and back. That's just too much. He needs to get more of his time back. And if he were to be able to record these videos and monetize it, I think that would give him the freedom to allow people to work for themselves and fix things themselves. And, and he can still, I mean, like when we, when you. If up this market to nationwide, I mean, that's just an incredible thing that you can offer versus only being able to service people in Arizona. You know, there's a lot of people out there that want this knowledge and I mean, I think it's something that he can monetize himself and then still just being able to, you know, that's what I want. I don't want him waking up at four, driving all over the freaking state and not coming home. Like that's my goals are different. My goals are.

45:36 - Mekaiel Abdullahi
I think that aligned, actually, that aligns with the overall goal of bringing up Kelsey's time in order to do so. There's some knowledge that lives only in his head that we need to document and get down, which will allow him to leverage that and in different in different ways as well, you know. A hundred percent.

45:55 - Chris Andrade
And man, like just an outsider seeing in like, man, I. You just. I wish I could just go like this, and it'd all be fixed, right? But obviously, that's not the case. So we will be the ones to help get you there, though. I can tell you that.

46:15 - Mekaiel Abdullahi
That was all the questions I had, or that we had for you. Is there anything that we talked about that you wanted to expand on, or any final thoughts? I got a couple questions that I would like to ask if that's okay.

46:33 - Chris Andrade
I know we're not making any suggestions, but you mentioned that things happen that create Kelsey to go stir-crazy, right? Especially when he's taking the phone, or he's on a service call, and he's already knees-deep in a service call, and then he hears his phone ringing. He's like, he doesn't have to answer it, but because Kelsey's Kelsey, and he He's just a people's pleaser, he's like this, he's like trying to get me, right, if there was a way to like, okay, Kelsey showed up to this job site, maybe we can turn his phone off or have something where it gets messaged through Jobber or something like that, you know, to, like, do you think if we could just block Kelsey from society for that service call? Does that seem beneficial to you at all?

47:34 - Nicole Howard
So, we've done that before, and we ran into several issues with it. So, the way that we did it in the past was Kelsey would go to a service call, he would forward all of his calls to the office, and then there was just issues like, he would forget to un-forward it, and then he'd be driving, and then I'd be trying to call him, and then it would be going to the office. And then I can't get ahold of them. it's like, it's just chaos. Right, right.

48:05 - Chris Andrade
So when you're using Emanuel's staff to do that, he forgot to unmanually check it and then it created chaos because of it. Yeah. And then you can't get ahold of him, but he's thinking, man, my phone's not ringing.

48:19 - Nicole Howard
This is great. And like, if you click, it's like, well, your phone's not ringing.

48:22 - Chris Andrade
Oh, it's like you're going to go and set a photo shoot and you forgot to push record. Yeah, I get it.

48:30 - Mekaiel Abdullahi
I get it all the time. Not a problem.

48:32 - Chris Andrade
Um, thank you. And, uh, yeah, that's, that's again, it's something that I think can help free up Kelsey's time. But ultimately I was curious to why it hasn't been done, but thank you for sharing that it has been done and you told us why it didn't work. So that's gold again. Um, when you were talking about the training, you mentioned documents or like you guys went through the schedule to train, you went through a special training. Kelsey's went through all of them. Do you guys get any type of documentation about the printers or any kind of documentation that you guys have, like a repository of user manuals that are digital? Or are they all hard copies? How does that look? Like, where's all that stored?

49:22 - Nicole Howard
So every company has a digital on their website manuals. I'm not certain where to find them. I know we've got a lot of them saved in our cloud, whatever it's called. Is it Google Drive or iCloud or? No, it's like a server or some sort. I don't know what it is. But we have a space where all of our work computers store information. And a lot of our user manuals are in there that we can refer to. As far as training goes. So get materials while you're there, but you don't really use them because a lot of this training is hands on. It's okay, pull this apart, pull the covers off, use screws. You know, it's not like take a written test and write things down. It's like you visually have to do it yourself and touch it. Um, so when I went to training, I probably got like a certificate that I don't have anymore, but they still, they still, the company knows I'm registered as a, I'm certified to do this job basically.

50:32 - Chris Andrade
Um, is, is that, is those certification announced anywhere? Like, are you guys, can you guys say that we are like, have a list of all the certifications you guys have?

50:46 - Nicole Howard
Kelsey has certifications for, for 20 years. However, a lot of those certifications are held with his old company. So you also have to be a dealer in order to work on a lot of these things. So, like, the old company has a lot of that information. Kelsey doesn't necessarily need it. He just knows how to do it. So it's like, hire me and I'll fix it for you. Like, I don't really need, you know, that side of things. But if he needs help with, like, calling the manufacturer, some of them won't speak to him because he's not technically a technician for one of their dealers anymore. Gotcha. And quick question.

51:30 - Chris Andrade
You said that the cloud, who has, who's, who, somebody needs it. Is it only Kelsey who has access to the cloud or does Alyssa have it or Joe?

51:39 - Nicole Howard
So all of our office computers do. I don't have, I could have access to it at my home office. You have to worry about it.

51:45 - Chris Andrade
I'll get that through our discovery with Alyssa and Joe and Kelsey too. It's, it's on my work computer at the office.

51:52 - Nicole Howard
I can access it. I only, I save stuff on there like work projects, print jobs.

51:59 - Mekaiel Abdullahi
just, um,

52:00 - Nicole Howard
Tax information, W-9s, user manuals, service manuals. I mean, all that stuff's on there. Logos from the very beginning, like we'd create a logo and, you know, all that information is saved on there. Oh, that's good.

52:19 - Chris Andrade
And my last question, I promise we're wrapping up. We're at four minutes left. You mentioned Jobber through your issues with QuickBooks. Is there any other issues with Jobber that you, particularly you, have that you don't like? You could elaborate more on? Is there anything in Jobber particularly that you like that you want to enhance or you don't like anything?

52:54 - Nicole Howard
I don't like or dislike. It's a tool. I think. It's doing what it's made for. There's no like or dislike for me. There's plenty of software systems out there, and they all basically probably do the same thing. This is just the one that we use right now, and it's better than what we were using before. So it's just a tool. Awesome.

53:27 - Chris Andrade
I mean, I'm tapped out, guys. I got everything off that I wanted to. Is there any questions that you guys have? I don't have anything.

53:37 - Mekaiel Abdullahi
Matthew?

53:39 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
No, I think we got some good information, and we'll go back and look through it all. I don't have any other questions right now. Nicole, is there anything you want to Nicole?

53:50 - Mekaiel Abdullahi
I'm sorry?

53:51 - Chris Andrade
Do you have any questions for us?

53:55 - Mekaiel Abdullahi
Nope.

53:56 - Nicole Howard
I don't think so. I think we covered a lot today. today. together. We covered Okay. I Alyssa's leaving town tomorrow through Monday, so I don't know when you'll be able to meet with her. Yeah, so I was not aware of that.

54:11 - Chris Andrade
I was planning on trying to reach out to her and see if we could get an interview maybe later this week, but since she just told me that, I won't even bother her until next week if you're okay with you might be able to get, if you guys are busy today, you might be able to fit her in today. Okay, let me, yeah, let me check our schedules. See, this is part of the miscommunication. I wish Kelsey would have told me that. Because then I would have preemptively scheduled that immediately after. But let me see what we can work up. I can't make any promises, but I will try.

54:43 - Nicole Howard
And she also said that she might, she's going to be working from where she's at. So wherever she's going, she's still going to be working. She might be able to squeeze you guys in later this week. I'd rather you guys do it sooner rather than later.

54:55 - Chris Andrade
You said she's off. So today's her last day of work. So she's off tomorrow. Yeah.

55:00 - Nicole Howard
Yeah, she's leaving tomorrow, but she's still going to be working from wherever she's working. She's she just does that. She just she's available to help and assist.

55:09 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
So can we get her availability so we can sync up with our calendars, like for today and for whenever she's planning to do you want me to call her?

55:21 - Nicole Howard
Yeah. Sure.

55:28 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
So I might have a call at 12 and then we have that call at three.

55:33 - Chris Andrade
besides that, I think we really don't have our questions engineered for her either, though, do we kind of do you want to just do you think it'd be wise just to have a kind of the same kind of question format that we have here and just run off of that?
ACTION ITEM: Draft Alyssa interview questions from Nicole transcript - WATCH: https://fathom.video/share/LTt4tHVVa9HuHcf-3YsY6dnb7y5xUSa_?timestamp=3351.9999
