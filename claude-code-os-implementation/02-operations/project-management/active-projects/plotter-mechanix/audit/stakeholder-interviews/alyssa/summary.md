## Meeting Purpose

To map Plotter Mechanics' operational workflows, focusing on Alyssa's role and pain points.

---

## Key Takeaways

- Alyssa is the operational bottleneck. She manages all incoming communication (calls, texts, 10 email inboxes) and manually updates Jobber, creating a single point of failure and preventing her from taking time off without working.
- Kelsey's communication style is the primary workflow disruptor. He dictates rambling updates to Alyssa, bypassing Jobber's self-entry features. This forces her to interrupt her work to manually enter data, causing delays and errors.
- The RMA process is broken. Ink vendors (e.g., STS Inks) deny RMAs for stock held >30 days, forcing Kelsey to intervene and leaving defective product on the shelf for months.
- Print services are unprofitable. They are priced too low and waste materials, serving only to keep machines running. The Shopify portal is ineffective because customers order the wrong ink and prefer direct contact.

## Topics

### Alyssa's Role & Daily Workflow

- Alyssa is the operational center, managing all incoming communication and Jobber updates.
- Her day (8:30-9:00 AM start) involves:
  - Reviewing emails & texts for new jobs.
  - Invoicing completed jobs from the prior day.
  - Scheduling new service calls & deliveries.
  - Managing the parts ordering workflow (quotes, POs, tracking).
  - Preparing parts for technicians using a dedicated shelf system.

### Communication & Scheduling Bottlenecks

- The primary workflow disruption is Kelsey's communication style, which forces manual work on Alyssa.
- **Communication Channels:**
  - **Kelsey's Personal Phone:** Top channel for customer orders and service requests, bypassing the office.
  - **Email:** Alyssa manages ~10 inboxes, which helps her prioritize but is inefficient.
  - **Jobber Text:** Used for post-scheduling updates (e.g., "on my way"); Kelsey likes it because it keeps business texts off his personal phone.
- **Scheduling Process:**
  - Kelsey prefers 3-4 service calls/day; >5 causes stress and long hours.
  - Alyssa must get Kelsey's approval for all new service appointments to avoid conflicts with his unstated priorities.
  - Kelsey will call Alyssa to move jobs on the Jobber calendar instead of using the app himself.

### Parts & RMA Process

- **Parts Ordering Workflow:**
  1. Tech identifies needed part.
  2. Alyssa gets vendor quote (24-48 hr turnaround).
  3. Alyssa sends customer quote, requiring upfront payment for parts.
  4. Upon payment, Alyssa places PO and tracks shipment.
  5. Part arrives → Job rescheduled for the next day.
- **RMA Process Failures:**
  - Ink vendors (e.g., STS Inks) deny RMAs for stock held >30 days, citing their return policy.
  - This forces Kelsey to intervene directly with vendor owners.
  - Result: Defective product sits on the shelf for months, unresolved.

### Order Fulfillment & Print Services

- **Fulfillment Channels:**
  - **Local Delivery:** For Phoenix-area customers, Joe delivers on his service route.
  - **Shipping:** For customers outside the Phoenix area (e.g., Sholo), orders are shipped.
  - **Drop Shipping:** Used for non-local orders or when office stock is low.
- **Shopify Portal Ineffectiveness:**
  - Customers rarely use the portal.
  - When they do, they often order the wrong ink, requiring Alyssa to call and correct the order.
- **Unprofitable Print Services:**
  - Print services are not profitable, often breaking even or losing money.
  - Purpose: To keep machines running, as inactivity causes breakdowns and ink drying.
  - Pricing is significantly lower than professional print shops.

## Next Steps

- **Alyssa:**
  - Locate and share the RMA procedure document with the team.
  - Journal operational pain points during time off for the next meeting.
- **Chris & Team:**
  - Schedule a follow-up meeting with Alyssa after her return.
