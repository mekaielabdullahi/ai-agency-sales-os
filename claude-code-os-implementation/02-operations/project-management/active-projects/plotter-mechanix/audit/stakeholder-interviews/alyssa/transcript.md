0:02 - Alyssa
All right, there we go.

0:04 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
You're on mute, Trent.

0:08 - Megan Howard
There, how about that?

0:09 - Alyssa
So it looks like we got Alyssa.

0:11 - Trent Christopher
Megan hadn't met you yet, so good to have you on here.

0:15 - Megan Howard
Yeah, I just wanted to participate in case there's anything I can help with. Yeah, appreciate you being on the call.

0:23 - Trent Christopher
I did hear a little bit about the conversation you guys had and it sounds like you have a lot of information on some of the systems for jobbers. So that's that's key to us understanding what's going on. Right.

0:36 - Chris Andrade
Yeah.

0:41 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
So, Alyssa, I know you're you're you're busy and we really appreciate your time because I think that you're like from. So we've learned a little bit like we've learned a good amount about plotter mechanics and like it seems like you're the center of so much that goes on. So So, you know, just really appreciate your time, and I, so it seems like you're kind of like the glue that holds it all together in a lot of ways, you know, like the information that goes into Jobber, a lot of it goes through you, pretty much all of it, right?

1:18 - Alyssa
Pretty much.

1:18 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
And so, yeah, we're starting to understand your role from the outside in, but we're really excited to understand your perspective, you know, from the inside out. And what you think about everything, and so, at the end of the day, we're here because we want to make, we want to try and make your day better, if we can, I really think we can, we're, but we need your help to really understand, you know, what's going on from, from your point of view. So, we're trying to get everyone's point of view and perspectives, and so, you know, we know there's a lot on your plate. And, um, basically. Basically. We really appreciate your time. know you're going out of town tomorrow. And we're kind of wondering, like, what does that look like? What is out of time? Or what is time out of the office look like for you? And like, how, how is everything going to be held together without you being here in person? Well, I bring my laptop with me.

2:17 - Alyssa
So if Kelsey has questions, he just sends a text message. When I have the time, I get to it, I give him a call back, we'll see what's going on, update everything in the system for like, an hour. Because I have my laptop with me, so I can access everything. And that's normally how we keep things rolling. Got it.

2:35 - Megan Howard
Okay.

2:36 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
So are you, are you going out of town for, for work? Or is it for a vacation, like time off? That's time off.

2:46 - Alyssa
Got it. Okay. And then what is it?

2:48 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
So you mentioned that it's usually how you do things when you do that. So what does it usually look like for you when you get back?

2:58 - Alyssa
Usually the first thing I do is try. Try to catch Kelsey to go over his calendar, because sometimes things pile up, depending, so the first thing we do is get that straightened out, figure out what he wants to do today, figure out what he wants to do tomorrow, get it spread out a little bit, and then move everything around on the schedule. He usually heads off to do his service calls. I'm going through emails and texts, trying to see what else is going on, adding it to the calendar. If it's something important, I'll usually contact Kelsey, see if he's going to be able to do that today or tomorrow, but normally I'd put it off for tomorrow and then we go over the schedule again. Got it.

3:48 - Megan Howard
Okay.

3:51 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
So is that, it's, it sounds almost like it's, I guess there's a lot of stuff that piles up, but so switch. ... Speaking gears a little bit, can you walk me through like your typical day? So what does a typical day look like from start to finish? Like if you're, you know, let's say it's not vacation time anymore, but you're just a typical normal day, you know, what does it usually look like?

4:16 - Chris Andrade
If you could be a little bit more like a special key or like a different type of lock that you have to punch a code, you don't have to give us the code, but we're trying to get to that level of detail. Like when you pull up, you have to unlock the door, like, you know, like, just kind of give us your routine of what does your morning look like? And how does you get, how do you get your day started? If you don't mind. Okay. Um, let's see.

4:43 - Alyssa
I roll up to the office. I have to undo the padlock and then I punch in a code in order to access the main door. I walk in, um, the security system starts doing that little beeping thing. I have to punch in another code to disarm that. I up the right. Bye. Tell Alexa to turn on the lights, I get to the desk, I grab the office phone, and then the first thing I normally do is go through emails, see what's been going on, what I need to get on the schedule, then I'll check texts, see if Kelsey messaged anything like after hours or something about any work she's done, any jobs, then I go over the jobs in the system to see if I missed anything, because usually I'm usually out of here around 4.35, 4.30 or 5 p.m. And sometimes Kelsey takes longer on jobs, or Joe is finishing up a delivery or something. So they'll put in notes, they'll check mark the job is completed, but it hasn't been invoiced, so I've to make sure that it does get invoiced, at least by the next day. And in between that, I might get some calls, so I'll have to pause, I'll have to put in more information, move things around on the schedule. And then throughout the day, if something happens on a service call, then either Kelsey or Joe, whoever's on that service call, will usually call me and say, hey, so I'm done with the service call, but don't close it out yet. It's a continuation. We need to quote this person on parts, additional travel and labor for installing those parts. They're still having trouble. So send them a quote, get them to approve it, pay for the parts and shipping if they want to continue. Once they pay for the parts and shipping, then I have to order it. So I put in a PEO after Kite Comfort and Payment, the vendor will ship out the parts. I got to keep track of that. Tell Kelsey when the part. A lot of times we don't get the tracking information, so I have to keep pestering, like, hey, where's the tracking? Or maybe I miss it in the emails because I have, like, how many inboxes do we have, like 10? A lot of inboxes. Usually it goes to accounting, but sometimes it goes to Kelsey's, sometimes it goes to info or sales. So yeah, I got an update on when that's coming in. I moved the job over to the day that we're supposed to get, the day after we were supposed to get that part, because usually the parts come in around noon, afternoon, and by then there's no way Kelsey's going to go back out there to do the service call. It's too late. He's already on today's service calls. So I set that aside. We have a special shelf. Megan helped us create a little shelf area where I put all the deliveries, and then I put all the service call items, and then we just, at the very top, we, um, Just keep a stock of stuff. So when he comes in the next day, he can go straight to that service shelf. He'll see the part on there. It's in the box. I stick a note on it for the company that it's for. So he knows immediately, oh yeah, this is for, I don't know, that one print place over in Mesa or something. Okay, great. He'll grab it and he can just go. Let's see. What else? Same thing with deliveries. Someone places an order. Usually they call in or they email. Occasionally I get it as a request through Jobber. So I turned that into a job. I put it on the schedule for the next day. I usually put it under Joe because he's the one who normally handles deliveries now. Unless Kelsey's going to that location, but usually it's Joe handling it. And then I print out that order. I check it. I pull the stuff from the shelves. I put in a box or if it's paper, I just put it directly on the delivery shelf. So when Joe comes in the next day, he'll see the delivery shelf has deliveries to do and he'll just grab those. Or like this morning, we had like two deliveries and both Joe and Kelsey were at the office this morning. So I was able to pull those immediately in the morning, tell them, hey, Joe, you have two deliveries today that I just saw. They came in this morning, literally. So I got those prepared for him. He grabbed them. He headed out. Hey, listen, real quick.

9:46 - Chris Andrade
What time does your day start? What time do you pull up? Hold up.

9:51 - Alyssa
Give me one moment. Usually I get here around 830 to 9am. Okay.

9:57 - Chris Andrade
Give me one moment. Go ahead. No worries. And Megan, while she's answering the phone call, I think I put you on mute because I was getting some feedback. Let me unmute you there. Is there anything you'd like to, while she's on the phone, is there anything you'd like to add to that?

10:13 - Megan Howard
No, that sounds like the gist of it. It's obviously not the detailed level of it, but that's pretty much the gist of the process. You know, it comes in either, like she said, email, phone, text. Uh, requests online and she has to kind of juggle and decide what needs to be done with it, whether it's a quote or a job or, and it, you know, it gets put on the calendar. They go do it. Usually there's more, it's not usually a one and done kind of thing. You know, it's going to need more after the initial meeting with them. And then she has to order the parts. Once they come in. Put it back on the schedule like it's it's the simplified dumbed-down version of it. Got it. And is there a thing that also takes place sometimes is if something didn't work properly, like a ink cartridge that we sold, we might have to ship it back and we have to track that. It's called an RMA and we have to get the part from the client, send it to the company we bought it from, get a credit for it. And we usually have one in stock so we can give them one that we have off the shelf and we have to make sure that we don't get invoiced for it. And there's a process for that. That had kind of peaked in the system and it looks like that might have gone a little bit to the wayside, Alyssa, oh she's not there, okay. Um, there was a way to track it in the system, but she might be just doing it manually, but it really should be done in two ways.

12:09 - Chris Andrade
And Megan, just so you know, we realize how much of a integral part Alyssa and you are. And just so you know, just to set an expectation, this might have to be like a multi interview process, just because there's so much information. Right. Um, that, that turnaround time from the time that you have to, for the RMA, you, you, luckily you guys, uh, anticipate that so you can give the customer, um, happiness, right? You're satisfying their, uh, I guess pain right away. Right. Good job for you guys. But the turnaround time that it takes for you to get that part back. Is there a time that that usually takes? Um, it just kind of varies. Um, it happens. hard. Yeah.

13:00 - Megan Howard
How it occurred if, you know, Kelsey went out there and it didn't work while he was there, he'll just bring it back or if he's out in the, if they called and said it didn't work, then he'll stop by a lot of times and pick it up. That's kind of a manual process, depending on where it's at and how it was delivered. It varies, unfortunately. And then once we do get it back, usually we try to, you'd have to ask Alyssa, but I think. We often just send one out there and swap it out like at the same time kind of thing, or sometimes they're not close by, so we have to ship it to them. Gotcha.

13:41 - Chris Andrade
And you said that we got, you got to keep track to make sure they don't double charge you. Why is that?

13:46 - Megan Howard
The vendor, cause we, they reimburse us for the bag cartridge and we already pay for it on an invoice. And luckily it doesn't happen too often, but it's a. case, ghost, Ain't It can be a tedious process where you have to track. A lot of times, if it's just ink, they don't want it back. They believe you and whatnot. So they'll just give you a credit on your next invoice, but you have to make sure that happens. And how do you make sure that happens?

14:21 - Chris Andrade
By manually checking that, you said?

14:24 - Megan Howard
To be honest, I haven't been involved in that part of the process. I know I wrote down procedures for Alyssa on how to do that. I don't know if you got a copy of those yet. No, it's been kind of a crazy morning, if I'm being honest.

14:36 - Chris Andrade
That's what I was hoping to get with Ms. Alyssa, because we were referred to, there is like a central repository for everybody to access. We don't know if it's through iCloud, Google Docs, is it on, you know, other...

14:52 - Megan Howard
There's a server, and I think it's through Google, but that's not where it's going to be stored. Theoretically... Basically, she should be tracking the RMAs on the customer's name in Jobber, and the job would be called RMA, and we're, you know, that way if I go to Jobber and type RMA, I'll be able to see a list of all the ones that have been done. And she's supposed to be printing them out and reconciling it with the invoice with the vendor, so I'm not certain if all of that's still going down.

15:29 - Chris Andrade
Alyssa, she's, we're talking about the RMA process and how we track if a part was being returned properly, if it wasn't functioning right.

15:42 - Alyssa
It honestly breaks down when they start arguing with me. I have to get Kelsey involved, because a lot of the vendors, they're like, oh, you're past your 30-day return limit, but we keep things stuck on the shelf. Kelsey normally has, um. And understanding what the owners of our vendors that, well, we keep things on the shelf. Sometimes stuff happens to the stuff that's been sitting there. So we're supposed to be getting RMAs, but I don't know. They, they argue with me. And then I have to get, contact the owners of the companies. Like, for example, I think it's STS, Inks, Chris I had to communicate with him because we had this bag of ink explode on us basically. So there's ink everywhere. And the company is saying, Oh, okay. Well, um, you're past the 30 day limit for that ink. Cause the PO says, you know, the last time you ordered it was like three months ago, but it exploded on the shelf basically. So I'm trying to get an RMA for it. And they're saying, yeah, no, we can't do So then I have to So then I had to contact Kelsey to contact Chris.

17:05 - Chris Andrade
He sends him a text.

17:07 - Alyssa
Chris says, Oh yeah, you guys keep things on the shelf. So we should do an RMA. And then they never get back to me again. So then five months later, I'm still contacting them. I'm not getting responses back. And it just, it's still sitting here on the shelf. Yeah, that's frustrating. Yeah, I could imagine that'd be frustrating.

17:29 - Chris Andrade
Off the top of your head, how many vendors do you have to deal with that with? Like, just stop. It could be a guess. Don't have to be crazy. Just how many vendors do you have? Just about two. It's the two Inc.
ACTION ITEM: Find RMA procedures doc on server; send to Chris (email/text photos) - WATCH: https://fathom.video/share/H-KajtCt4r9JdwzQ_NbWQ62K4HV4BqdF?timestamp=1061.9999

17:40 - Alyssa
vendors that mainly give us problems. The parts vendors we normally get responses from, we figure it out. Arc imaging is pretty good. CES is pretty good. Yeah.

17:52 - Megan Howard
Alyssa, do you have the procedures that you and I created, um, saved in a electronic form? That you can... I know you printed it out for your binder, but do you still have it somewhere handy electronically that you can share? If not, you might have to scan it in and find it.

18:13 - Alyssa
You don't have to do it right now.

18:14 - Chris Andrade
We can get it. I'll be coming over there. I can help you or get it. Yeah, but thank you. If you can just tentatively, when you get back, I want you to enjoy your vacation, right? When you get back, maybe Kelsey or Joe knows where it's at, but yeah, we appreciate that. Yeah. It's a Word document somewhere on the server.

18:35 - Alyssa
I should be able to find it.

18:38 - Chris Andrade
Okay. Go ahead, Matt.

18:40 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
So I think our expectation for the time right now is we're aiming for like 40 more minutes. Is that good for everybody? Yeah, sure. Okay, cool. Thank you, Matthew. So in general, so I guess I have a question. A couple more questions we can get into, but, so, what, let's see, what's the most, like, if you zoom out and kind of think about your, the job as a whole, like, I know we just talked about RMAs, but it doesn't have to be that, but what's the most frustrating part of your job, do you think, right now?

19:23 - Megan Howard
And be completely honest, even if it involves keeping Kelsey on track. Yeah, we wanted to set up precedents, too.

19:33 - Chris Andrade
We forgot to go through this, and I apologize. But just so you know, this is just staying between us, right? We're not here to, like, go, honestly, we just want this safe environment. We want to produce a safe environment to get to, like, you know, we need to know, right? So this is a free space. We don't have, we can, we're ultimately trying to all say, like, be better and make the better. And you're at integral part to that. So it really helps, like, like, don't have any reservations. Okay, that's what I'm trying to do. Alyssa, that was the question.

20:22 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
So the question was just, what's the most frustrating part of your job right now, would you say?

20:45 - Alyssa
I think you have a bad internet connection there, Ms.

20:48 - Chris Andrade
Alyssa. I think we're getting a bit of lag.

20:54 - Alyssa
Are you connected to Wi-Fi?

20:59 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
I can turn turn it off. We off our cameras just to save bandwidth here.

21:08 - Alyssa
Okay. Oh, yeah, we can hear you much better.

21:11 - Chris Andrade
So, yeah, tell us, tell us, like, what's the most frustrating part about your day? I mean, is it Kelsey, like, or, like, just be open. It's safe space here. Hmm. Is everything running smoothly?

21:29 - Megan Howard
Do we have any hiccups? Is there anything that can get better? Well, I'm sure there's a lot that can get better.

21:37 - Alyssa
I'm just trying to think how to phrase it. We want to particularly focus on you right now.

21:47 - Chris Andrade
So, yeah, I know there's probably a lot, right? And let's just pick apart with the details that we've been talking about mainly, right? Like, you kind of know at the level... Where we're at, you kind of know what can be manageable, right? At first, is there something that, that you think could be really easy, but for whatever reason, it's complicated. And it's not, no worries. You can come back to it. You can think about it, but like, to move on, like, okay, think about a bad day. Like, like, what, what does a bad day look like? Like, what goes wrong? Let's go start from there.

22:51 - Alyssa
I guess when it's, there's just too much going on at once, um, I think the, The most frustrating day was when Kelsey was calling me over like half hour. Clients were calling asking about orders or parts coming in or something. And I'm trying to get all of it. And it's just one thing after the other without any breaks, consistently. And I'm trying to get everything into the system, try to figure out what day it's supposed to go on. In between trying to add more stuff to the calendar, because people are calling in with more service calls and orders. I'm also trying to update all of Kelsey's jobs. Because he's calling saying, okay, this, this person, they're going to need a motherboard or something. And we need to send them a quote, we need to give them to pay, send the PO out, and then schedule for us to come back out there. And then And then I have to put a pause on what I was doing, like getting an order together for a Another client in order to prioritize this because it's more important because this is already a job that's going and then I don't have the greatest memory that's why I have a ton of sticky notes everywhere on my desk so if for some reason I forget about that order that's really gonna suck I usually keep it as an open tab on the compute one one of the four screens that I have in front of me I just move it over or keep the tab open so then I come back to it and go like oh yeah I need to get this finished mm-hmm but I think that will probably be the most frustrating type of thing that's going on all right no yeah that's beautiful like juggling all the things yeah exactly because people they don't like to go through we have a service forum on plotter mechanics.com where they can fill it out and they can order stuff or they can order a service To get their printers fixed. But not many do that. Right. If they send an email, then that's fine because I can hold off on the email. I can focus on the calls. But if they're specifically all calling. Then that's when it gets a little frustrating.

25:24 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
So do you know like how many customer calls you might handle on like a typical day? On a typical day, maybe one or two.

25:33 - Alyssa
We don't normally have a lot of calls, but when they come in and if it's all at once, then it gets overwhelming.

25:41 - Chris Andrade
Yeah.

25:41 - Alyssa
Thankfully, usually they text or they email. So what would it look like on a day where they all come in at once?

25:48 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Is it like five calls? Is it 10 or 20? you know like general ballpark? Are we counting Kelsey's calls or not?

25:55 - Alyssa
No, just the customer calls, I guess, for now.

25:57 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Okay, then about five.

25:58 - Alyssa
Okay. But they like to come in batches. So within like an hour period, you get those five calls coming in one after the other. Yeah.

26:09 - Chris Andrade
How many calls he calls do you get in a day, you think? That depends on his day.

26:16 - Alyssa
But on average, I'd say he calls about five to eight times a day.

26:25 - Chris Andrade
So it's roughly right around 15 to 20 calls that you're having, that you're intaking a day. Well, that's on a busy day.

26:35 - Alyssa
Okay, cool. Perfect.

26:37 - Chris Andrade
Typical day, more like maybe 10.

26:40 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Typical day, more like about five.

26:43 - Alyssa
Okay.

26:46 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
I'd say the average would be around five.

26:48 - Alyssa
And that's usually just Kelsey calling to get me to update something. Or let me know what he did on his job, or me calling Kelsey to see what he did on his job. Sorry to interrupt, but at the.

27:00 - Megan Howard
At same time, she got five calls, but she also got five, ten emails, and another half a dozen or more texts, so it's very difficult to keep up with all of the various modes that things come in. Yeah, that would probably be the most frustrating part.

27:21 - Alyssa
They're all coming in from different directions, and I have to prioritize which ones I'm going to take. For me, it's always going to be the phone calls because I don't have those in a noted version.

27:33 - Chris Andrade
Right.

27:34 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
And so that's something that we're trying to get our minds around, too, is accessing all the ways that things come in. So like email, text, and the phone calls and texts, I guess it's through Vonage. Is it a business phone number? No, this is just right now.

27:55 - Megan Howard
The Vonage is the office number, but they're not... She's most of the Vonage services because it's complicated and a pain in the , but she has an iPhone for the office that Healthy Texts is, and then when he's talking with a customer, he'll do a group text with you and whoever, and it can get a little sideways and confusing on what's going on.

28:25 - Alyssa
I'd say the other frustrating thing is, I usually don't want my personal number being used for work stuff, but if Kelsey's busy, he will message the most recent phone number that he contacted or whatever, and creates group chats with either vendors or customers on my personal cell, and I'm just like, Kelsey, please.

28:51 - Chris Andrade
Yeah. Is there something that you wish Kelsey understood better about what you deal with? I feel like he understands it, but he's just

29:00 - Alyssa
He's so much going on that he's got to prioritize his own tasks.

29:07 - Megan Howard
Honestly, if they weren't all calling and texting Kelsey, and it was systematically funneling in either just all the phone calls or all emails or even just phone calls and emails, like it would be easier, but it kind of just depends on how Kelsey's day feels like. He could call you and then text you and then call you and then keep texting. And you're in three different group chats with him and this vendor and him and this customer and him being in the loop, which he really doesn't want. He doesn't want to be in the loop, but he wants to be in the loop.

29:46 - Alyssa
Yeah.

29:48 - Chris Andrade
Yeah.

29:48 - Megan Howard
He wants you to handle it and he should get over and get all the information out of the text, but most of the time it's very unclear what is needed. Yeah.

29:59 - Alyssa
He. A lot of people call his personal, well, his main phone number to get in contact with him directly rather than going through the office. And half the time, it's not always service stuff. It's just, hey, I need supplies. They could reach out to our office number for that because I'm the one sitting here. I see all the supplies in front of me. I can tell them if we have it or not and get them on the calendar. Kelsey, not so much.

30:27 - Chris Andrade
Does Kelsey get the wrong phone number or why is that?

30:33 - Megan Howard
You would have to ask him why that is. Most of it is because they know him and that's how he, because he does service for them too. If he's selling them supplies, he does service. So he'll call them from his cell phone and instead of just saying, hey, can you call my office and give them your order or send an email, which I've instructed him multiple times to do. He tries to facilitate the conversation. Which makes the whole process that much more complicated. When he's overwhelmed, he does do that.

31:07 - Alyssa
He tells them, hey, I can't do this right now. Call this number, press extension 2 to talk to the salesperson, which is me, basically. So, he does do that occasionally. Okay. Okay.

31:25 - Chris Andrade
Thank you. Go ahead, Matt. So, yeah.

31:34 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
So, I guess that kind of touched on something I was going to ask about. Like, what are the types of calls that you can fully handle without Kelsey? Because he has his area of expertise, but then there's things that you can handle that he doesn't necessarily have to, right? Yeah.

31:56 - Alyssa
Um, I can handle the delivery. handle a I If somebody wants ink or paper, I can handle that completely. I don't need him in that process. If somebody needs parts for their machine, I can figure that out as well now that I know who we're getting parts from and I can figure out the cost. I might want to double check with him occasionally, but usually I can handle that 100%. If they want to schedule a service like, oh, no, this giant HP printer they have over here is jammed and they can't find the jam. Okay, perfect. Let me put that on the schedule for Kelsey and then I'll just let Kelsey know at the end of the day or in the tomorrow morning or something that, hey, you have this person with a jam. Honestly, for the most part, she can handle 90% of the things that are incoming.

32:58 - Megan Howard
They don't need to go through.

33:02 - Alyssa
I'm just curious about the order fulfillment.

33:12 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
So when somebody wants supplies, it sounds like you're kind of working, like you understand the cost from the vendor and you can put together, is it like a quotation that you go back to them with? So that depends.

33:29 - Alyssa
If there's a customer who consistently orders like ink from us and they do it every few months or so, they know the cost. They don't want a quote. They just want it delivered. So I just confirm the address because some people have multiple addresses. I've got to figure out which one needs these inks. And I make it a job and I just send it off. If it's somebody who doesn't normally order this stuff. So. So. Thank Specifically, if it's parts, that's when we send a quote. Because the parts prices, well, over the past year, they've gone up. So we want to make sure they're aware of what they're getting into. Print heads cost a lot. Inks, they might be about $100, depending on your machine. But like print heads, motherboards, all that, that's a lot more. So yes, we send a quote for those. And his inks are less than everybody else's.

34:33 - Megan Howard
So that's not usually as necessary to get a quote out. But we changed the process because we've had situations where we buy the parts up front out of our pocket, we install the parts, we send them the invoice, and they don't want to pay it because they don't like the price. So we've changed that to where if it's a service call that needs parts, then we send them a quote. We've changed that we We get a quote from the vendors, what it costs us, we mark it up, send it out, and get their approval, and they have to pay for the parts up front, and then we invoice them for the balance, which is the labor, usually, and travel. Nice.

35:16 - Alyssa
Yeah, so on the quotes for parts, I get people to pay for the parts, for the shipping, and I've started, if the vendor has some kind of tax, then I started charging the tax on that, too.

35:27 - Chris Andrade
Real quick, how long does it usually typically take on a turnaround time for a quote to be submitted and turned around, to come back, and then prepare to get to the client? Oh, boy.

35:41 - Alyssa
A lot of the bigger companies, they will take months. Really? The bigger companies, they can take months because they have to go through some kind of process.

35:55 - Megan Howard
But, she gets them out usually the same day or the following day. week. �lee. Bye. Once we get a quote, because we have to go to the vendor, get a quote from them, which can take 24 to 48 hours for them to respond. Once we get a price, we usually get two, pick the better price or the better company, and then she sends out the quote right away with a request for payment.

36:19 - Chris Andrade
Okay, what was the, I guess I'm lost, what, you said a couple weeks or days, 48 hours, what takes months? For the customer to pay for the cart.

36:29 - Alyssa
I'm sorry?

36:31 - Chris Andrade
The months can take for the customer to pay for the part.

36:36 - Megan Howard
I see.

36:37 - Chris Andrade
So to request the quote from the manufacturer, though, that takes 48 hours.

36:44 - Megan Howard
Am I correct, Alyssa, in saying 48 hours, one to two days?

36:49 - Alyssa
Usually about 24 hours on average, but yes, so I've had a couple vendors who were busy or something, and they didn't get back to me until like a day later. Alright. my it.

36:59 - Chris Andrade
Okay. that's That's right. Okay. That makes sense. Thank you. Yeah. Okay.

37:04 - Alyssa
The quote turned around within a couple of days.

37:07 - Megan Howard
Once Kelsey says, Hey, we need this part and this part, send them a quote and collect the payment. Then it's really up to the customer at that point when they're ready to pay for the parts. And once they pay for it, she can order the part and then once we get it in, put it on the schedule and Kelsey can finish the job.

37:26 - Alyssa
And we follow up with those quotes, like after we send them to the customer, every week or week and a half, I'll send another email or text saying, Hey, are you still interested? Cool. Okay. Thank you.

37:46 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
And then just quickly on the fulfillment, when you, you said, when you create a job for like a, a part that gets ordered, if someone's just buying ink directly, let's say, how does the fulfillment happen?

37:59 - Megan Howard
Do you create shipping? That depends.

38:03 - Alyssa
Usually they, the majority of customers that we have are local. They're around the Phoenix area. So they will request delivery. We have a flat rate for delivery, so they don't have to worry about it being too much or whatever. So I put that on the delivery shelf, Joe grabs it and he goes off to do the service calls and delivers on the way. Okay. But there are a few customers who need the inks immediately or something, and in which case, yes, I will make a shipping label for that and send that off through UPS.

38:41 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Okay. So there's more turnaround. There's more time that it takes if Joe needs to deliver because he's doing other stuff, right? Exactly.

38:50 - Alyssa
The delivery depends on our availability and if we're going to be in that area. Yeah.

38:55 - Chris Andrade
And quick question, since we're on that subject. How do you guys Can geomap your delivery like on that day, right? Like you mentioned, like how does that, can you explain that while we're on that subject a little bit?

39:13 - Megan Howard
Well, there's probably two different methods, but Jobber has the ability to optimize a route. When you go into the calendar, you can hit optimize. I think that's the button and it'll give you the best route. But then at the end of the day, Kelsey will adjust it basing on where he wants to start and end his day because he can, he goes all over the valley most days. It's not like regional, like if he knows he's going to be all the way out and BFE and he has another job that week, that's also on BFE. He might try to put those on the same day, but for the most part, some of these people need something right away. So he might have to go to BFE twice that week. Cause he'll go to Prescott and Payson. And you name it for the deliveries.

40:05 - Alyssa
So if, for example, the person is in Sholo, they want paper delivered. We can't do that. Kelsey's not going to be in Sholo for the next week or so. We don't know. We don't have Sholo scheduled on our calendar. So in that case, automatically, we're defaulting to shipping it out because it's not within the Phoenix area.

40:26 - Megan Howard
And you're not shipping it from the office, correct, Alyssa? You're drop shipping it from the provider? That depends.

40:34 - Alyssa
Usually I try to drop ship from the provider. If we have it in the office and the provider maybe doesn't have that paper in stock or says it's going to take longer, then we'll ship it straight from the office. How often does that happen?

40:55 - Megan Howard
How often does what happen? Like, I, so I guess you can't.

40:59 - Chris Andrade
How I quantify that. I'm just trying to figure out.

41:03 - Megan Howard
I think she drop ships at least five or six times a month, right? Send a fee over the vendor and they mail it out. I'd say that's a pretty good average. But honestly, we can easily do that on a bigger scale, like local delivery. We have, and that's something that Kelsey has wanted to implement. But that's our wish list.

41:29 - Chris Andrade
We have a wish list that we're gathering up, you know.

41:35 - Megan Howard
It doesn't happen very often. It could happen more often so that we would have less delivery locally. But at the same time, Kelsey likes to provide that convenience where he can have it to you same day. And typically drop shipping is going to be, you know, one to two days, sometimes more. Okay.

41:58 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Okay. So that same day or next day delivery is pretty important to Kelsey.

42:06 - Alyssa
Yeah, there's some customers who have really big jobs that they're printing. They'll run out of ink. They'll call in. They're like, okay, we need some mad black ink as soon as possible. We're in Scottsdale. When's the soonest you can get some to us? Kelsey usually likes to prioritize those because usually they're pretty good customers.

42:26 - Chris Andrade
And do you think for like, how many customers do you have up in Sholo or Pinetop or, I mean, let's just say over a hundred mile radius? Oh, probably only a dozen outside of the Valley area.

42:40 - Megan Howard
A little more than a dozen at this point, maybe about 20 total.

42:44 - Chris Andrade
And then out of those 20, let's say if one, like the instance, the one is Sholo, they need paper like now and you can't get it there for three days. If they're willing to pay an expedited fee of, let's just say $300 for somebody to literally. So go run up there, drop it off, mean, that'll take roughly six hours, right? Four hours, right?

43:06 - Megan Howard
I don't think he's ever done a solo same-day drop.

43:10 - Chris Andrade
I know, I'm just saying, would the customers, do you think the customers would pay a premium price for that kind of option? No, don't know how they are, but I don't think so.

43:20 - Megan Howard
No, because they're pretty good about ordering before they run out. Like ink is something that you can't exactly plan because you can't see it. But paper is, and usually the people that order these things, they have, it's on a pretty regular basis. They know how quick they go through things that emergencies come up for sure. But typically, I'm sure if you probably said it's going to cost them 300 bucks to do it, that they'll be willing to wait a couple of days.

43:50 - Chris Andrade
All right. Awesome. Awesome. Yeah. Kelsey's calling on this phone. Darn it.

43:57 - Alyssa
I'll call him for the other one. Everyone wants to be here if you want.

44:00 - Chris Andrade
Go ahead. Let's see what kind of call, let's see what kind of call he's going to bring you. Give us some insight.

44:07 - Alyssa
Yeah, let me call him from the other phone.

44:13 - Chris Andrade
And Megan and Alyssa, while you guys are doing that, and Matthew and Trent, I know we're picking up on 15 minutes for the hour. If anybody needs to hop off, Megan, if you guys can keep going past the hour, I'm available. We can definitely schedule another meeting.

44:31 - Alyssa
And we installed Flexi on the new, the new version of Flexi and tried to test the cutter, but couldn't read the registration marks. So I'm bringing it back to the shop for further time. Alright, so installed Flexi, but the cutter could not read the registration marks, so you're bringing it back to the shop. Okay. Okay. Okay. Thank 1.5 hours today. got it. Yeah, I think you can add another hour for your in-house testing because I'm going have Joe work on. All right, adding an in-house testing. Testing in-house. And you want Joe added to this? Yeah. Okay. Do you want yourself taken off of it or do you want to keep yourself on there as well? Complete the visit for today and do another visit for tomorrow and put Joe on the visit for tomorrow. Yeah, that's what I was asking. Okay. Joe, service, tomorrow. Yeah, you don't put me on it. Okay, I did not put you on it. And let me service.
ACTION ITEM: Check Joe's Jobber notes re: Christina Coe job - WATCH: https://fathom.video/share/H-KajtCt4r9JdwzQ_NbWQ62K4HV4BqdF?timestamp=2767.9999 Okay. In-house. who's? Bye. Repair on Cutter. Save. All righty, it's all set for tomorrow. Did you get that service call? I said choose from Priscilla, or whoever that was? Yes, it's on the calendar. Joe just finished up over at Christina Coe. I don't know if he got it finished or not, but he said he figured it out. think he's going to go take care the other one, course. Okay, I'll check his notes and see about that. Okay, I'm on my way to A&M. Okay, awesome. Cool. All right. Bye. All right, there we go. That's how that usually goes. He calls in, he lets me know what happened, I update everything, and then if I need to continue the same job, I'll complete the visit that he did today. I'll put it on the calendar for tomorrow. All a fun. find whoever needs to be assigned to it, and we move forward.

47:08 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Okay, so then is that, that flow is done now? Like you're good to go on that one? No, because it's not done yet.

47:16 - Megan Howard
It's not done yet.

47:18 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Yeah, sorry, yeah, the job isn't done yet, but your, Alyssa, your input into that. For now, it is completed until I get the next update tomorrow.

47:28 - Alyssa
Got it.

47:30 - Megan Howard
And that'll happen two to four times per job. And then once it's done, she'll double check the pricing with Kelsey, and then send an invoice. Yep. Okay.

47:44 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
That was a perfect workflow there, guys.

47:46 - Chris Andrade
Good job. Yeah. I'm circling back to the fulfillment a little bit.

47:52 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Um, I know, I think I heard something about plans to have like potentially. It's online thing where Inc. you know, ordered, like customers can order it through some sort of online portal. Just wondering, Alyssa, about your thoughts on that, if you guys need it now or at what point? No, we have the website.

48:19 - Megan Howard
The website has the portal linked to it that links to Jobber. It's getting the customers to utilize it on a regular basis. And it's a training issue, training customers to do it because it's easier for them to call you with the order versus sending an online request. But it would be so much easier for everybody involved because there would be less miscommunication, less errors if they were filling out the request form, because then it goes right into the Jobber portal. It shows up on your calendar. You have to then do something with it, convert it to a job and either order the parts or grab the parts. It's up the shelf, and then put it out on the delivery shelf to be delivered. Once it gets delivered, then it gets invoiced. So the flow would work very well if people would utilize the form more frequently versus text messaging, emailing, phone calls, the whole nine.

49:19 - Alyssa
They could just order it through our website, or just send emails for the orders, like just limited to those two, that would be great.

49:28 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
So there's a lot of back and forth, it seems like, getting the details. Is there, I guess I'm wondering, I'm sorry, Chris, you can go after, but I just had this question. I was wondering, like, what's blocking, what's stopping you guys, like, why is there that request that needs to happen? Like, why don't you just have, okay, this ink cartridge is a hundred bucks purchase.

49:53 - Alyssa
Well, our website does have the inks, and it does have the prices, but there are a few people. We'll utilize it. Interesting. Okay. We tell them about it. We're always letting them know, hey, this is our website. This is our inks. You can see the prices, put them in your cart, and just, you know, online shopping and stuff. And then we get an email saying, hey, this person ordered inks. Fabulous. I through Shopify, the website.

50:20 - Megan Howard
And it'll, like, create, you know, an email with the order, and then she can take the email and plug it into Jobber.

50:29 - Alyssa
But the issue is, half the time, the customers don't exactly know what ink they actually need and will order the wrong ink. In which case, when I go onto their, our record of their company, and I see that the ink, the machine that they have does not take this ink, I have to call them. I have to see if they got a new machine or something, or if they ordered the wrong ink. And a lot of times, it's them ordering the wrong ink. So that, that, that, system's kind of. Failing from that aspect. Got it. That makes sense.

51:04 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
So that might be why they end up calling because they're just like, I want to make sure I get the right ink cartridge. Exactly.

51:11 - Alyssa
Same thing with paper. I don't know what paper my printer takes. That's a bit tougher because you can't really Google that. Yeah, you're the service provider for that. Okay. Yeah, that makes sense.

51:23 - Chris Andrade
And my question that I had to elaborate on this is, have you guys ever tried any like incentive programs or done anything to allow customers to come in? Or like, if you use this Shopify, you get entered in $100 reward or like 10% off or some, some give them something to use that to go through that funnel. Have you guys ever tried anything like that? I suspect no.

51:55 - Alyssa
Well, know we've had this plot. I think Nikki and Kelsey were trying where you can try the compatible inks for 30 days. If you don't like them, return them at no cost, basically, trying to get more people to buy the compatibles. But I guess, I don't know, the advertising didn't really work for that or something, but it didn't really work out.

52:23 - Chris Andrade
Was that something that Kelsey spun up, or who spun that up?

52:27 - Megan Howard
I think Nikki spearheaded that, and it's Kelsey's inks, but I think she created a whole separate entity and website for plotter inks to try to market the compatibles. And honestly, she's just not the best thing. She comes up with good ideas and gets things started, but doesn't follow through.

52:52 - Chris Andrade
Okay. Yeah, just was curious to like, if you guys tried, what didn't work? What did work? inexperience? 10 inks joke. I'm Remember

53:00 - Megan Howard
Go ahead, suspect very little effort went into that after everything was created. All right.

53:09 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
So just to come back to a bit of the time spent on certain tasks. So I was curious about the time spent on like manual data entry and into Jobber or just working with Jobber in general versus how much time are you on calls with Kelsey? So like in a day, do you think you might spend like an hour on the call with Kelsey total? That depends.

53:43 - Alyssa
On average, it's about maybe 10 minutes, unless it's a quick. He just wants to update, in which case it'll be about five minutes. Okay. And that's in between me entering whatever he's telling me to do on Jobber. on It's I'm Yeah.

54:01 - Megan Howard
So is that five minutes you're saying for a call? Yeah.

54:07 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Okay. So Kelsey likes to include other things in that call.

54:13 - Alyssa
I don't know if you heard most of that call earlier. was telling me just to follow up on the job that Joe was currently doing. He just finished it up. He's going to continue to the next one. Hey, did you put this other job on the calendar? He likes to bounce around and check on everything. So depending on how much he's trying to double check on, it could take longer. Got it.

54:36 - Megan Howard
So then he has the capability, just so you know, to input all of these notes on jobber itself and add the time on jobber itself. If he just spent five minutes after every job, it would be done faster than him trying to call Alyssa and explain it. And then possibly running into miscommunication along the way. Alyssa, real quick, do you ever use your dictating feature on your computer?

55:08 - Chris Andrade
Do you like using, like, voice-to-text type applications that you use it on?

55:15 - Alyssa
Not for official work stuff, because a lot of times that voice-to-text thing will mishear, and it jumbles words. Or if you're saying a name, and it sounds like, I don't know, a place or something, then it'll default to what it thinks it is. And that's the issue I have usually when Kelsey does it, when he's using it. Some sentence just makes no sense, and I have to call him up and ask him, what is this? And he's like, I don't know what that is. So I have to read what he messaged earlier, and he's like, oh, okay, so that's talking about, I don't know, the print head, and not the paper towels. And what about your computer?

55:58 - Chris Andrade
Have you ever used it on a computer at all? . . What about the computer? Okay, have you ever tried to dictate to your computer? No, my computer has no sound. Okay, perfect.

56:09 - Alyssa
Thank you. Okay.

56:15 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Did we, I don't know if we touched on how much, so how much time are you spending per day, do you think, working in jobber itself? That's pretty much my entire day.

56:29 - Alyssa
The whole time, jobber is the main thing. I'm always looking back at it. If I'm, I might be in QuickBooks getting an order figured out or a PO, but I'm always looking back at jobber, searching for my notes on there, sometimes the sticky notes. If I'm in the emails, of course, everything that's in the emails, if it's important, it goes into jobber. But everything ties back to jobber, so I'm pretty much on that entire day. Okay.

56:58 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Got it. Thank you. All

57:03 - Chris Andrade
What would make your jobber process easier?

57:13 - Alyssa
Well, there's a lot that could be better with jobber itself. Like for example, if I put a service on a specific address and the client does not tell us, hey, yeah, we have a second address now. And they give us that second address, but the job's already half completed on the first address. I can't just take that address and move it over to the other, take that job and move it on to the other address, for example. It's stuck on that one address.

57:46 - Megan Howard
She would have to add the address and job or the second one and then redo the job on the correct address. Yes. They'd have to delete the entire job and move all the notes and move all the pictures.

57:59 - Alyssa
. I mean, I guess it's kind of our fault for not asking, but a lot of people don't move often or get secondary locations very often. So unless they straight up tell us, we don't know. Well, I just want to respect everybody's time here. We are approaching on the hour.

58:20 - Megan Howard
We still kind of got a lot to go through.

58:24 - Chris Andrade
We're like, we're kind of halfway there to our list. Is everybody okay moving forward? And if you need to stop by all means. I have more time except Alyssa.

58:38 - Megan Howard
Yeah, that's fine.

58:38 - Chris Andrade
We can keep going.

58:40 - Alyssa
Awesome. Thank you so much.

58:41 - Chris Andrade
I love the trooper mentality. Let's keep it going. Awesome. So when you are, hey, Trent, are you there? Can you ask, like, you had a really good way to elaborate on the handoff. much. Um, can you ask that question? Yeah, sure.

59:04 - Trent Christopher
Um, I think at one point in time, Kelsey was explaining to us that there are times that he's updating, he's updating Alyssa on a job. And sometimes he's calling or texting in between a job, like maybe when he's driving or when he's moving to the next location, or sometimes maybe there's a client that calls Kelsey, and then he needs to somehow link that him, or sorry, link that client to Alyssa. And he'll, yeah, he'll just call me and he'll just merge the calls.

59:37 - Alyssa
Yeah, he'll merge the call.

59:38 - Trent Christopher
And then he just leaves the phone like sitting there while you guys have your chat, right?

59:42 - Alyssa
And then we hear the lovely sounds of Kelsey talking with the customer and the distance as we're trying to communicate what kind of problem the person who I'm talking to on his phone.

59:53 - Trent Christopher
And you can't, and you can't mute Kelsey. So, yeah, that's a chance. I don't Is there any other weird scenarios that are similar to that, the way he likes to communicate? It sounds like it's kind of a mixed bag.

1:00:12 - Alyssa
So one of the fun scenarios that happens every now and then is he's talking with me. We're trying to get a job figured out. I'm trying to get details to get all the notes incorrectly. And then he gets a call. He's like, hold on one second. That one second turns into like 15 minutes. And then he hangs up because he forgot that I'm on hold on the other line and we're still working on a job. So then I have to call him back and he's like, Oh, shoot. Sorry. Yeah. What were we doing again? Yep. Yeah, I can see that.

1:00:45 - Trent Christopher
You know, I have noticed that Kelsey likes to talk and he'll go off on tangents and it's fine. But I can see how, you know, his thought process being disrupted by another task can go on for a minute. And then I forgot, forgot what he was doing.

1:01:00 - Chris Andrade
In one week, Alyssa, how much time do you think that takes? Like, if you can just quantify it, it doesn't need to be accurate.

1:01:07 - Alyssa
Just give me a rough idea.

1:01:10 - Chris Andrade
How much it takes to do what?

1:01:12 - Trent Christopher
Like, how many times or how much time do you think you might be burning up by having these handoff situations?

1:01:23 - Alyssa
Like per day? Any way you want to quantify it, it's fine.

1:01:26 - Trent Christopher
It's just that we're ballparking this. Uh, let's see.

1:01:31 - Alyssa
I usually jump around pretty quickly. So, maybe I lose about 10 minutes of time, just as a maximum. For each time or each day or? Uh, every time it happens and it happens maybe once every few weeks. Okay.

1:01:53 - Trent Christopher
I like to think I'm pretty quick on it.

1:01:55 - Alyssa
I don't think it really knocks me back very much. okay. Okay, Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Thank Okay. It's just inconvenient.

1:02:05 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
I was kind of wondering about with the whole idea of Kelsey could update Jobber with certain updates. Do we know insight as to why he doesn't? Because he could type them in on his phone, right? Yes. We know he doesn't like the dictation, or he doesn't seem to like the outputs, or both of you don't, because it's like, it will misunderstand words, and probably, especially printer-related jargon, it would get wrong, right? Yeah.

1:02:41 - Alyssa
It always does. Yeah.

1:02:43 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
So I guess I'm wondering, like, why doesn't he like typing it out? He's, it takes him too long.

1:02:52 - Alyssa
He doesn't like typing it out, it just takes him too long to actually get in the keyboard, start typing it out, and he makes spelling mistakes, and then he gets frustrated with it. So he prefers to just dictate it. Got it. Okay.

1:03:05 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Yeah, because he's on the move. He's using his hands to repair printers, not...

1:03:09 - Alyssa
Exactly. If he's driving, he also likes to dictate rather than text because he wants to keep things moving.

1:03:16 - Megan Howard
Have you tried using versus voice transcription through text?

1:03:21 - Chris Andrade
Have you guys ever just tried, instead of just texting, why not just send you like an audio file that you can do? You said you can just put that audio, record, and send it. Have you guys ever tried that? He's left voicemail before.

1:03:35 - Megan Howard
And how did you like that?

1:03:39 - Alyssa
No, he likes things done now. No, no.

1:03:43 - Chris Andrade
How did you like the voicemail aspect?

1:03:46 - Alyssa
It's not very clear.

1:03:48 - Chris Andrade
Because he's not clear. He's not concise.

1:03:51 - Megan Howard
He... It's not always just like, do this, do that, do this, do that. It's like he wants to tell you a story about what he just did. Or he doesn't... He didn't give me enough information.

1:04:01 - Alyssa
He's like, oh, hey, so some guy just called me. I think he's from this company. He needs work on his printer. Can you get that set up? And he doesn't give any more information. And then, of course, I have to call him or text him and say, hey, what kind of printer is it? What kind of work does it need? Or I can reach out to the client if I can figure out who he said it was from. But half the time, he's like, I think they're from this company.

1:04:26 - Chris Andrade
If there was a way that we can just, yes, give Kelsey somewhere to kind of do what he does and how he talks, right? Everybody's different, right? We just have to adopt to Kelsey, unfortunately, or fortunately, but if we gave him a way to like summarize, ultimately, what he's trying to say. Would that be helpful and then kind of standardize what and then eventually he would understand that if he needs to kind of say things in a particular way?

1:05:01 - Megan Howard
I have tried training Kelsey for at least six months to a year on how to give you just the down and dirty. This is the customer's name. Here's the phone number. This is what he said. Call so and so to get the info or just like bullet point. And I don't know if you've ever seen one of his voice texts, but they're just, it's a big, long ramble. Got it. Yeah.

1:05:32 - Alyssa
Sometimes he just screenshots an image of his text with the customer. All I see is that this guy's name is like Dan and we have like 10 Dans in the system. I don't see their phone number. I don't see what company they're from. They're asking for service on a T2500 and it's got a jam. So I have that information, but I don't know who this Dan is. have like five Dans. We don't have the company. I can't find the phone number. So it does not help.

1:06:00 - Megan Howard
Honestly, him being involved in the communication at all is where all of this back and forth and breakdown happens. Like he's suggested he'll give up his personal number and make it the business number and get a new phone number for his personal, which would be helpful. But his main concern is he, for some reason, seems to think that the phone isn't getting answered fast enough or text message back fast enough. And he wants to see what what calls are coming through and he wants to micromanage and then not micromanage. Yes, he wants to be involved, but not involved.

1:06:44 - Trent Christopher
So, so what would do you think instead of him seeing the calls actively coming in and then being answered?

1:06:56 - Alyssa
Is there something that he could see?

1:07:00 - Megan Howard
Well, he can look at his job or schedule, because if somebody called in, he's going to put it right on the schedule right then and there. Yep. It might be tomorrow.

1:07:09 - Alyssa
It might be today. Usually I like to put things for tomorrow so that I'm not filling up today because he's already got a lot going on today. So if he just looks on his calendar, tomorrow's schedule, he'll be able to see all the stuff that came in today. It needs to move out later on throughout his calendar.

1:07:26 - Megan Howard
But that's what causes all of his stress is because instead of utilizing the tools that are available to him to see what's going on, he just panics and thinks that they're not done. And I call him at the end of the day.

1:07:44 - Alyssa
Sorry. I call him at the end of the day to go over the calendar, letting him know, hey, so this person ordered this, this person called in for a service. So I am going over and informing him of what happened.

1:07:55 - Megan Howard
Is he still doing his daily calls? Which daily calls are we talking about?

1:08:01 - Alyssa
At the end of the day. I'm trying to keep that up. There's been more than enough days when he said, you know what, we'll talk about this tomorrow. I'm tired. Let's go for this in morning. Let's go for this in the morning. So we had to push it off to the morning.

1:08:14 - Chris Andrade
And how often does that forget to happen, follow up on the morning?

1:08:21 - Alyssa
No, because I'm calling him in the morning. I'm telling him, hey, listen, we need to figure this out. So in the morning, it absolutely happens because I need to know what's going on. Good job. Good job.

1:08:32 - Chris Andrade
Yeah.

1:08:33 - Megan Howard
But he gets he likes to be at work at like six in the morning before everybody gets there. Yeah. instead of just looking at his calendar for the next two days to see what happened, he starts stressing out because he has no idea what happened the day before. He didn't organize the schedule the way he wanted it the night before. And that's usually what starts him off in a spiral or in a bad mood. Okay. Okay. Well,

1:09:00 - Alyssa
Especially if there's a lot of jobs, like anything over five jobs that are on him that he has to go out and do service for that one day, he gets really stressed about. And usually we can push one or two off. It's just a matter of prioritizing. That's why I try to call him the evening after work, at the end of the day, work day, sorry, to go over everything so that we can plan ahead so that when he wakes up in the morning at 6am when nobody else is awake, Um, he can look at a schedule and not stress.

1:09:33 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
So he's heavily involved in the prioritization process right now. The service calls?

1:09:39 - Alyssa
Yes, absolutely. How does he make the decisions on what to prioritize?

1:09:45 - Trent Christopher
Is it based on like distance or the service that's happening?

1:09:51 - Alyssa
First off, it's the customer's need for it. Second off, it's the distance.

1:10:02 - Megan Howard
And I guess thirdly is what kind of parts may be involved, and if we have them in stock.

1:10:07 - Alyssa
So there is kind of a process that I've noticed with him.

1:10:11 - Trent Christopher
But it's pretty obvious that the number one thing he looks at is the urgency in the client's perspective. Yes.

1:10:20 - Alyssa
Got it.

1:10:28 - Trent Christopher
And what part of having like five of them scheduled, like you mentioned, that doesn't have to exactly five, but is frustrating to him? Is it that it's not in order of the prioritization he would think? Or is it because there's just so many of them?

1:10:43 - Alyssa
Because it's so many and each service call can take up to two to three hours if it's something serious. Got could take up his entire day plus plus. So he's been, when he's had like that many. right right side. And side Thank He has been out trying to fix these printers until maybe, like, I think the latest was around 7-8pm was when he finally finished. So yeah, it's a full day of work. Sometimes he has skipped lunch before to try and get these calls done.

1:11:22 - Chris Andrade
So what's his preference on that, you know?

1:11:25 - Trent Christopher
Like, what do you say?

1:11:26 - Alyssa
I find that if he has three to four jobs a day for the service calls, that's, that's perfect. That works out just fine. If it's less, even better.

1:11:40 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
So I wonder if, like, maybe the daily meeting, like, if there's five on the schedule for the next day, then is that a time when you could, like, emphasize urgency for the, for that meeting? Is that something you do? So, yes, I call him and I try to get him to talk.

1:12:03 - Alyssa
If he's, if it's the end of the day, he's had a hard day and he's tired, he tells me, yeah, we'll do this in the morning, we'll do this in the morning. Even though he has five things on schedule, he just puts it off to the morning if he's had a rough day. But otherwise, usually he picks up and I ask him, hey, is this, this is what you've got going on tomorrow? Is this happening? Is this happening? This is just a follow up. So you don't have to worry about that. But is this job happening? Should I put this job off since it doesn't look like it's a priority from my end? And he just lets me know. Okay.

1:12:38 - Trent Christopher
How is he deciding on what's happening and what's not happening? Is it really based on what we just talked about with urgency and Yes, it's based on what he talked with the client about or we usually know a lot of the customers that we have.

1:12:53 - Alyssa
I know that if it's a new customer, he tends to prioritize those as well. Like a brand, brand new customer. We've never worked with them before. Obviously, we want them to continue coming back to us. He puts those at the top. Okay.

1:13:10 - Trent Christopher
So does he, do the clients see the schedules the day before somehow? Like, do they know that they're, they have a scheduled appointment for the next day? Or is that just internal until he shows up or he calls ahead of time? Usually he tells them.

1:13:31 - Alyssa
Hey, I'll be out there tomorrow. Or, Hey, I'll be out there later in the week. I'll let you know.

1:13:36 - Megan Howard
Because usually he's involved right now in getting the call, getting the thing on the schedule. Like he's, he got a call from so-and-so. He called Alyssa and told her to put it on there. They're having this paper jam, put it on the schedule for tomorrow. And I have tried to take that off his shoulders.

1:13:55 - Alyssa
I have tried to schedule it for him. experience. And, you he's doesn't like that, because then it's not how he wants it. Like, somebody will call, they're like, okay, I need this printer, we need to get back printing as soon as possible. Okay, the earliest time I have is tomorrow morning. Does that sound good? Customer's like, oh yeah, absolutely, tomorrow morning. I'm like, perfect, okay, I put it on Kelsey's schedule for tomorrow morning. We go over it with Kelsey at the end of the day or the next day, and he's like, what? I can't do that tomorrow. I want to do this tomorrow. So he's prioritizing something else. And I didn't know about that until we started going over the schedule with him. Got it.

1:14:38 - Trent Christopher
So he might have something in his head that he wants to do that ends up getting in conflict with something that you put on the schedule. Exactly.

1:14:47 - Alyssa
So I don't prioritize anything. Customer calls, hey, I need this printer fixed as soon as possible. Okay, we'll try to get out there as soon as possible. Let me see when we can do that. I'll give you an update. And then I contact. He'll see and say, Hey, so this person's printer is down. They need it fixed as soon as possible. When can you get out there? I can't put it on the calendar myself because I need to check in with Kelsey because he might have something else that he's prioritizing. Yeah.

1:15:11 - Trent Christopher
So it sounds like, you know, if he had the ability to see a list or had a list of the things and he had the ability to put the things on the calendar he wanted at the time he wanted, however he wanted, it would be beneficial. But the problem with that is that now the response time to the client is compromised. Right? Yeah. And he does have that ability. He has the calendar in his hand.

1:15:39 - Alyssa
The app lets him move things around. It lets him see his entire day, all the services. He can change it, move it, update it.

1:15:48 - Megan Howard
Um, he's just, he doesn't, he doesn't like doing it a himself. Um, he can, and he does, he does do some of it. I would say at least five to 10% of it. And he said, hey.

1:15:59 - Alyssa
he's himself.

1:16:01 - Megan Howard
Um, but he just prefers calling and telling you to do it. Yeah.

1:16:09 - Trent Christopher
Does he see the schedule and then call you to ask you to change it or? Yes.

1:16:14 - Alyssa
He also does that. That's, uh, usually happens at the end of the day when we're going over the schedule. And he's like, Hey, what's this call right here? And I'm like, yeah, that they called in for a service and this is what's going on. When do you want to move that to? Okay.

1:16:35 - Megan Howard
Yeah. Yeah.

1:16:39 - Alyssa
Very manual.

1:16:40 - Megan Howard
And depending on his mood, depending on his thing, like it, it's nothing that we can just automate for him. Yeah.

1:16:50 - Trent Christopher
It sounds like, you know, he has many modes of communication, like texting and calling, but it seems like that. calling is one of those primary ways of communicating. And asking somebody to do something for him. Um, does it require a lot of back and forth communication with him? Like you have to ask questions to be able to get what you need or does he, is he capable of almost telling you what he needs in like, you know, one statement or sentence? Yeah, he's capable of that.

1:17:20 - Alyssa
He can do that. He calls me, he'll give me the full information. If I need additional info, I'll ask him. Like if he doesn't tell me what address that this is for. Uh, this is, I'll ask him, is this for the Mesa address or the Phoenix address? He'll let me know. Mesa. Great. Okay. Yeah. So we, it just feels like, uh, you know, we got to adopt his style, which his style is kind of mixed.

1:17:45 - Trent Christopher
So yeah. Yeah, his style is very mixed. He prefers calls.

1:17:48 - Alyssa
He prefers texts. Those are his top two. He doesn't like checking emails. I have to keep an eye on all the emails. If there's something that pops in there for him, I need to let him know about it. Um, Yeah. Yeah, he's been pretty good at the jobber texts. That jobber text system is nice.

1:18:04 - Trent Christopher
That's one of the things he really likes about jobber and that all attaches to the, uh, client in the not really.

1:18:14 - Megan Howard
No, it stays in one message area, but you can only message the mobile number that's in jobber with that client. Like you can't just start a new chat.

1:18:31 - Alyssa
So why does he like that one?

1:18:34 - Megan Howard
Because then it's not clogging up his text message on his phone. Oh, got it. And it's all centralized. And then Alyssa can also see the same texts at the same time because she can see it from her computer. Okay. He doesn't, he gets overwhelmed when he's getting phone calls and text messages on his phone because, uh, he gets a lot more than Alyssa does. Okay. And he feels obligated to stop what he's doing, whether he's driving, working, whatever he's doing, he feels obligated to stop what he's doing and handle it.
ACTION ITEM: Log into Plotter Mechanics Jobber; review Messaging/Client Portal - WATCH: https://fathom.video/share/H-KajtCt4r9JdwzQ_NbWQ62K4HV4BqdF?timestamp=4742.9999

1:19:13 - Trent Christopher
I'll have to look in the jobber a little bit more because I'm in it right now and I don't really see where the messaging features are. It's on the top right corner.

1:19:23 - Megan Howard
There's a little message box. It looks like a little text message.

1:19:28 - Alyssa
Interesting. I don't have that on the line.

1:19:32 - Trent Christopher
I'm on a trial plan, so it might just be because I'm...

1:19:36 - Megan Howard
Yeah, it's in the full-blown... He said he gave you guys access to a jobber account.

1:19:42 - Trent Christopher
Yeah, I didn't want to mess with his account right now. I was doing some testing on some integrations to fully understand exactly how it would work and function, but I didn't want to mess with your guys' instance. It's right here. Yeah, if I have access to it, I can log into it.

1:20:00 - Alyssa
Okay, it's right there.

1:20:01 - Trent Christopher
Okay. Yeah, my trial that I'm using as a demo does not have that. So, okay. Okay, so that's, that's nice that it does keep it separate. think he just likes that his business communications, his client communications are all in one spot, right? We hope, but they're everywhere.

1:20:22 - Alyssa
Yeah. Yeah.

1:20:24 - Trent Christopher
guess like that's why he likes the Jobber message app, even though it's still scattered across his phone and text us on his phone and phone calls. And yeah, I get it. I get it.

1:20:37 - Megan Howard
And he likes that because once we schedule a job, he wants you to communicate with them through Jobber text telling them you've been scheduled. And technically Jobber has a client portal. So that would be another area where we can improve client communication, because then they can log in and see on their end. When the job is scheduled for, like, there's a spot for jobs, like upcoming jobs, completed jobs, and then invoices that are open, and it shows you all the ones that have been paid as well. Yeah.

1:21:14 - Trent Christopher
It looks like there's also, like, an automation that you can set up that, like, when a client gets a scheduled visit or job, it can potentially automatically message them.

1:21:25 - Megan Howard
Yes, it can, but he doesn't like that teacher.

1:21:27 - Trent Christopher
Because it tells them before he decides to change it. Exactly. Yeah. So it needs to send it, like, you know, at some point whenever he's committed, right?

1:21:39 - Megan Howard
And he does, like, sometimes he'll text him, like, because there's an automated option to say, I'm on my way. So he'll send him a text when he's on his way. Yeah. Yeah, like that. Joe used that option a lot, which is really nice.

1:21:52 - Alyssa
Yeah. Because I can actually see that Joe just messaged this client. He's going to be there in about 15 or 20 minutes. And I'm like... Oh, cool. Okay. How's that show up on your end?

1:22:03 - Trent Christopher
How do you see that? Oh, here, let me use the camera again.

1:22:08 - Alyssa
Alright, cool. Let's see if you can see my screen. How do I flip this thing? Oh, wait. Aha! Look at that.

1:22:26 - Megan Howard
So, for example, right here, I've got two messages that I haven't read.

1:22:32 - Alyssa
So, where's the red dot? There's usually a red dot. Where'd it go? Oh, there it And this one says, uh-huh. So, Juara's contracting, and... Hello, this is Plotter Mechanics. We will arrive in approximately 15 minutes. And I'm like, okay, cool. So, I know Joe is on his way to Juara's contracting. And they saw it because... It says that they liked it. Got it.

1:23:02 - Trent Christopher
Okay, so yeah, that's a neat little feature there. I like it.

1:23:05 - Megan Howard
And you could also, if she read it and she wants it to be not read, she can mark it as unread so it stays with a red dot for everybody to see it. Yeah, to come back to it.

1:23:16 - Alyssa
So I can go in here and I can mark as unread so that everybody can see that this conversation has not been read even though I've already read it. If it's not pertaining to something that I'm doing, I can just unread it.

1:23:29 - Trent Christopher
Yeah, so is it easy to take a message and turn it into like a request or a quote or a job or anything like that? If all the information is available.

1:23:42 - Alyssa
I'm sorry, what's that?

1:23:45 - Megan Howard
I don't think it has an automatic feature where you could just say, here, take this message and turn it into a job. Got it. She would just more or less have to copy paste to create the job.

1:23:55 - Alyssa
Got it. And then as that, I'm just curious about that.

1:24:00 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Is that goes out with that one? Which, which number is that?

1:24:05 - Megan Howard
It's a jobber assigned number that when you set up jobber, you got to pick a phone number for the business and it's texting only. It doesn't have a phone call capability.

1:24:19 - Trent Christopher
But you have a phone number in jobber that they, that clients can call. Is that true?

1:24:26 - Megan Howard
That would just be the office number or there's quite a few numbers, honestly. He has the Vonage number and then Alyssa has an office iPhone. Got it.

1:24:39 - Alyssa
There was a point in time when we tried getting people to call the office iPhone because that's basically the office phone. It did not work out great, but you know, we do get calls. So some people at least know.

1:24:57 - Trent Christopher
We know that people call. Kelsey's phone often, but where does the next level of communications come from? are the next most amount of communications? Is it through the jobber?

1:25:14 - Alyssa
After Kelsey's phone, I'd say the next biggest amount of communication is actually through email. Oh, really? Okay. Email and jobber texts. Okay.

1:25:27 - Megan Howard
So jobber texts is really utilized for telling somebody you're on your way. We've scheduled your job. Follow up on invoicing because you can text an invoice to them. Okay. We can send pictures now.

1:25:46 - Alyssa
Okay.

1:25:49 - Megan Howard
So it's not utilized except for like, keeping in contact once there's been a schedule, but they probably called Kelsey. Or sent in email, and very rarely, probably call the office phone. So calling the office phone is probably like last on the list.

1:26:10 - Alyssa
Next to Shopify orders.

1:26:17 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
So for email, I remember, Alyssa, how much are you involved with the email? Because I know you mentioned earlier on the call that there's like a bunch of different emails. Yes. She manages 10 inboxes.

1:26:36 - Megan Howard
Silliness. He has a sales inbox for like ordering supplies. If you want to send a supply order, he has a printing inbox to send printing requests. She manages Kelsey's box, her box. She can see the accounting box. The service box, the supplies box, there's the design box, which we tried There's to

1:27:00 - Alyssa
Using when people wanted designs created for their printing, but we don't need that many emails.

1:27:07 - Megan Howard
It's very overwhelming. And then right now, there's a way where it's somehow repeating itself. So sometimes emails go, the same email goes into multiple boxes. That's always fun.

1:27:21 - Alyssa
Yeah.

1:27:23 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
So how is that communicated to the customers? Like, you have this email box if you want this service, for example. I think Kelsey is word of mouth.

1:27:34 - Megan Howard
He tells them if you want something printed, email printing, and send a copy of what you want printed.

1:27:41 - Alyssa
Or I tell them, like, if it's some kind of payment related thing, I'm like, okay, please send the invoice to accounting or please send that to accounting. It's also on all of our invoices at the very bottom. says, please send all inquiries to accounting. Is it helpful?

1:27:57 - Trent Christopher
Like for you, Alyssa, I know you. We don't like managing 10 email boxes, but is it helpful that you have these separated messages, the way that they come in that way?

1:28:11 - Alyssa
It keeps me from getting overwhelmed because if I'm in one inbox and I've only got like three things in there, then I can ignore the 10 things on the other inbox for a while until I get through that. And then I can switch gears, go to the...

1:28:26 - Chris Andrade
So I'm just going to jump in here for a second because I ultimately know Plot of Mechanics because I was a customer, right? Not only did we buy a plot printer because Kelsey was responsive, he was the only one who responded on Facebook, right? But then when we saw what he was capable of, I needed prints done. When he designed the vinyl, he printed out the stickers are all over advertisement. What happened as a user, as a customer, it was confusing because... I would send, I think this was when Mike or somebody was handling the artwork, the Adobe Illustrator, yeah. So then I would send Mike an email, and then I would never get a response back, so then I would call, and he'd be like, oh yeah, okay, I'll get on that. Or if I didn't get a hold of on that and there was a timeline, I would reach out to Kelsey, and then he'd be like, oh, let me tell Mike. Or Mike would say, oh, I went to the wrong email, so.

1:29:33 - Megan Howard
Yeah, and that's one of the main reasons why Mike is no longer employed, because his lack of response, follow-up, follow-through, just was subpar, and it was more stressful than helpful. And Alyssa has since picked up most of Mike's tasks, and I think Joe is doing some of them. Yeah, Joe's basically taken over Mike's tasks.

1:29:59 - Alyssa
But even one When I was here working with Mike in the same office, and I'd have to constantly remind him about stuff like, hey, did you get this done? And he's like, oh, oh, yeah, I forgot about that. Yeah, I'll do it in a minute. Two hours later, hey, did you get this done yet? Oh, oh, yeah, I forgot about that. was just working on that.

1:30:19 - Chris Andrade
In your experience, is it worth the effort? Like, I guess, is the profit margins, or do we know if the profit margins are better on the print services that you guys offer?

1:30:31 - Megan Howard
No, they're not, and they're barely breaking even. It's mostly because it's not being priced accordingly. The other reason was probably because Kelsey's trying to do everybody a favor by giving them discounted work. So it, if I had to guess, it's paying for itself, but we're not making a profit, and sometimes losing. And I brought that up to him as, maybe. Thank much. We don't need to necessarily continue, but it's one way he can get his machines regularly working because if you don't run those machines, they often break down or have more issues or ink dries up, so there's a slight purpose to it, but it has, before we brought on Joe, it has been a pain point where we were wasting a lot of money because Mike would have to redo things multiple times, and he wasn't charging the right prices, nor was he keeping track of the materials he was wasting, and yeah, it's not a good problem.

1:31:42 - Chris Andrade
Do type of, like, way to calculate your price per square foot on, I guess, in prints, because I remember when I reprinted out a 16-foot banner, right, it was 16 feet long, and I remember when we had to print that banner, a very I'm we're we There was, like, maybe four or five conversations just to get a price, right? I guess we can talk to Kelsey, but is there any ideas of how a pricing calculator would work? remind you, we have a hard stop in 10 minutes.

1:32:19 - Megan Howard
Well, we have, it's programmed into the computer pricing that in Jobber. Um, like, if you pick vinyl, like, you have to pick the material, you have to pick the size and all the stuff. There's, like, a price point on there, but it's not what he's charging. Like, if you went to an actual professional printer, they would charge you three or four times what Kelsey's charging for it. Got it. Got it. Yep. And yeah, okay.

1:32:50 - Alyssa
Yeah.

1:32:51 - Chris Andrade
And honestly, listen, guys, we've been here for we still got so much to go over and we have another meeting that we have to get ready for. So I think just to respect everybody's time here, we've been at it for an hour and a half consistently, and we greatly appreciate it. Like, we have uncovered so much, and we still have so much more to go. I think we can bat enough now for Miss Alyssa to kind of enjoy her time away. When you come back, we will have another round.

1:33:25 - Alyssa
Would that be okay? It works for me.

I do encourage you while you are on your vacation, and you like, you start to see what we're trying to talk about. Maybe, like me personally, I love to journal. I like to write. And when I noticed that when I get in my journal mode, or my relaxed mode, and I just, you know, sometimes things just pop up. We are looking on how we can make you more efficient or better. And then that produces more profit for quantum mechanics, right? So if there's any other insights or things that you think, man, if there's a way to turn this switch on, it would help Kelsey and us so much. And I encourage you to kind of like explore those type of thoughts, like turn that on in your brain a little bit and then just see what that looks like. No idea is dumb, right? And you can even, you got my number, just you don't even have to text it, like send me an audio recording of, hey, I was just thinking about that. This, and this, and this, and just send me an audio recording. could be 20 minutes. could be whatever. Like the more information you give us, the better we are at the end of the day.

1:34:42 - Megan Howard
If you can try to find those procedures, Alyssa, that we've created. Yeah. Thank you for that, Megan. Thank you.

1:34:49 - Chris Andrade
Yes, I should have them somewhere.

1:34:54 - Alyssa
You got my email.

1:34:55 - Chris Andrade
Just send them to me when you have a chance. You can always just take a picture a of it too and just text it.

1:35:01 - Megan Howard
That works as well.

1:35:04 - Chris Andrade
Yeah, if we can frame from that, I'd rather go there and we can just make copies if we have to. That would probably be a lot easier, too. So we'll figure it out, though.

1:35:14 - Megan Howard
Okay.

1:35:15 - Chris Andrade
Awesome. Again, Megan, it was so nice to meet you again. Any guys, you guys, any questions for us? Nope.

1:35:27 - Megan Howard
Nope, I don't think so.

1:35:28 - Alyssa
Trent, Matt, you guys have anything you want to end on?

1:35:31 - Chris Andrade
No, thanks so much for your time.

1:35:33 - Trent Christopher
know that, you know, this is quite lengthy, but ultimately we're really just trying to help. And the more information we have, like Chris said, the better we can help. So, thanks. Yeah.

1:35:46 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Thank you so much for being so open and letting us in and understanding that, you know, we're looking to see what's going on in the business and the operations and see what. Yeah. If there's any way how we can help. So yeah, thank you guys so much for your time.

1:36:07 - Megan Howard
Sounds good. Talk to you later, guys. Yep.

1:36:09 - Alyssa
Bye. See ya.
