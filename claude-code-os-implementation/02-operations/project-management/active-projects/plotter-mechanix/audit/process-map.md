## 📞 COMMUNICATION FLOW - The Chaos (Dec 22 Kelsey Description)

### Vonage Phone System (Current)

**Main Business Number:** 602-606-XXXX (Vonage)

**Routing Setup:**
> "The way that it works is if you call the main number, you got 4 options, 5. Service, it goes to me. Sales goes to me, supplies goes to Alyssa, Printing goes to Joe, and accounting goes to my wife." - Kelsey

```

  ↓     ↓      ↓       ↓         ↓
Kelsey Kelsey Alyssa  Joe     Wife(Nicky)
```

**Additional Numbers:**
- **Kelsey's Personal Cell:** "Most customers" call this directly
- **Alyssa's Verizon Number:** Customers have this, she calls out from it
- **Office phones:** Kelsey monitors Vonage app on phone for messages

**Problem:**
> "I don't like that missing phone call shit. I hate it, dude. I hate it when I call a place and someone doesn't answer, so I want someone to pick up or something." - Kelsey

But also:
> "I need to decide whether that's a waste of time or it's not, and not somebody else because they make the wrong decision" - Kelsey (re: wants to filter but also wants control)

### Actual Communication Flow (Kelsey's Description)

```
CUSTOMER CONTACTS
        ↓
   [Multiple Channels]
   ↙      ↓      ↓      ↓      ↘
Personal Office Jobber Email  Email
 Cell   Vonage  Text  Inboxes (Multiple)
  ↓       ↓      ↓      ↓       ↓
Kelsey Kelsey/ Kelsey/ service/
       Alyssa  Alyssa  supplies/
                       sales/etc
```

**Kelsey's Daily Routine:**
> "Monday mornings are pretty much every day actually. I sit down and I glance at my text message string, my personal one, all the way down until like several days back. And then I go into Jobber and I do the same thing, you know, and I'm like, what did we forget to do here? And then I go, if I have extra time, I go check my personal inbox and then if I have time after that, then I start checking the service and the other ones" - Kelsey

**Email Situation:**
> "206 unread messages. I hate that shit. I can't believe that it's gotten to that. Most of it's probably bullshit. I don't know because I'm seeing everybody's emails in my phone, you know, so I just, I don't really look at the warnings anymore." - Kelsey

**Email Addresses Mentioned:**
- service@plottermechanix.com
- supplies@plottermechanix.com
- sales@plottermechanix.com
- accounting@plottermechanix.com
- Kelsey@plottermechanix.com
- Alyssa@plottermechanix.com

**Kelsey's Email Strategy:**
> "I'm trying to keep it to where only customers email those email addresses, you know, like if a customer sends an email to supplies, then we could take that information and do something with it, but we're not emailing each other through those accounts anymore. Like if we need to talk to each other, we email each other and then those are just for basically the customer's communication, but my goal is to, as soon as it comes in there, get it into Jobber and delete that out of the inbox so I don't get confused and be looking at stuff that's already been started" - Kelsey

---

### Kelsey → Alyssa Handoff Process (Current State)

**Primary Method: Phone Calls + Screenshots**

> "It's mostly just me all day calling her saying, hey Alyssa, so and so, I'll take screenshots of my phone, conversation that I'm texting with them, and I'll just shoot it over to her." - Kelsey

**Detailed Process:**
> "I take screenshots of my phone, conversation that I'm texting with them, and I'll just shoot it over to her office phone that she has, my other Verizon number, and then... I try and do it like during the night or early in the morning, so I don't bother her cell phone. And then when she comes in, she, she's getting bombarded with like the inbox, all the text messages I sent her" - Kelsey

**The Problem:**
> "I have to wait for Alyssa, right? And I, I can do it myself, but it just, it gets, if I don't let her be involved in it, and she doesn't know what happened, and then duplicating things and stuff. So like, I try and like wait for her for anything that needs to happen in regards to my day so that she can do it, not because I don't know how, but if I don't like communicate with her, then she doesn't understand what's happening." - Kelsey

**Communication Dependency:**
> "I stop Every time I get done in the car and I'm really trying to get Joe to do the same thing whether like, Joe, when you get done with your job, you need to call Alyssa and figure out where we're at" - Kelsey

**Memory Issues:**
> "I don't have a lot of memory retention. So like if somebody if I'm doing this and then this guy calls me and then I call her and then she doesn't answer. By the time I get done being pissed, she didn't answer. I already forgot what the other dude called me about. And now I'm like going back in my call log like who did I speak to? I don't know." - Kelsey

## 📋 JOBBER WORKFLOW - Intended vs Actual (Dec 22 Analysis)

### Jobber Intended Workflow:
```
REQUEST → QUOTE → JOB → VISIT → INVOICE
```

**Request:**
- Inbox of all things that need handling
- Created from: Phone calls, form submissions, texts
- Status: Needs action/review

**Quote:**
- Estimation of services
- Pricing provided to customer
- Awaiting approval

**Job:**
- Paid/approved work
- Scheduled service
- Assigned to technician

**Visit:**
- Specific appointment within a job
- On-site service delivery
- Linked to parent job

**Invoice:**
- Billing for completed work
- Payment collection
- Sent to customer

---

### Plotter Mechanix Current Workflow:

```
PHONE CALL → ??? → JOB/VISIT → INVOICE
```

**Problems Identified (Dec 22 Team Meeting):**

1. **Not Using Requests**
   - Quote from meeting: "Right now they're not even using requests"
   - Quote from meeting: "They're bypassing one of the key components, which is requests"
   - Jumping straight to Jobs/Visits
   - Missing the "inbox" concept

2. **Job vs Visit Confusion**
   - Quote from meeting: "They had an issue with was if you didn't have a job, but you did a visit, you could link it back to the person, but it wasn't attached to the job"
   - Trying to do visits before jobs exist
   - Workflow: "Why do you need to have an official paid for job before doing a visit?"

3. **Current Reality:**
   ```
   Phone call → Kelsey decides to visit → Creates Visit (not Request)
   But visit should be: Request → Maybe Quote → Job → Visit
   ```

**Team Analysis:**
> "I think that the way they're so in the weeds on their service fulfillment that if we just take the time to see what Jobber offers, like we might be able to improve their workflow just by being like, here's a Loom video, here's the training of how it could be done" - Matthew

> "The way it's intended to and the way they're using it, I don't think is lining up" - Mekaiel

> "I think that we could probably improve their workflow just by understanding how the tool is intended to be used, and just put some structure around it" - Trent

---

### Recommended Jobber Workflow:

```
INCOMING COMMUNICATION
        ↓
[Create REQUEST in Jobber] ← Quo auto-creates this
        ↓
[Triage: New or Existing Client?]
   ↙ New              Existing ↘
Qualify          Check History
   ↓                    ↓
[Create QUOTE if needed]
        ↓
[Customer Approves]
        ↓
[Convert to JOB]
        ↓
[Schedule VISIT]
        ↓
[Complete Service]
        ↓
[Generate INVOICE]
        ↓
[Collect Payment]
```

**Benefits of Proper Request Use:**
1. **Inbox concept** - Nothing falls through cracks
2. **Triage capability** - Alyssa can review and route
3. **Quo integration** - Auto-creates requests from calls
4. **Clear workflow** - Request → Quote → Job → Visit → Invoice
5. **Status tracking** - Everything has a place

## 📱 COMMUNICATION ROUTING - Current vs Needed

### Current State (Dec 22 Insights):

**Kelsey's Personal Cell is Main Business Number**
- Quote from meeting: "Kelsey's personal cell is the main business number (not Vonage business line)"
- No filtering whatsoever
- All calls go to Kelsey
- High-value and low-value mixed

**Problem:**
> "Kelsey can't not answer calls... a bunch of them are bullshit, but a bunch of them are Requests for the business, but they're just such small things" - Matthew

**Examples of Low-Value Calls:**
- "Do you sell paper?" (mentioned in meeting)
- Status check calls
- Simple FAQs
- Scheduling that Alyssa could handle

**High-Value Calls:**
- New printer sales opportunities
- Complex technical diagnosis
- High-dollar service requests

---

### Needed: Intelligent Call Routing

```
INCOMING CALL
      ↓
[Quo/Jobber Receptionist Screens]
      ↓
[AI Analyzes Intent]
   ↙        ↓        ↘
FAQ     Standard    High-Value
 ↓         ↓           ↓
Auto    Route to    Route to
Answer   Alyssa      Kelsey
 ↓         ↓           ↓
Log to  Create      Create
Request Request     Request
        +           + Flag
      Assign      URGENT
```

**Routing Logic to Define:**
- What makes a call "high-value"?
- What FAQs can be auto-answered?
- When does Alyssa handle vs Kelsey?
- Emergency bypass rules?

## 🔄 JOBBER DATA FLOW - Integration Considerations

### Quo → Jobber (One-Way)

**What Syncs Automatically:**
- Call summaries and transcripts
- Auto-create clients (unknown callers)
- Auto-create requests
- Click-to-call capability

**Limitations Identified (Dec 22):**
- Quote from meeting: "Client information updated in Jobber doesn't sync back to Quo. This is a one-way street"
- Quo doesn't know latest Jobber updates
- Can't reference existing notes from Quo
- Future: Bidirectional sync promised but not yet available

**Concerns:**
> "Will Quo-Jobber sync create too much clutter?" - Team discussion
> "Is it gonna clutter and cause more overwhelm in Jobber?" - Trent

**Data Management Needs:**
- Monitor automatic client creation for accuracy
- Regular cleanup of placeholder client records
- SOP for reviewing auto-created requests
- Ensure summaries are actionable, not just raw dumps

---

## 📊 CURRENT JOBBER USAGE STATS (Dec 22)

**From Client Account:**
- 1,562 jobs
- 1,570 clients
- 136 quotes/requests (barely used)
- Cost: $379/mo (Teams plan, Grow tier)

**Team Observation:**
> "They're paying $379 a month for Jobber... We talked about maybe we don't even use N8N and we can get a huge amount of value just by refining their process" - Trent & Matthew

**Potential Quick Win:**
Improve Jobber utilization (50-60% underutilized) before building custom automation.

---

## 🎯 PROCESS IMPROVEMENT OPPORTUNITIES (Updated Dec 22)
