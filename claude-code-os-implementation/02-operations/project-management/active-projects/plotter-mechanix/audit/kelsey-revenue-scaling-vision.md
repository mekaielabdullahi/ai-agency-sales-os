## Kelsey's Revenue Scaling Vision

### Short-Term (2026)
> "If it goes like this throughout the rest of the year, I could see how we could double our income."
> — Kelsey, Jan 27 Operations Call

- **Goal**: Double revenue to match/exceed $1.7M peak
- **Strategy**: Build team capacity without overhead and theft problems of old company
- **Key Insight**: "The highest I ever got my old business to was like 1.7M. And I had like 7 people working with me, dude... and they were stealing from you."

### Mid-Term Vision
> "I see this business just exploding and blowing up my old one out of the water. I see that I'm gonna become Arizona's wide format premier service center and all the dealers are going to be coming to me for help."
> — Kelsey, Jan 27 Operations Call

- **Position**: Arizona's premier wide-format service center
- **Model**: Dealers/other companies come to him for support
- **Opportunity**: HP supply chain shortages creating market vacuum

### Long-Term ("Pinetop Dream")
> "Achieve the Pinetop dream of managing business from remote location"
> — Referenced in ROI documents

- **Timeline**: 5 years to $8.5M
- **Lifestyle**: Reduce hours, work remotely from Pinetop cabin
- **Focus**: Shift to ministry/mentoring while business runs itself
- **Nonprofit Plan**: Launch youth mentoring program with outdoor/faith activities

## Capacity Scaling Strategy

### Current vs. Potential
| Metric | Current | Target | Multiplier |
|--------|---------|--------|------------|
| Weekly Service Calls | 15 | 45+ | **3x** |
| Daily Calls | 3-4 | 9 | 3x |
| Techs in Field | 1-2 | 3-4 | 2-3x |
| Revenue | $850K | $1.7M+ | 2x+ |

### How to Triple Capacity
1. **Train technicians to independence**: Joe at 75% after 3 months training
2. **Build training system**: "Clone Kelsey" - video library + AI coach
3. **Tiered support structure**: Hire Joe's brother for shop operations
4. **Delegate non-service work**: Andrew handles supplies/sales
5. **Automate operations**: Phase 2 AI systems saving 30+ hrs/week

---

## Revenue Streams

### Current Mix
| Stream | Status | Notes |
|--------|--------|-------|
| Service Calls | **Primary** | $175/hr + $75 trip = ~$250/call |
| Equipment Sales | Growing | Strong revenue source |
| Supplies | Declining | Transitioning to Andrew |
| Printing | Emerging | $2K in stickers recently, LLC planned |

### Future Expansion
- **Supplies JV with Andrew**: Potential to exceed service revenue
- **Mighty Picks LLC**: Spin off printing business
- **Rental/IoT Model**: $400/month recurring per client
- **Enterprise Contracts**: Maintenance agreements (currently poorly tracked)

## Answering Your Specific Questions

### 1. Service calls Kelsey can't take per week due to capacity?

**Answer: NOT EXPLICITLY DOCUMENTED**

What we know:
- Currently at **100% capacity** handling 15 calls/week
- With proper systems, could scale to **45 calls/week** (triple)
- Inference: Missing ~30 calls/week of potential capacity = **$7,500/week opportunity** (at $250/call)

**Gap**: No direct quote about turned-away calls. Need to ask Kelsey directly.

### 2. Average service call value?

**Answer: ~$250 per call**

| Component | Amount | Source |
|-----------|--------|--------|
| Trip Charge | $75 | Jobber pricing |
| Service Labor | $175/hr | Jobber pricing |
| Average Call Duration | 1-2 hrs | Feb 12 Meeting |
| **Typical Call Value** | **$250-$350** | Calculated |

### 3. Contracts/recurring accounts lost due to manpower?

**Answer: NOT QUANTIFIED**

What we know:
> "The current lack of clarity on maintenance contract statuses and renewals causes missed opportunities and billing issues"
> — Feb 12 ROI Meeting

- Maintenance contracts exist but poorly tracked
- No system to manage renewals
- Unknown how many have lapsed or been passed on
- **Gap**: Need Nikki (bookkeeper) or Kelsey to quantify

### 4. Waitlist/backlog of work Kelsey can't get to?

**Answer: NOT EXPLICITLY DOCUMENTED**

Evidence of overflow:
- "I got so much going on in the service arena that I can't [handle supplies]"
- Uses contractor Michael Maloney for overflow service calls
- Delegated supplies/sales entirely to Andrew because "I don't have time"
- 50% of service calls could be remote but he prefers onsite

**Gap**: No documented waitlist or specific backlog numbers. Need to ask Kelsey or pull from Jobber.

## Data Gaps for Revenue Scaling Analysis

| Missing Data | Why Critical | How to Get |
|--------------|--------------|------------|
| Calls turned away/week | Quantifies lost revenue | Ask Kelsey directly |
| Waitlist/backlog count | Shows immediate opportunity | Pull from Jobber |
| Lost contracts | Revenue recovery potential | Ask Nikki |
| Average deal size by type | Prioritize high-value work | Pull from Jobber |
| Customer count | Market penetration | Pull from Jobber/CRM |

## Action Plan: Pull Jobber Data for Capacity Analysis

### Existing Resource
A Jobber data request has already been drafted:
`/plotter-mechanix/offer/phase-2/2026-01-31-to-review/to-send/06-jobber-data-request.md`

### Specific Data to Pull from Jobber

**For Backlog/Waitlist Quantification:**
1. **Open Jobs without Visits scheduled** - Jobs created but not on calendar = backlog
2. **Open Quotes pending response** - Indicates pipeline/demand
3. **Jobs marked "Waiting on Parts" or "Waiting on Customer"** - Delayed capacity

**For Capacity Constraints:**
4. **Jobs/week over last 12 months** - Volume trend (currently ~15/week)
5. **Time from Job Created to Visit Completed** - Lead time indicates capacity strain
6. **Jobs assigned to contractors (Michael Maloney)** - Overflow metric

**For Lost Revenue:**
7. **Quotes that expired/declined** - Lost opportunity value
8. **Customers with 2024 service but no 2025 service** - Churn
9. **Customers with 3+ calls/year** - Contract candidates being underserved

### Jobber Export Steps (from request doc)
1. Log into Jobber → Reports → Export Data
2. Select: Last 12 months
3. Export: Customers, Jobs, Invoices, Quotes
4. Send CSVs for analysis

### Expected Insights

| Data Point | Calculation | Answer Provides |
|------------|-------------|-----------------|
| Open jobs count | Jobs WHERE status = 'open' | Current backlog size |
| Average job age | AVG(today - job_created) WHERE status = 'open' | Backlog severity |
| Expired quotes $ | SUM(quote_value) WHERE status = 'expired' | Lost revenue |
| Contractor jobs % | COUNT(contractor_jobs) / COUNT(all_jobs) | Overflow rate |

### Note: Kelsey's Jobber Workflow Quirk

From `/plotter-mechanix/audit/kelsey-jobber-workflow.md`:
> "You can make a job But if you don't make it a visit and add a person to it in a time, then it's just an open job floating around out there"

**Implication**: Many "open jobs" in Jobber are likely backlogged work that hasn't been scheduled due to capacity constraints. This is your backlog metric.

## Summary: Kelsey's Scaling Formula

```
Current State:        $850K revenue, 100% capacity, 70+ hrs/week
                              ↓
Phase 2 Systems:      Save 30-39 hrs/week, train techs, automate operations
                              ↓
Capacity Unlock:      15 → 45 calls/week (3x), Joe at 50%+ independence
                              ↓
Revenue Double:       $1.7M+ by EOY 2026
                              ↓
Long-Term:            $8.5M in 5 years, remote work from Pinetop
```

**The path to scaling revenue is operational efficiency + team development, NOT adding more of Kelsey's personal hours.**
