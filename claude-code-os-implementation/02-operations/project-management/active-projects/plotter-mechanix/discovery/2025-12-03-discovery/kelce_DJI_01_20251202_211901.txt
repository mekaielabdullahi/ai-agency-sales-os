Yeah, that's cool.
That's good.
Good, got her?
Yeah.
Nice.
So that's actually plenty, probably more than you needed to go.
But look back here, there's where your document is right here.
So you can just cut this off.
And like it wasn't so dirty in here,
you wouldn't really have to worry about putting it
on the take-up reel.
If you're just going to take it right back off,
I just wanted to show you the process.
So now you can cut this off.
You just want to keep it back behind this deck.
You know what I mean?
Let's say cut it off right here in this groove.
That way, when you hit the gas next time,
it's already coming out.
And then swing that.
You got to turn that and make sure it's facing out
so it can come out.
Got that.
Yeah.
I have to show you my new logo, bro.
I want to make it for my brand.
Oh, yeah, that's what I look at right now.
Oh, shit, the blade thought of this thing.
I don't know where it went.
Oh, sure here.
Does that make sense?
Yeah.
Same thing with this.
You got clutches back here, too.
So you want to have that snug, too.
And you also have this clutch here on your original
when you're putting it in.
And you want to have that breaking the same thing.
Because then everything is pulling back to square
and it has to go straight.
So even if you're off by an eighth of an inch or so
when you start, it'll square itself up, dude.
Within the first few feet, or a few inches.
And you can manually put pressure on it, too.
Hey, grab that really quick.
You're the other side of that.
Sixth of your shit, too.
I'm going to give this a go.
Chris was present.
Things cool.
Oh, that's your camera.
I was talking to him a little bit.
Dude, I'm going to try to figure out a way.
Like, is there anything in job or that you hate
that you wish it would do, but it doesn't?
Probably.
Well, it starts thinking about it.
I mean, it does a lot of things that I don't even
know what it does, dude.
I mean, like, I was going to do something that you
needed to do, and it doesn't do.
Let me know.
And I can't, uh, that's the things that I'm looking for.
Those types of shit.
I want to sit down with you.
So I want to sit down with you.
And I'm done.
I'm done with people in your office.
Dude, if we need any schedule, I don't want to trip.
I'm in your business.
What'd you say?
Can you go put it in my car for me?
I don't know what you're talking about.
You have to go put it in your car for me.
What customer are you talking about?
Anyone else?
There is a man in the street.
Are there machines down?
Oh, yes.
This is constantly jamming.
Oh, yeah.
Yeah, I need to put that in my car.
Yeah.
I'll grab it for you in the morning.
That was just too low to be slow.
Let me see, you, please.
I'm not really, I'm never going to address.
You know, that's what I'm talking about.
got it. Since we're going to be removing that printer and putting this printer and I
didn't want to set it up twice so I'm just going to set it up once once I reinstall it
where it's going to be. And then you can learn about it, too.
That's my desk, but we all sit there. Yeah, Joe sits there sometimes. Hey Robin,
I got your printer loaded up in the back of my truck. I was going to put it together this
morning, but I'm just going to put it together there since we got to put it on that table
and everything. I want to make sure that it gets where it's going to go in case you
got a tippet or something. I don't want to get any dripping or something like that.
So I'm all ready to go, but I got a few things I got to do on this side of town before
I leave. So probably going to not leave here for like an hour. So I think it's 930 right
now. Is that like a phone call? Oh, that's fine. Oh, I can just leave and you can have
your meeting and I can come back. 15 minutes. Yeah. That's cool. I mean, we can step out
while you have your meeting. It's fine. I don't want to drive around with your printer
in the back of my truck all day. So I'm going to try and come there first. And I don't
know how long it's going to take. So I want to give this plenty of time. Okay. Come off
Scottsdale. Okay. Yeah, I know. This printer is heavy as hell, man. I was shocked.
So I just put it in the back of the printer. Okay. We'll figure it out. I got to bring any
guy with me too. So yeah. Okay. All right, man. Okay. Bye. Yep.
Yeah, sweet. So I was like reflecting last night. And do you know we've known each other
for almost three years? Has it been that long? Do crazy, right? I know. I'm trying to remember
like I think I was mostly working out of my house when I met you guys. Yeah. So you just
move to this shop. Okay. Like right around that same time because you sent me an address
to the old shop. That was like my Walmart or something. So this is Java. Yes. So I Joe was
walking me through that. And he said the map is a really handy feature. And so when I sit
here and look at this, I'm overbooked for today. See how it says unscheduled unscheduled, there's
a filter I can turn that off. So we have an unscheduled thing that goes to the things that
are out of town. So show unscheduled. I don't want to show that show. So how do you like
Java? I mean, I like it for this reason right here. Like this is my day. Like the way that
we use it, I've got these filters over here, right? So we each have a person and then we
have a division. So like anything that has to do with me is usually going to service. So
I can filter the schedule, but not see everything on my schedule. Like this is all that's on
my list for today of things I got to do. I got a city of Glendale. I got to install this
printer for this guy. When I pick on it, I can tell this guy, hey, I'm on my way. You
know, I just pick on this and however long the GPS tells me I hit send. And then I go
here and I punch in directions. You know, so now I know it's going to take me 50 minutes
to get there. So you like the map integration? Is that your favorite tool? No. What is your
name? So I'm showing you right now. Like, like, so what the fuck? He is going to hit back.
Where? Oh, there's Java. Okay. So when I pull up, it tracks my time. So it's got a geofence.
So it starts to timer. So in case I'm not paying attention, like fence to clock in as it pulls
up, use the address for reference. So automatically clocks you in and get that geofence. Yeah.
So like when I'm there, I'm looking at this. So I got my visit. Alyssa puts my notes
right here. So Rob and Silver is my contact. So I can check out if I want to. And this
is what I'm doing. I got the install for 950. I got a processing fee on there. And there's
my team. So Kelsey and service are on there. So like, service, like things I don't have
to do right now that I'm working on. I keep in the service schedule and keep bumping
them forward. Right. And then I can just look at my Kelsey sketches. I don't get overwhelmed
feeling. Right. And then from right here, the details, this takes me to the company's
information when we have like custom fields of the people. I can go to their address information
right here. I can do most of the stuff from here, like which everyone's start is the one
that's going to get text from here. I could text the guy from right here. And then she
can text him and we all can be texting right here in one location. So gotcha. So that's
powerful to every all the text is all the messages get sent to everybody. But one if you call
this phone number, you're texting it forward straight to my office number. So you just
get picked up. So you can call the number dial extension or you can text it and it receives
pictures and all that. So I really really like that. And then like, so another thing I
like about it is from the home view, like as I'm as I'm finishing jobs and stuff like
that, like when I go to this Arizona, when I get when I get finished here, I can complete
the visit. And it says invoice now or later, I say later because she puts my notes and
she she's dealing with the billing and all that shit. So it goes into a queue basically
of things that she still needs to do today, like things that have been invoiced. And so
like at the end of every day, like right, Alyssa, at the end of every day, like if I say
I completed a job, you have a list over there you're looking at saying like this has to
be invoiced or. So at the end of the day, you get his service list and then he just
while I'm doing it, every time I leave a job, I call her and fill her in on it because
I try and keep her in the loop. I try and keep her in the loop of everything I'm doing
because her memory is not good. And if I don't, if she has no idea what's going on at
all, it's even more confusing. So I try and like call her and explain to her what to
do. And then she takes notes down. Then she's like, okay, now she's put together quotes
for me that I got a review to send. And like, there's just there's so many. Okay, this
is cool though. This is exactly what I'm looking for. So quick question. When he sends you
that report, you're writing them down, right? Well, she's, she's, she's jotting them
down quickly so she can, then she goes to her, okay, cool, awesome, perfect. And then
she transcribes it into job or and everything that we do, I want it to be in job or so
if we're going to be doing something like I'm working on this prayer next door, the
other thing I like about it is this right here, I can show you this, I'm going to cancel
right here. So say I finished this job, but I'm not done. It's like, dang, I need more
part. What I'll do is I'll come over here, I'll schedule a new visit for tomorrow. And
then I can complete this visit. So every time I showed up at this place, it's like a
job and it keeps a track of the history of everything I did. So, and then when I come
over here, I have my notes. So when I'm doing the job, I take a bunch of pictures and then
I come in here and I add the note and I add all the pictures of all the work that we,
that was done. So where are the invoices? To the end of this when you're entering this
versus what you're sending to listen. No, I've already entered all my notes and she didn't
there. But what are you sending to Alyssa that she's writing down on a sticky note?
So occasionally he calls when he, like when I leave and they got like, yeah. So occasionally
he calls when he stops the client, he doesn't have a phone or we're striving, he can't
do it himself, he calls, he gives me all the information, tells me, okay, so I need
you to make a quote and we, this, for this client, include this, this, and this. I drop
that down, okay, cool, bye, I'll get that done. Then I put it down.
So the way this onboarding system works, and just so you know, we have developed started
an agency to help efficient, make things systems more efficient. Communication. So, no, it's
a difficult thing. It's the worst thing. Yes, we're using AI, but AI is the sizzle. It
ain't the steak, right? I don't want to come, like we are AI consultants or AI, an agency,
but ultimately what I'm trying to do is build your own software for Kelsey and plotter mechanics.
So this is exactly what I need. So when you send her the tickets, you're having to call.
What does she doesn't answer? What happens? Do you do the voicemail? She's very good
to answer, but if she does, I text her. So how, when do you prefer him, we may have voicemail
versus you having to write it down. I mean, she probably, okay, so then, how many times
do you say out of five times, he sends the invoice or information that you don't get it?
Are you away from your phone or something like? If she's anywhere, she's at lunch. Is there
a gap where sometimes the information does it get translated correctly and now we build
out an invoice incorrectly and we lost an opportunity? Does that happen often? I mean, not
often, but I mean, some stuff slips through the cracks. But if he texts or he leaves a voicemail
and I don't understand, I mean, he's in the column. Yeah, awesome. Yeah, because I have
a difficult time communicating sometimes when I'm overwhelmed. You know, I'm being barred
by just 500 things in the traffic and how do you like using your voice message? Like, do
you know how you can send a text message by recording yourself? I never do that. I just,
I basically send text messages that don't make sense a lot of times. Can you just try
instead? Like, do you know how to send it? Yeah, totally. When we develop systems, I'm
trying to get these AI voice agents to do a lot of the heavy lifting. I think we talked
about enough of a quarter here to trans, like to cord the office environment. So like,
for instance, yesterday, she had told you about paper that you needed to put on the truck.
Well, that agent would have said, Hey, Kelsey, before you leave, did you grab the paper for
the truck? I mean, that kind of stuff sounds cool to me. I think that's cool. So that,
but that's what I'm trying to say. You know, like I was a perfect instance this morning
about what I'm trying to help you. So I have to refrain from suggesting anything.
What do you know about managing the data? Because before you came along, there was a guy
that was working with my church. And he was putting some API thing together in the back
end that had a whole database of all my information, because I have another database.
You paid like five grand for that. Seven grand. Where is that?
It's I have a folder. Yeah, I do. Okay. Would you would you be would you think it would
be like a situation or a hey, I am working for Kelsey. He asked me to reach out as a
his consultant for this. Yeah. Can we can we do that? And you would I can work as a consultant
for you? Yeah. I think I think I could get him to help me at least, at least educate
you on what he was doing. Yeah. Because I literally have no idea what he was doing.
He spent seven grand. Yeah. So let me not let that go to waste. Yeah. Let's use that
as because I would be really curious to see what data sets he pulled already. Yeah.
Because he had no he had access to everything. Like he was he was he was he was basically
building a database. That was going to connect Shopify, Java, um, basically the whole
back in there was going to be a portal that we would be able to work through. Yep.
And then we would start marketing and doing all this shit. But I never saw any results.
I just kept I stopped paying him every week was something else. He's like, I got to do
this. Basically what happened is I don't think that he understood the complexity of what
I'm actually dealing with on my website with all the different cartridges and model numbers
and all the information. So he said he could do it. But then since we built our website
improperly from the get go, we didn't have the I don't know how they call it, but there's
categories and they call it different things. And we didn't have it that way. For instance,
like we sell paper by the role, but it comes in a two pack. So you can't the inventory management
system kind of fucked up. Do you have an inventory management? No. So there's no inventory
management system. No, it's crap. They have account of what's inside each box and a list.
Our inventory system is garbage. It doesn't work. You can't use it. It's completely
unusable. And I have no fucking clue what I have in stock. Yeah. What do you use to
manage your inventory? Nothing. No, quick books. Nothing. Nothing.
It's nothing. Right there. Good. There. That's what I saw that board. So I was curious
about it. Because it's it's incorrect. I rubbed my arm against the board. What am I wiping
out? Okay. Cool. Okay. So guys, this is these are exactly what like I'm already thinking
about creating again, I got a refrain from what my wife is in the process of right now,
like working with a bookkeeper and like working with a bookkeeper and getting my taxes
and shit in line. And starting January 1st, we're starting with a fresh clean quick
books. Oh, so you have your reconciles reconciles? She's going to deal with all of that.
Yeah. The book keep a $700,000 difference in our quick books. It was fucking crazy,
dude. Like, holy shit. I didn't know how hard it was to reconcile your fucking books.
No, it sucks. I can't do it. Okay. So this is all good. So anyways, she's dealing with
that. So January, we're going to start over from scratch. And I want to I got all these
printers over here and parts and pieces. And I don't have an inventory system. Like if
I knew what I had in stock, I could sell it on eBay and all kinds of shit, but I can't
do anything with it. Okay. So I'm just going to go start going over the basic. So that
thing that he was dealing with was going to have all my inventory. It was going to be
a portal where I was going to be able to add my products, put my images and it was going
to populate all of the different Shopify QuickBooks jobber with one click. Do you know what
I'm talking about? Yeah. That's that's where I was building, but I couldn't work with
the guy, bro. I couldn't manage him. So I, um, he's got the he's got a whole folder full
of his shit. I don't know where it's at. Nikki has it. I'm going to ask her for it. I
took it home. Yeah. Okay. What's that guy's name? John. No, I was. Oh, no. What was
that guy's name that worked for me? The guy that was a web dude that didn't do anything.
Malik. Malik. Hey, do you have that packet of information? Malik gave me after I let
him go at the house somewhere. Question mark. Um, I was about to find it, but I he wanted
me to have all the information. He, he was like adamant about it. Dude, I don't give
a shit about your information. Like, you know, all it's going to happen is I'm going
to go to someone else. They're going to tell me all this bullshit and that they got
a whole other way to do things. And I'm sorry to go through that experience and it makes
my job more difficult, right? But honestly, it makes me better. And this is why we're doing
this, right? You're helping me get better. Ultimately, I'm here to make you more money,
right? That's my plan. When I make you more money, I get paid. And that's how I'm going
about it. But I am seeing the dollar signs and I have to refrain from making any suggestions
right away because ultimately it's not me who's going to modify your operational plan.
It's the team, right? So I have, Macau, he is a systems like engineer, right? He develops
systems, right? He works for the Air Force. He's done contracts with the Pentagon. I have
Trent. He is a robotics engineer. Like, he can build, it's called IOT, Internet of Things.
So that recording system, the camera system that we talked about, like anything you
mind can fathom, like he does industrial communication, industrial programming, industrial,
like shit. I'd be really curious to see what kind of system he can put together for you
just in the hardware itself, like the printers, the scanners, like all of your gadgets, I would
assume are just connected to your network. And the only way you can communicate to your hardware
is via protocol through your Windows database, like to pull up your printer specs, you have to
go to the queue or the app inside your deal, right? Oh, no, you just got to the printers. They all
got wet. Yeah, but I'm trying to make that out. Like, would you, would you like to see all your
printers on one dashboard? And like, like, yeah, and again, I'm just, I don't know what these
guys are capable of. And then I got Matthew. This guy used to work for Amazon. He helped build
Amazon's environment to my, what I'd be, I'll show you their websites. They have their own.
I'm just the guy to help the acquisitions. Now I, you know how I've been since for three years
from now each other. I have been chasing this dream, ultimately, to kind of just help make
connections. And it's been working. And now I developed my first software intellectually.
Didn't know how to really develop it. That's when I paid for this program. That's where I met
these cats. So we're all paid a lot of money just to get into this room to ultimately
help us figure out our own goals. I just so happened in my first week met these guys. And I was
like, it was like meant to be. Yeah. Like I honestly truly feel that I have God's hand and
people's hand on my shoulders. And I'm guiding me along this path. And I'm hearing your problems.
And I'm seeing the opportunity. So what we are working out right now and why I have all these
cameras and, you know, this is like literally the beginning to our agency. You are going to be our
first client that we are going to use this as our rollout method, our onboarding process.
Right. So I appreciate that. And I don't take it lightly. Right. So I took the time last night.
We have these processes. Right. So we have this five question for us to pretty almost hone in
on your constraints. Right. And then the other pages I put together, I did some market research
for you about the opportunities that you shared with me about your wanting to expand a little bit.
But you can't expand if you don't have the processes in person in place to support this expansion.
Right. That you're creating a fucking headache. So what my thought in my plan is let's let's get
this thing. Let's get this shop tuned in, dialed in. Right. So it makes a list of life a whole
lot easier where now she can be working on the business, not in the business. Right. Yeah. And then
same thing with you. Like I and ultimately if we can illustrate to you, Kelsey, that we say to
you or made you a significant amount of money more every month by integrating our systems.
That gives you the ability to level up. It gives you the information. I can afford another 50
dollar coin. He's going to be this this and this and my margin state the same of what I was used to
before. But you can't make those calculations because you don't ultimately know the bottom and
your operational cost or data operation. Yeah. Well, I'm going to have that information here in
January. I should have it fine tuned finally because you don't know how much assets and
inventory you have. No, I don't have that part of it. So that's let's focus on that side now.
Now you're getting your books reconciled and your cash flow statements going. Now let's see how much
money you really have sitting in just inventory. Your machines do know how much each one of these cost.
I don't know. That's what I'm trying to get. No, I don't have any. I think let's start there. So I'm
going to go through these questions. So the first one is the biggest problem. Kelsey, for
plotter mechanics, what is the single biggest operational or financial friction in the business right
now? The problem that keeps you working late. I do everything. I mean, I do everything. I come in
here. I load all this crap into my car. I drive it all over town. I fix everybody's printers while
my phone is blowing up all day long trying to communicate with Alissa between stops and then
fight traffic for an hour. Like last night, you know, one hour to commute home. Like I'm trying to
train Joe. So I can at least split the tasks, you know, so I've been spending time with him working
harder. I'm so exhausted of pouring myself into people like I'm like that's the last dude I'm
pouring myself into man. Like I'm done. So I'm going to I'm going to try and teach him some things.
So he could do half of the jobs at least right off the gate. Half of my task could be alleviated
from me tomorrow. Once I let him lose, I just have been trying to train him and teach him a little
bit more. So I was talking to Joe about that a little bit because you don't have any SOPs. You don't
have any systems in place to make one task redundant. Right. For instance, loading paper, whatever
jobs that need to be done here. First, before moving out into the field, like you don't have
those types of systems in place. Right. For what I gather from talking to Joe, there's no
I mean, we do like as I'm going through the ship with a list all day, you know, she's she's
contacting me saying, hey, let's go over your schedule for tomorrow. You know, like, yeah, this job,
that job, this part, that part, and it's all on yourself over there. I have a shelf that floats
over there that she gets it all right. So all I really have to do is come in, load it in my car
and go. Cool. Cool. So no, I don't think so. I don't know. But do we have the parts?
Are they on the show? So I depends on how I don't think so. That's what I was telling Joe,
like, how cool would it be to have plot of accountants is all like app and, like, say, like,
when you are ready to start onboarding people, the hardest part about onboarding somebody is
a training. How do you get them up to speed? It takes you another week to weeks of training,
right? What if I would have spent time and energy and developing a system to train
people to follow a step-by-step guide to do mundane tasks that need to be done around the shop,
right? But the problem is that you have to spend another dollar, meaning hiring a
have another employee to hold that employee's hand, right? Well, instead of putting that dollar
on an employee that has to keep habitually doing it every single time somebody comes through the
doors as a hire. Well, let's just give them a log in and now they have this app that walk them
through the base responsibility of your position. Oh, and you need to know how to load paper or
printer. Here, here's, here's the printer on your app. Here's all the things you need to know
about this printer. It's all right here. Manuals, instructions, videos, how to load the paper,
what you know what I mean? Like, break it down to that kind of level to help retain quality.
I think that's been one of your point, pain points that you mentioned in the past is that you
can't find quality help, right? And this gives you the ability to at least start finding that
quality. I mean, I guess the problem is like, it's not that I can't maybe find quality help,
it's that I need, I mean, I can't hire somebody and not give them what you said. You know,
a list of things to do. Like, I just expect people just to figure out what to do and just do it.
That's not happening. That's how we operate. But the problem is, Kelsey, is that we leave it
up to interpretation.
