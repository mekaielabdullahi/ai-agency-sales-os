---

### NEW: Financial & Timeline Constraints 🎯

**QuickBooks Reconciliation:**
- **$700,000 reconciliation error** last year

**Kelce's Effective Hourly Rate:**
- Revenue: $600K-$750K/year
- Working ~2000 billable hours/year
- **Effective rate: $300-375/hour**
- Time savings = direct revenue impact

---

### Business Goals (VALIDATED) ✅

**#1 Priority:** Clone Kelce's capabilities
- "If I don't come to work, we make no money"
- "Business would shut down in a couple months without me"
- Magic wand answer: "A reliable field tech I can send to 50% of jobs"
- Training Joe to handle half the jobs immediately

**Current Turnaround Time:** Not quantified
- Kelce spends 1 hour commute each way
- Drives "all over town" doing service calls
- Gets stuck in traffic constantly
- Multiple service calls per day

**Quote/Order Volume:** Not precisely stated
- "Majority of our calls are service calls"
- Getting calls from multiple states for remote support
- New business from posting printer listings online
- **Pattern:** Reactive service model, not proactive quoting

**Scale Goals:**

- Focus on remote consulting ($175 per call)
- Leverage web-based business vs driving around
- "I could be doing remote support all day long"

---

## 📊 Current-State Mapping - VALIDATED

### Service Process (Primary Revenue)

**Service Call Volume:** Daily, multiple per day
- Alyssa monitors map/schedule
- Adds nearby calls opportunistically
- Example: "Quick $500 grab if you're already in 10B"

**Service Call Rate:** $250 standard
- Subcontracts at $150, makes $100 margin
- Quick jobs: $500-1,000
- Remote consulting: $150-500/call
- Complex jobs: 3+ hours on-site

**Service Challenges:**
- Kelce is ONLY person who can do technical work
- Gets called for equipment he's never seen before
- "$3,000 heads, 12 of them" - high stakes
- Can't send Joe to most jobs (not trained enough)
- Training Joe taking significant time

**Win Rate:** Not discussed (service-based, not quote-based)

**Communication Flow:**
1. Customer calls (often Kelce's cell directly)
2. Alyssa answers office line, adds to Jobber
3. Alyssa texts Kelce about nearby opportunities
4. Kelce calls Alyssa after each job with notes
5. Alyssa writes notes on paper → transcribes to Jobber
6. Alyssa creates invoices end of day

**Paper Trail Issues:**
- Old employee would write notes, Kelce finds next day
- "Jim Bob called from Mesa - 5 min from where you were"
- Now Alyssa is better but still manual process

### Quote Process

**Not applicable** - Business is service-based, not quote-based
- No structured quoting system mentioned
- Work is reactive service calls
- Some equipment sales (printers, supplies)

### Customer Communication ✅

**Status Inquiries:**
- Customers call Kelce's cell directly (not office)
- "They know they'll get results"
- Hate voicemail: "I go to next place, bro"
- This is competitive advantage

**Communication Methods:**
- Phone (primary - Kelce's cell)
- Jobber texting (newer)
- Email (Alyssa monitors, Kelce doesn't check)
- Office line (rarely used)

**Response Time:**
- Immediate (competitive advantage)
- Alyssa trained to route urgent calls
- Can add same-day service if nearby

**Pain Points:**
- 4-5 different text/communication systems
- "Nobody calls office, they call my cell"
- Information scattered across platforms
- Messages get read but not marked unread → lost

---

## 💰 Pain Point Quantification - REAL NUMBERS

### "I Do Everything" Pain

**Kelce's Actual Words:**
> "I do everything. I load all this crap into my car, drive all over town, fix everybody's printers while my phone is blowing up, trying to communicate with Alyssa between stops, then fight traffic for an hour to get home."

**Time Waste:**
- 1 hour commute each way = 2 hrs/day
- Multiple service calls across town
- Traffic delays
- Can't delegate 90% of work

**Cost:**
- Lost $10,000 last year total
- Missed opportunities (old note-taking system)
- Can't scale without cloning himself

**Exhaustion:**
> "I'm so exhausted of pouring myself into people. Joe is the last dude I'm pouring myself into."

### Communication/Data Silos Pain

**Systems NOT Talking:**
- Jobber
- QuickBooks
- Shopify
- Capsule (legacy, still paying)
- Outlook/Email
- Multiple text systems

**Kelce's Quote:**
> "I've got Capsule, QuickBooks, Jobber, Shopify - all have different information. Some's got some shit over there, some's got it over here."

**Manual Work:**
- Alyssa adds products to QuickBooks AND Jobber manually
- Kelce calls after each job with notes
- Alyssa writes on paper → transcribes to Jobber
- Old database (Capsule) has all contact info but not migrated

### Inventory Management Pain

**Current State:** ZERO inventory management
- "I have no fucking clue what I have in stock"
- Whiteboard with incorrect counts (gets erased accidentally)
- Can't sell excess equipment on eBay
- "Inventory system is garbage, completely unusable"
- Has printers/parts worth thousands sitting unused

**QuickBooks Issues:**
- $700,000 reconciliation error last year
- Wife + bookkeeper fixing it now
- Starting fresh Jan 1, 2025
- "I didn't know how hard it was to reconcile your books"

**Alyssa's Magic Wand:**
> "If we could get inventory wrapped, that would be fantastic. Then when he calls asking 'do we have this?' I can just look instead of running back and forth."

## 🔧 Technical Environment - DETAILED

### Current Software Ecosystem

**Jobber (Primary CRM):**
- ✅ **Likes:**
  - Map view for scheduling
  - Geofence auto-clock-in
  - Text integration (one thread per customer)

- Not integrated with other systems
- Malik's work was focused here

**Capsule (Legacy CRM):**
- Still paying ~$30/mo
- Has all old customer contacts
- Email sequences
- Not migrated to Jobber
