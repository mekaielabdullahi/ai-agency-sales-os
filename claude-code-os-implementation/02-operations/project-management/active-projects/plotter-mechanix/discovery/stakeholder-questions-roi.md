## Next Steps

1. **Schedule stakeholder calls** - Priority order:
   - Kelsey (45 min) - Phone system and financial baseline
   - Alyssa (30 min) - Phone details and time validation
   - Nikki (30 min) - Operating costs and Malik project review
   - Joe (20 min) - Capability and field needs

2. **Questions to ask in each call:**
   - Use the Priority sections above
   - Focus on getting actual numbers, not estimates
   - Record answers directly in this document

3. **After data gathered:**
   - Validate ROI projections with real numbers
   - Update PRD time estimates if different
   - Calculate actual Vonage savings
   - Present to Kelsey/Nikki with THEIR numbers
