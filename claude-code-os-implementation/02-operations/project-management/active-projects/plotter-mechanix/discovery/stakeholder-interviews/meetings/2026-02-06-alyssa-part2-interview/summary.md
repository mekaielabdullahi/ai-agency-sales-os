## Critical Pain Points Identified

### 1. Email Overload (20-25 hrs/week) 🚨
- **10 separate inboxes:** Personal, sales, accounting, service, printing, info (Jobber), etc.
- **Notification system broken** after recent update - must manually check each inbox
- **Duplicate emails** across multiple inboxes requiring manual cleanup
- Rejected consolidation idea - worried about information overload

### 2. Parts Ordering Inefficiency (45 min/order)
- **30 min research** - doesn't know parts, needs to call Kelsey
- **15 min vendor communication** - quotes, PO creation, follow-up
- **Complex HP parts** - Can take days, multiple vendor contacts
- **HP case example:** Y0U21 67237 part for HP Latex 800W printer

### 3. No Inventory System
- **No inventory sheet exists** - everything done manually
- **QuickBooks inventory inaccurate** - never maintained properly
- **Manual checking required** - "I think we have them, let me check..."
- **Can't link items to PO numbers** for RMA tracking

### 4. Duplicate Client Creation (Quo → Jobber)
- AI creating new clients instead of matching existing
- **"We have seven Daves"** - QuickBooks integration breaking
- Can't merge duplicate requests/clients
- Manual copy-paste workaround required

### 5. RMA Process Breakdown
- **Pile of RMA items from last year** still unresolved
- Vendors won't cooperate without PO numbers and dates
- Started collecting delivery slips but not organized
- **1.5 hrs per complex RMA case**

---

## System Feedback (Phase 1)

### What's Working ✅
- Quo calls creating Requests in Jobber automatically
- Call recordings with links helpful for reference
- Queue system better than nothing
- Reduced some Kelsey→Alyssa handoffs
- Visual calendar with color coding effective

### What's NOT Working ❌
- **Duplicate client creation** (top priority fix)
- AI missing labels and context sometimes
- Can't merge duplicate requests
- Service email can't send outbound
- Field notes not auto-populating
- Timer tracking inconsistent

### Alyssa's Wishlist
- Stop automatic client creation for unrecognized callers
- Auto-populate Kelsey's field notes and time logs
- Barcode inventory system linked to POs
- Customer self-service knowledge base
- Call pre-screening script to route appropriately

## Time Savings Opportunities

### Immediate Fixes (Quick Wins)
| Fix | Current Impact | Time Saved |
|-----|---------------|------------|
| Stop duplicate client creation | 30 min/day reconciling | 2.5 hrs/week |
| Auto-populate field notes | Manual entry after each job | 2 hrs/week |
| Fix AI summary accuracy | Clarification calls needed | 1 hr/week |

### Major Automation Opportunities
| Improvement | Potential Savings | Priority |
|-------------|------------------|----------|
| Email consolidation (10→2 inboxes) | 10-12 hrs/week | HIGH |
| Parts catalog integration | 20 min/order | MEDIUM |
| Barcode inventory system | 2-3 hrs/week | MEDIUM |
| Customer knowledge base | 1-2 hrs/week | LOW |
| Call pre-screening system | 2 hrs/week | MEDIUM |

## Alyssa's "Magic Wand" Priority

**#1 Choice:** Barcode inventory system linked to PO numbers
- Would solve RMA tracking issues
- Enable real-time stock visibility
- Eliminate manual checking
- Connect items to purchase history

**Quote:** "If we had barcodes, that would be so much easier... I'd be able to know exactly and what date it was."

## Key Insights

### The 50% Discovery
**Alyssa spends 50% of her time on email management.** This wasn't fully captured in Part 1 interview. This single improvement could recover a quarter of her work week.

### The Printer Knowledge Gap
Alyssa created "Printer Info for Dummies" document because she doesn't know which paper goes with which printer. This self-initiated solution shows initiative and identifies a training/knowledge base opportunity.

### Calendar Color System
- Dark orange: Service calls (Kelsey)
- Orange: Kelsey reminders/follow-ups
- Purple: Alyssa's tasks
- Green: Printing/Joe tasks
- Light blue: Will-call orders
- Red: Deliveries
- Gray: Office tasks

### The Kelsey Factor
- Operates "on the fly" - priorities change based on dollar value or VIP customers
- No formal priority classification system
- Calendar reviewed daily but changes constantly
- Route optimization using Jobber's map feature working well

## Key Quote

**"That's the majority of my time... Maybe about four or five hours [on email]"**

When asked what she'd do with 5-10 extra hours per week:
- Fill cleaning kits (backlogged)
- Check inventory properly
- Maintain the shop ("I have not been maintaining the shop")
- "Maybe you can finally track down all the missing markers"

---

**Meeting Outcome:** Successfully captured detailed time metrics showing 18-23 hours/week of recoverable time through automation, with email management being the biggest opportunity at 50% of Alyssa's daily work.
