## Full Transcript

I did. And.
Saying ask to join.
Yeah.
Yeah. Sweet. Okay. Oh, your microphone's on.
That's cool.
So it automatically picks it up.
So should I turn off the microphone? Okay.
I just wanted to use this capture the screen reporting.
So cool. We can. For now, let's just go ahead and we can just.
If you click on this tab, you just drag it down and then you hit minimize.
Oh.
Yep.
Oops. There we go.
If it. If it impedes your workflow. Like if I'm just right now just.
Trying to capture this interview while we talk. And then when.
If we need to share your screen, we're plugged in.
Okay.
And so now I'm just gonna get the question pulled up real quick.
Okay.
No worries. I can just send me the link or a PDF. Got myself.
It.
Well, yeah, that just gets saved to.
A folder and it's just a drag and drop at that point. Right. Well, what if. Is there anything we could do right now? Is there anything we can do right now that you guys can see? Because right now she's just typing away and I have her connected to my Google Meets where I can send you the link and you can see her screen right now. Yeah, perfect. Yeah. Yep.
That's right.
Awesome. Let me. Let me send you that link. Yeah, I agree. That's. I even brought an extra camera in the microphone, but she's just using the microphone, so she doesn't need a camera. I just needed. I just want to be able to screen record a couple of things. Yes.
Hey, Alissa, do you mind turning your.
Microphone off so they don't. These guys don't blow your earbuds up.
Give me one moment. Once I figure out where this thing minimized to. There it is.
Yeah. And then. Yeah, I guess. Is there any specific workflow that you would like to see her? Because right now she's in jobber. Right now we're filling out a ticket.
No, just keep doing what she does.
Cool. Sounds good.
Are you currently recording?
Yes, sir. It's on fireflies. Yes, sir.
Yeah, I mean, as long we're recording the screen with fireflies, I think we're good. Cool.
Yeah, I mean, it's recording. I got fireflies in here. And yeah, I've seen her workflow. So. But she only. The problem is that she has to drag everything because she got four screens. So she's dragging everything to this screen for now. So I don't want to keep it. I don't want to have to keep her do. Making her do that. So I'll. I'll just do it for, like, how long? Do you think.
That is a challenge that we didn't even think about?
Right. I know. That's why I walked over a desk. And. And because she has an email on the top right screen. Pop in all randomly, and she needs to be seen, notified. Then she has her messages on QO on the top left screen, and then she has her blank desktop on the left. And then she. She works on this one mainly. So I guess the only thing were not seeing is her notifications from QO and her email mainly, so that shouldn't be too much of an issue. Mainly looks like she's using this one as her workflow, so we should be good.
Okay. And her main notifications are email and. And quote.
Sounds like.
Yeah. Yep. And the phone, but I think the phone's tied to qr, so. Yeah, regardless. So, yeah, we're good there.
Cool. All right.
Were you able to send me that PDF, Matthew?
Oh, no.
Okay, hold on. Oh, geez. I'm getting ready to send you guys an email. I forgot about this. Forward include. Man, Alissa, you're a machine, dude. I know. I could tell. Jesus, Kelsey talks fast. That makes sense. I can't even keep up. I'm gonna hang up on this one. Okay. Just so you guys know, I can't hear you unless you chime in, but there's no. No need. But I can't hear anything you guys are saying, so. Good.
You good?
Yeah, I hit my elbow on the table over here. All right, so. Advanced solutions.
It.
Hey, Trent, are you on here by any chance, still? Yeah, yeah, I'm here. Oh, cool. Hey, awesome. I'm gonna go ahead and leave my microphone on so the fireflies can pick up the interview at the same time. Oh, sounds good. Are you okay with that?
Yeah, that's.
That's perfect, actually. Awesome.
Cool.
So I'm gonna go ahead and continue the interview. Is this is. I want to move to your desk. Give me one second. Stand by.
Okay.
Do you mind if I place this right here?
Yeah, don't mind. Melissa's using it to label things.
Is this network?
I think so.
No power. What is this thing?
Honestly, no idea. I've never used it.
Okay, so it looks like it has power. I don't want to. There's stuff plugged in. I don't want to mess with it. Let's see. No power, but be fine for now. I think 42% will be more than enough for now.
I'll just keep an eye on it.
Hold that. So a part of this. So the Guys have constructed some, you know, some questions to help identify some stuff. And we wanted to say thank you again for meeting with us. You know, the last time we learned how much you are the operational hub for everybody. Today we want to dig deeper into the time you spend specifically on the task so we can figure out where automation would help the most. So we're just going to ask you some questions, and it's meant to, like, help us understand the hours and the time that you spend just doing processes. And what we're trying to identify is how can we help make you more efficient?
Well, the good news is you recorded a few of them, so, yeah, pretty good idea.
Yes. So luckily, we've been screen recording that whole time, which has been very helpful. And then now we're just going to kind of continue with some questions. And then these questions are just geared honestly to help us calculate time savings. So just. You don't have to be precise. Just try to give me the best rough idea estimate possible. Okay, so how many hours do you work a week total per week?
8 hours, sometimes over, depending on.
So are you paid for 40, but sometimes you work 45, I think.
Usually 42.
42. And do you get paid? 42?
Yeah.
Okay.
Yeah, I get paid for everything.
Okay, cool. 42. Awesome. How much time per week on calls with Kelsey, do you think?
Per week on calls? That's a good one.
If you run. If it makes it easier. Breaking it down by the day.
So he calls on average, I guess about four or five times per day. And I guess those calls take, you know, let me actually check my call log.
There you go.
That's actually a really good way to do that.
Yeah.
All right, let's see. Yesterday he was here at the office. So that's not a good one. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. So six one day. 1, 2, 3, four, five, six. Six on my other. Okay, so six is an average. Okay, let's see how long I spent. Let's see. So that one was 17 minutes. He was probably talking with someone else during that time. 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27. Still about half an hour a day.
Okay, six calls per day. So let's just say most of them.
Are about two, three minutes.
Okay.
With an exception of if he's also talking with someone else.
So it's pretty, say, average. Four minutes a call.
34 minutes. Yeah.
Okay, we'll just say four minutes. Call how much time per week or per day? Entering data into jobber after Kelsey's call. So how long does it take you once Kelsey calls to enter in? Let's just stick to one task.
So he calls in about something specific and then I have to put in the stuffy jobbers and he'll give me notes, I'll write down the notes, then I'll have to input it. So maybe about 10 minutes.
Okay, 10 minutes per call for a new client. 10 minutes. And what about for 10 minutes new client and for an existing client?
Five to six probably.
Okay, five to six, existing. Beautiful. How much time per week on scheduling slash calendar management? Do you spend.
Go ahead.
Like setting up the calendars for Joe Kelsey, like walk me through that. Do you set up calendars or is.
Yeah, I move things around. Usually I try to go over the calendar with Kelsey at the end of the day so he's ready for the next day average that it takes. Is this with Kelsey taking calls and things in between?
No, this is just straight up. Yeah, this is just specifically the task coordinating with scheduling and calendar.
So that really depends on how much is on the calendar. So for example, like once it loads. So if it's only like four things are on the calendar and we're just going over and seeing if any of these need to get moved over, then three minutes. Maybe three minutes. If it's something more like what I have here going on. It depends on off the top of my head how much I know and I know Kelsey's going to this place. I know Kelsey's going to this place. He's going to be completed. So we're going to go over the next day, which is all of this and we're going to move some of these out.
Is there, is there a reason what the color codes being.
Yes. So the dark orange. These are service calls. Specifically service.
Orange service. Okay.
Specifically Kelsey just Kelsey. Not service or anything. Usually it's for him. Reminders, follow ups, that kind of thing. Purple, that's me. That's just specifically. I'm keeping track of those things. Green is usually printing or Joe, I believe light blue is for will calls. So these are people who call in, they order something and they're going to come and pick it up eventually.
Okay. Okay.
Red is deliveries and this new one is Andrew. And gray is just tasks that they're not really. They're not jobs or anything. They're just, hey, do this when you're in the office.
Install solar panel for camera.
Yeah, we have the.
Oh, gotcha. Okay, so who created that one? Kelsey?
Yes. So Kelsey created that one for gel. Specifically Got it.
Now, I saw Joe this morning. He had a delivery and he's like, oh, I am actually going to be en route by close tomorrow's delivery.
Yep. So this delivery, I put it on the schedule for tomorrow because usually when we have a delivery and I'm not sure where he's going to be going, I put it on the next day. So that way we have a time to get everything together, put it on the shelf. No rush. If he's busy, it won't bother him.
Got it. And does he ever miss those opportunities for knocking? Two birds, one stone.
I wouldn't say Mrs. I'd say he looks at his calendar and says, oh, no, I can't do this at this day.
Oh. So he systematically.
Yeah, he's keeping track of his own calendar pretty good. Every now and then I'll double check with him on something.
Cool. And have you found any errors related to calendars or anything like that?
No.
Okay.
It's been pretty straightforward.
Now, as far as calendars go, is there any way possible that you can see a way for being a day ahead, three days ahead?
Is that like. What do you mean?
Like you say you go over Kelsey's schedule the night before.
Yes. So that's to prepare him specifically me. I see everything.
No, no. Yeah. So I mean, is there a way that we can design something where Kelsey's three days ahead?
I'm afraid not. Because Kelsey, he's on the fly type of thing. It's some new job that takes priority, comes in, he's going to make sure that's prioritized. Everything else is going to get.
So that prioritize means dollar value. Right. Because if he jumps on this issue right now, he can make an extra thousand dollars that day.
It's either dollar value or it's like existing clients who specifically use us for everything.
Got it.
So then to make, to keep the customer satisfaction value high, you are able to adjust the calendar or your task today, like, oh, we can push him off tomorrow to ensure this. Our primary customers.
Yes.
How many do you have your customers in sections for the high priority, mid priority, low priority customers?
We don't have a list for that. It's just you work here, you know.
So would it be hard to develop something like, could you say, yeah, this customer boom, high priority, like be easy to classify that? Relatively easy?
Not specifically. I mean, I know which clients are constantly ordering from us, so I can kind of develop something of a list. But it's Kelsey, who knows which ones are going to take priority so if.
We gave Kelsey a list and then he had three buttons, you can say this customer, high priority, this customer, low priority. This customer. He could probably do that real fast. Okay, perfect. Beautiful. So you said. And then the time. So you said three minutes per day, you said. Or how did you say? How did you. How many time. How much time you say per day? Do you spending the calendar on the calendar? Yeah.
About an average of maybe three to.
Five minutes per day.
Yeah, every day. Going over the calendar.
Okay, so you just look at the calendar to get an idea to what your day looks like. Takes five, three to five minutes. So this is say five.
I look over the calendar, I call Kelsey. I go over the calendar with him each row by row, not including my tasks. Sometimes he asks about my tasks, but usually it's just deliveries. Him.
So you're just going over Kelsey's calendar.
Specific.
Specifically.
Specifically, that's just Kelsey's calendar. And then we go over the next day as well.
Okay, so then I would say that would take an hour. It doesn't take that long to go over Kelsey's calendar for.
Oh, per week.
Yeah, for. I'm just saying per day. So per day you're going over the daily calendar, and then you're anticipating tomorrow's calendar. So you're technically going over two calendars in one sitting.
I'd still put it around five, ten minutes.
Wow. Okay, cool.
I go pretty quick, and Kelsey talks quick. So our quickness kind of.
I'm gonna put 10 minutes just. Yeah, just a good buffer there. I thought it was way more than that. So that's impressive.
Per day. Now we're pretty awesome.
We know it's 10 minutes. Let me say per day.
Okay.
How much time per week on invoicing, completed jobs or per day?
I guess it really depends on the jobs. But invoicing one job normally takes about three, four minutes.
Okay, one job. One job equals four minutes. Okay, how much time per week or per day on parts? Ordering workflow? Not really sure what that means. What.
Okay, ordering parts. That. That's going to get me. It can take. It can take me about half an hour to try and figure it out because I don't know parts. I have to do research. I have to look in the service.
Okay, so you're spending an hour just researching. 30 minutes.
30 minutes.
30 minutes researching. Okay, 30 minutes.
Just straight up research to find out.
What is where or what needs to go.
What part needs Colin, Kelsey saying, hey, is this the part on the front of the machine or is this the part.
Can Andrew help with that at all?
To some degree. He's more of an ink guy.
Gotcha. So he does it more than that. So that's. So that's why Kelsey needs to be involved, because he knows the parts, and.
Half the time, even Kelsey isn't 100. Sure. Especially with the newer machines.
Right.
Okay, that makes sense.
Yeah.
Hey, babe, I'm. No, that's fine. I'm in the middle of the interview right now. I just wanted to say hi. Love you.
Bye.
Okay, that makes sense. So 30 minutes research. And then actually placing the order.
After the quote is paid and approved. Placing the order takes. Well, you actually.
Okay, so real quick. Then you said after. So you find the part, you get the part number. That takes you 30 minutes. Then you send. Hey, this is how much it's going to cost.
Yeah.
So you got to create.
No, wait, wait. Let's get the part.
Okay.
I have to reach out to the vendor and say, hey, you got this part and how much does it cost? And then I put it on the quotes.
So does that now in 30 minutes? Is that included in that 30 minutes or the 30 minutes is research plus research only. And then the additional two steps takes you 15 minutes.
Let's see, about three more minutes to write the email, maybe five minutes to get the quote together. Then once the email comes back to me with a price, a few minutes, just adding that in there and sending.
Yeah, so an extra 15 minutes. So four to 45 minutes. Is that just one part?
That's just one part.
Holy canoli.
I don't know. My parts.
Yeah, 30. Yeah. 30 minutes research. So let's just say.
And if there's a part that we. I can't figure out, like recently the other day, Kelsey has had to reach out to HP for their guys over there to try and figure out if this is the part that we actually need. There's.
Oh, that's when. That's when that other guy came into the picture that he wants me to meet. Okay.
Probably.
Yes, yes, I remember him. That's when he was talking about. He rekindled some old connection with hp because he was talking about. He had to find a part possibly. So you don't remember that. The name or what printer that was.
I know it's an hp. It was for, let's see, Projections. That was a printing place. Printing specialists.
Printing specialists. And they had. Oh, you look at that. You even got the ticket. Look at you. So good. Okay.
All right, so let's see. There it is. The case number. For hp, the CRM.
Okay, can I. Can I read that out loud, though? Case number is 515-493-6335. And then we don't have a part number or a model number.
We have a part number that we suspect is the part, which would be this part number.
Y0U21 67237. And this is for a large format Primer pump for HP latex 8,000 W800. 800 W printer. Perfect.
Yes. That's what we're suspecting is the correct part, because the. This printer also has a white, and it has a different part number, and it says the exact same thing, white. But we didn't know that it had a separate pump for that. And now we're suspicious because some printers have a separate pump for every color. We're thinking this is for all colors, but we can't absolutely identify it. Yes. Based off of what I saw in the service manual, it's very bad at wording things. This part is a color for all the colors, and then it has a separate one for the white.
Interesting. So.
So that's what we're suspecting. That's what we're trying to figure out with hp. They are.
And how often does that come up?
This is the first time this year.
Oh, okay. Maybe. Okay. So do you remember these same instances happening last year?
Definitely. Yeah. There's been a couple.
They say five.
Five.
And so how much additional time did that add you?
Well, we started this the day before yesterday, so it's been three days now.
So for this one particular, trying to.
Figure out this part and confirm with HP that this is the correct part so that we don't order the wrong part.
So would it be safe to say 2 hours, 3 hours, 4?
Let's see. Kelsey was talking on the phone, and now.
Yeah, Including. I want Kelsey's time.
Yeah, he was on the phone for about an hour, I'd say. That's crazy because he called him twice. And then there was the hold and everything. And then me reaching out to Jacqueline at Arc Imaging to see if she has any ideas. And she's not a parts person, but she can look on HP's website and find the part and tell me what it is, just to confirm. Which is another reason why I think it's that. So all of that together, maybe an hour total hour and a half.
Okay. And then that happens around five times a year. Cool.
Yeah.
Awesome. Awesome. That's. Let me write that.
That's because we don't got an HP parts guy.
Okay. And why? And now. But now it looks. I think you do now from what Kelsey was saying.
I hope so.
I know so. Let me say five times, year, extra 1.5 hours.
Okay.
How much time every day in the mornings do you spend managing emails like that? Like in the day, I see you have 10 email boxes, inboxes. Right. I see you in the morning going through them.
Yes.
And I see throughout the day, I see I'm popping up on your screen. Let's break that down a little bit. Why so many?
Because they're each for a different thing. We've got our own personal emails, so people want to contact us directly. They have that. We have the accounting email, which is all the invoices, all of the orders. We have the sales email, which is specifically for sale. Someone wants to order parts, it's going to go in there. Receipts from vendors, that's going to go in there. Some vendors go to accounting, but you know, like online vendors, that's. They go into the sales. We have a service email which is probably the least used, interestingly enough, because for some reason I can't email out of it and I don't know why.
So we gotta check the service outbound settings.
That's. That's.
I don't know what's going on with.
That, but I can't email from service.
Does that create issues?
Not really because I just use sales or my own personal or accounting, depending on what it is.
Okay.
And then we have printing, which is the one that Joe mainly manages, but I keep an eye on when he's out doing services that specifically for customers who want us to print something for them. They give a description, they send files.
Okay.
And then feel like I'm missing something. Oh, yeah. Info is the new one that's connected with Jobber. That one is Jobber related.
So has that been helpful?
Yeah, I think so. All the requests that pop up go to this. Any quote, people accept the quote or pay the quote.
And so you're manually having to keep track of all these emails boxes like you were showing me earlier when you updated the 10 because it didn't show the notifications on the. Right. That's what you depend on to understand the flow of the inbox is to make sure you're on top of it very much.
But for some reason only my inbox is starting to show how many is in there and everything else. I need to go in there and double check. See, I didn't see that.
Right. So you have to manually go and click every box increments. Of time to ensure you're staying on.
Top of it now? I do, yeah. This wasn't a problem before. This updated automatically yesterday. Really? Yeah. I don't know what caused the update to go through.
We'll look into that. We'll look into that. So on a daily basis, what do you think you're spending? Just managing emails.
Just looking at emails or looking at them and doing whatever's related to them.
Exactly.
Okay. On a daily basis.
Yeah.
That's the majority of my time, I think.
Majority of your time? Really?
Yeah, I'd say that's the majority of my time.
You say your majority of your time is keeping up?
If I do eight hours.
Yeah. Yeah.
Maybe about four or five hours.
Is that okay? So whatever you're not doing, everything else, you're pretty much emailing, saying. Exactly. Okay, cool. So let's just put all day. I'm just gonna put that.
Okay.
All day.
When?
Not.
Okay. How much time a day are you spending on customers calls?
That's a lot less. Usually Chelsea is handling that, but whenever he. Now with the new quo system, we got this. We got this system in place where if it rings three times and Kelsey does not pick up, then I pick up and handle it. So that's been helpful. Helpful.
How often does that happen.
On average? Per day? I'd give it about half an hour.
Sweet.
Not really that much.
Okay. Half hour per day.
Yeah.
30.
Whatever. He doesn't catch a handle and it goes pretty quickly.
Cool.
Unlike Kelsey, I don't go on tangents.
Right. How much time on RMA tracking and follow up?
Oh, my gosh.
Or should you be spending more time?
I definitely need to be. But at the same time, getting in contact with the vendors and actually getting them to go through with the stuff is so the. You see that pile behind you? That's all RMA stuff. And most of that is from last year.
This.
Yep. I. I can't get the vendors because they're asking for very specific details, and we have not had a very good way of keeping track of where or when we got the products. Products. Recently I started. Whenever we're getting inks and stuff, I started writing down the PO number.
Oh, to reference.
Yeah, exactly. So if anything happens with that bag.
Or with where those pos live.
QuickBooks.
Okay.
So I can just.
All the vendors. Orders that you've made for the ink live in QuickBooks.
Yes.
Cool.
So I think that will help us a lot. But a lot of the vendors are saying, oh, hey, you've had this item for three months. We can't refund our needs to be.
A system in place that pretty much automatically starts reminding people or up. If an email comes through, it says, hey, you need to do this. I don't know how that works, but.
You'Re saying we have an RMA system. Megan helped this great one. I've been trying to follow it, but it gets stuck when the vendor just won't comply, so.
So.
Where is it? Rma. There we go. R me process.
I'm gonna need to copy this.
Yeah, I'll print that out.
Awesome. Do you have it saved somewhere?
I do, yeah.
I think I emailed these to you before, didn't I think you asked for them a while back then.
I just. Just to be safe. Chris, that's Trent. Keep going down. Keep going down. Yep, yep. Go ahead and break that one.
This one. Okay.
And then go ahead and put. Trent put. Because you already have his email in there and. Yeah, and he.
Because he will spell it.
That one right there and then. Yep. And we put it. Put it.
That'd be great.
While you're doing that, our written process.
So how much time do you think you're spending right now on just RMAs or a day or. I guess it might be easier to answer this one in a week.
It's not that much. It's just that it drags.
Right. So. Because I'm not. Because you get. There's a get. You get hung up.
Exactly. Like, recently, we had one of our. We had one of our ink bags leak all over the place. And the specific vendor that we get it from, they want all the details about the order. They want to know the PO number. They want to know the time, the date.
Yeah.
And I have to try and figure out when we order this bag because there's nothing on that bag that tells.
Us when and how do these bags come in.
They get shipped in.
So when they get shipped in, it comes through FedEx or UPS. And so there's a delivery slip. I'm assuming that's associated. Where do those delivery slips go?
I have started collecting them.
Oh, good.
Right up in here. These are all.
Okay, awesome. So these are all the delivery slips.
I am not very organized with them. I keep them all together, but they are not spread out by.
So if there was a way that we can, like, have, like, something where you get a delivery in and if the scanner was just sitting right there and you just put it in there and hit the button and automatically went to a folder, would that be helpful? And then that would be cool.
But how Would I find a specific keyword? The specific thing it comes in as MS.31 one liter bag.
Yes.
And that's on several orders. And I don't know which order will.
Be able to actually eventually take the scan.
Yeah.
Put it into a database and then look up the keywords that were on the invoice.
That would be awesome.
And then we can cross reference the keywords with the RMA process to tie into this revolving automation to consistently be checking in on these vendors.
If we had barcodes, that would be so much easier.
So we are eventually going to get barcodes.
Yeah, eventually I'd be able to know exactly and what date it was.
So if we had a process of cool shipments. Here, here's the barcodes to be attached to every single thing. And then that gets referenced and queued and put on the shelves.
And in case we have an issue, I have a way to reference, link it to when it was ordered, what PO number it was, and then send that all to.
Awesome.
That would probably speed up the RMA process a lot.
Cool. I, I, this is huge. So cool. And then real quick preparing deliveries. How much time do you spend preparing deliveries?
Usually we only have like two deliveries. One, two. Two deliveries a day. So I put it into the system and then I have to go to the other office. I have to prepare it on the delivery shelf. 15 minutes.
15 minutes?
Yeah.
Okay.
Per day. Now there's the. Here's a lot. But that was like the main one time date down. So we already answered the question with Kelsey about time with that you spend on calls with Kelsey, data entry and jobber every day. What are you thinking? Just. We'll just kind of just shoot off the cuff.
Well, you have that wonderful recording, me making, like two jobs.
Yeah. So like three minutes, five minutes?
Five, ten minutes.
Okay, so between data entry, I'm gonna say five per entry. And how many entries you think a day?
Oh, That's a very good question.
Average 10, 7, maybe out 7. 7, 7, 7.
It could be less, it could be more.
But per.
Yeah.
Okay. Scheduling, calendar. We already went over that. Invoicing hours, you think for just invoicing. Let's try to keep it on the week on this one.
Oh, on the week.
Yeah.
Okay, so if it takes me maybe like three minutes per invoice and I got seven.
Yeah, it depends if it makes it easier per day.
Let me see.
Hold on.
I've got calendars.
There we go. There we go.
All right, so 1, 2, 3, 4, sine, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11.
12.
13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18. So I'm just going to estimate about 22 jobs per week. Get invoiced perhaps.
And roughly about 3, 4 per day per. Per.
About. We'll put 4 per minute for invoicing. So whatever that math is.
I got it. I got. Okay, four per minute at 22 average per day.
Per week.
Per week. 24 minutes. 22 average.
It's about four minutes. 22 jobs per week. That will be. That's about 88 minutes total.
Cool.
Awesome.
Parts. We already part ordering, order, engagement, customer calls. We already spent on our MA track. We already went over delivery prep. We went over, okay, Kelsey's communication deep dive. How many times per day does Kelsey call with you on updates? We already.
Yeah.
Then went over that. Any average length of those calls? We already went over that. How many times per week do you call Kelsey back to clarify?
That happens about just as much as he calls me, maybe. Hold on, let me see.
Questions.
So if kelsey calls me 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 times, I might call him back 2 or 3.
3.
Let me see. 1, 2, 3. Let's put three average.
Okay. Per week.
Per day.
Per day. And then that's on average 5 minutes, 4 minutes.
Let me see. On average, usually about two minutes. Unless it's going over his calendar, in which case that's more like 10.
Okay. How many times or how much time do you think you're estimating on wasted time because of interruptions?
I wouldn't call it full on wasted time because it's still getting.
Right.
We're still doing some kind of work.
But is there time that you can identify that you feel like, man, I'm wasting my time? I. I feel like I'm wasting my time.
Yeah. The RMA process. I feel like I'm wasting my time communicating with these people and gotcha.
And getting nowhere. You're like, I'm waiting.
Okay.
And it's like, I know. I think you're like, you're trying to show Megan, like, listen, this was happening, but there's like, no way to, like, show a resolution because you'd be stuck on the phone for hours and then nothing else is getting done. Right.
Okay, well, we can't help because it's been over this many months. And then I have to try and tell Kelsey to get in contact with the owner because he's got the connection to tell him to, hey, can you get him to, you know, tell his people over here that we. We keep things on the shelf? They know this.
Yeah, yeah. And how many times a week does Kelsey send missing information to you?
Missing information?
Yeah, like, did it get in the jobber or something? Forgot to get put. Put in or.
It's actually gotten better since Quill happened.
Oh, that's good to hear. Thank you for that.
So now I'd say just per week, right?
Six per day or per week. Whatever you think. Whatever. Whatever. Easy. Quantifiable for you.
Okay.
There's a power strip right here.
So he doesn't have enough time. Then I got to call him, and then I got to figure that out or I gotta reach out to the client. So if it happens at least twice a day, I'd say about 10 minutes.
Yeah, 10 minutes per day. There's a plugin. I don't want to disconnect anything that might turn the computer off. 10 minutes per day. How much time tracking down missing information do you think you spent?
Five to 10 minutes as well, I'd say.
Okay, Kelsey, handoff cost calculator. So Kelsey's calls, times, minutes. That doesn't make sense. Part ordering workflow. How many parts do you order? We already asked. How long does it take? We already. How long does it take to get a quote back from a vendor?
Typically about half an hour. Oh, arc imaging is pretty fast. Graphtec is pretty fast. So, yeah, about half an hour on average, per me sending an email asking for a quote on the part.
Half hour, you said? I'm sorry.
Half hour.
Okay. How long does it take you to send the customer quote? I think we already went over that. To be like three or four minutes, I think you said depending on if.
I have to do research or not.
Oh, yeah, that's right. Yeah, that's on the part if we have to. Okay. Yeah, we broke that down pretty good, actually. And then that's also included in the PO because you have to send that out, wait for approval. Right. Then you do you have to ever track shipments and pestered the vendors for the shipments?
Yeah.
How often does that happen, you think? If you were to, say, a month, does this happen on a monthly basis?
It seems maybe about five times a month when I actually have to pester people like, hey, how's tracking going with this?
Would it be safe to say in that month about an hour of your time is devoted to tracking?
I think that would be pretty reasonable.
Yeah, I think so.
Oh, hey, Frank Martinez. Kelsey got to it first. Okay. It's fine.
Cool.
He'll talk with them.
And so. So does it show when Kelsey's talking to somebody, or does it. I'VE never. I honestly haven't seen this QO setup. I've heard about it. I just haven't seen it.
I think it should, but I don't know which one he called.
No worries. We'll stay focused.
Oh, there we go. Kelsey on a call.
Oh, cool. Awesome. Cool. Part, ordering time, calculator request, vendor quote, we already went over. Quote, request, customer quote, payment process. We already went over. Create the P.O. We already talked about, track shipment. Okay, cool. Now what is this we already talked about?
It's not ringing.
Go ahead.
Oh, there we go. Yeah, I'll grab that one. Hello, Plotter Mechanics. I don't know what happened here.
I think, I wonder if my meetings.
Hello, Florida Mechanics.
I think it's the.
Yes, this is Alissa. Yes, yes.
Yeah, so I got a text in there about 15 minutes away. Sorry, too late. But I think one box.
Okay, perfect. I actually told the delivery driver to check with you on that once he gets over there. So he brought two boxes just in case. Just let him know you only need one box. You are welcome. All right, bye.
Way to anticipate that. I think it's because I. I'm the Google's team's connected to your microphone. I think it might be inhibiting too.
Well, that's probably exactly.
Sorry about that. We'll make this faster. So we already went over emails. How many emails you process a day? We already went over that. How many you think you process a day emails? I don't think we said exactly how many per day.
That's a lot of emails.
Let's just go. Let's just go to sent items real quick.
Wait, hold on. Deposit. Oh, yeah, this was the earlier deposit. Okay. Yeah, this is fine. I don't need those send items for today.
Let's go to yesterday. Let's go to Yesterday real quick.
1, 2, 3, 4, 5.
Is that just one email or all your emails? Emails.
That's a good question.
I think it's just one for the Alissa.
I think that just might be for me.
Okay, so if you're saying five and do you think you. Do you mainly email out of this.
One or mainly out of my own? Yeah.
Okay, so we'll just say about. Let's just say you think 10 a days is a good rough. It's estimate for average per day or seven. What do you think is a good average per day email send?
I think 10 will be closer.
10 per day. Okay, we already went. How much time you go checking and sorting emails? Is there a specific value you want?
Oh, and those emails Are not counting us sending anything from Jobber. Okay, so like quote or follow ups or invoice.
Okay. And how much time do you think that takes you?
That's a bit quicker maybe on average for sending emails set up there. Let's just go with 10 minutes.
Okay, cool. Average per day and then how much time per. So checking and sorting emails. You think so on a day? So just checking the emails, sorting the emails like.
At the start of the day, it takes maybe about a half hour and then it's smooth sailing from there.
Usually 0.5 per day.
Yeah.
0.5 hours. Okay. Do you ever find duplicate emails?
Yes, some people do send the same email to for example, sales to me. Kelsey.
Do you waste time with duplicate emails?
Not really. If I answer them from my own inbox, then I just delete the other ones. Yeah.
Do you. If you were able to consolidate email boxes, do you think that would help save time? I've turned them all into one nor any of them that turned maybe one into two or like consolidate any types of emails. Would that help you save time at all where all the emails just showed up in one and then you saw ever all you.
I think if they all turn into one, that would get overwhelming. This way at least I can tell what I'm saying.
Same setup. Okay, Same setup. Right. And you know what email boxes are.
Okay.
But then you had another little thing on the side and says here are all your emails in synchronicity with each other.
So I could just do one look.
And I'm like, okay, so at 1052, this email folder got emailed. And then at 1020, at 50 this one got in time. Synchronicity. You have all your emails in time. And then if you needed to go to a specific just like that.
I think it would honestly be a bit redundant. Okay, cool.
That's all I'm asking. And then do you waste. We were yes. Consolidated new system readiness on the QO system call. So if all calls came in one phone system with transcripts, would that help?
I think that would probably be more helpful than having the separate phones. I know people or a couple customers have said, you know, I just don't know which phone number to call. We have so many. So just smooshing it all into one would probably help.
Okay, number. If calls auto created jobber requests with AI summaries. Would you what info would you.
Need with EI summaries?
Job requests with AI summaries.
Oh, okay. Well, the name of the person, the name of the company. What kind of printer they have or if they're ordering something. What kind of paper type are they ordering specifically? I need the width, the length and how many pounds.
Do they typically know that when they.
No, we have to ask.
So, so the clients that call.
If it's a normal customer who has been ordering us for a while, they can say just order my usual paper, the 30 inch one and we need it by this date.
So if there was a way you're like, oh, I don't know what kind of role I have. I don't even know what kind of printer I have. Well, if we could say, okay, if you go to the mic, you should see it right there on the side, right?
Yes.
And then like okay, Mr. New Customer, we applauder Plotter. We understand that this is an issue. I'm going to send you a link that you can identify all of your materials. Would that be helpful?
I wish I had a link like that. That would be great. Because I don't know what paper goes to what plotter. I have a general idea like this T630, we sold a bunch of those and we've handled a bunch of paper for those. So I know that Those take the 36 by 150 rolls. They can take the 30 by 150 rules but it can't be over 150 for.
So you need, if you need like a way to be like you need it for yourself. But yeah, and it would be cool for your customers. Like oh, just so you know, I, I put the information in and I could send this over to you just so you have your specs. But yes, we have those in stock and we could send that out to you tomorrow.
So I actually started the list. Printer info for dummies. Sorry, I self titled it.
No, I love it. Can you put that in that email that you were putting to send him to me? Just drag it over there and if.
It decides to ever open. But it's unfinished, it's incomplete. But from.
Hey, all we need is the start. That's all we need is just that. What we need is something that looks like.
So anytime I'm not too busy. This is what I've been doing.
Can you drag that to the bottom?
Oh yes. So this is what it is. I put the type how big it is. I put a picture so that I can see.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
What kind of ink it takes. So this one takes the 300. It also takes the 130ml. This is our old pricing. So this Is irrelevant at this point.
Okay.
But printhead, it takes that. It will take a refurbished one. It's a dye based system. And these are the ink types that it takes.
Interesting.
It's pigment based for the MK dimensions. How big it is, media size. I figured that was important.
Oh, and that's why.
So it takes by the. It takes up to 36. Takes them to the eight point.
Right, right.
Yeah, whatever.
Right.
And here's the papers that we have sold for it.
Awesome.
So it takes the 300. It takes the 150 or I'm not sure if it takes the 300. I think it only takes the 150. So this might be a misinformation.
Can you put that. No.
T930. I think it does.
Okay. Can you put that file in that email? Let's just keep that email open because that's. This is like crazy helpful.
This is irrelevant. The cost and the price changes constantly.
Yeah.
I don't know why I have that.
That's fine. Yeah. Yep. Yeah. And we won't reference any. We're more or less that right there.
Yeah. The pricing, 630, it only takes the 150 rules.
And then what helps us though is then now we have. We're. So the pricing I know, understands, fluctuates, but it gives us how you like things to look. And then we can work off of that. So this is this like. We're gonna turn this into your new baby. We're gonna turn this into your new baby. So awesome. I love that. And if more things you create like that for us, the better. Just so you know.
So 5650, they have a 24 inch and a 36 inch.
That's cool. Yes. I'm gonna put yes on that one. All right. So do you mind just dropping that in that email real quick? So we.
Let me get out of this. Where did I start that email?
It's probably in drafts.
There it is. Oh, yeah. I cannot figure out where. There it is. The attachment thing. That's computer.
We'll just. We'll keep this open because it might. We might need to add more to it at the end of it.
Yep.
And anything else you think you find helpful like that we would. We would definitely love.
Yeah. But that's me self dating because I got tired of not knowing anything.
What was the other one that were going to put in your. The RMN process.
Yes, the army processes, which I need to remember where the heck I put them. Are they in here? I think they were in here somewhere.
You Should. If you type, search on that top right and just type in RMA right here, see what comes up.
There's more. Okay. Oh, Jobber General Info. Okay, that's probably where it is. Okay, hold on. Shared files. Jobber General Info. There we go. How to get paid Honestly.
Can you send us all those?
Yep.
Perfect.
Open.
Beautiful.
There you go.
Beautiful. Okay, cool. Now move on to the next. Would you prefer a queue of request or live phone calls?
It's a queue of requests. Oh, you mean the thing that's popping up in Job or it just says.
Request, request a queue. Would you rather have a queue of them?
That's a difficult one because the requests that are popping up in Job or. First of all, there is a lot. Then I do have to go through it either way. But it also does have some information about what's with the call and it has the link to the call. The link to the call is the one that I like the best.
The link to the call is the.
AI sometimes doesn't catch things and miss labels.
Right, right. Well, it's getting better, but yeah, it takes a minute to happen. Okay, so you. Okay, so. So do you. Would you prefer a queue then, or would you like right now? Is the queue working or fighting you?
I think it's a pretty decent middle ground right now because on the one hand, it is taking up more of my time to go through it, but on the other hand, I am able to take these calls, link them to the jobs, which helps Kelsey a lot. When he's like, what did this guy say again? I just click on the link and then I'm like, yeah, so this is what he said.
And. And is there. Is there something you wish it can. We can just modify real quick then on your. To make your operation with QO a little better. Like, other than having.
If there was a way to make that AI happen in QO rather than in Jobber, because it's making these requests and these requests are duplicating. And then Jobber, right here, hold on, has issues with QuickBooks because it's trying to get all these contacts into QuickBooks integrating. And then we have like seven Daves and it's saying client display names must be unique. So I have to go in. I have to figure out which Dave it is, what company is the state for, and update that because now we have another Dave in QuickBooks.
Yeah.
And it's trying to create him as a customer.
So you're trying to limit.
Even though he already exists as a customer under a company, but so the.
AI in Jobber is making the confusion rate higher because AI is confused. In Jobber.
The AI is doing its thing, but it's the requests coming in.
Gotcha.
So each time a request comes in, if it's a customer that is not recognized either by their phone number or their name, Jobber pops in and automatically creates a new client. Linking that request.
And you want to stop that linking.
I would appreciate if that linking stopped. Because a lot of these clients are related to existing organizations. But because they're coming in as these requests that Jobber is not recognizing as under that corporation, it's creating a whole new client. And I can't merge them.
Got it, Got it. So be in. So because it or AI tagged it and you're trying to reclassify it, but it won't.
It won't. I can't merge. Okay, cool.
I'll make sure that's priority for the guys to check on. And then how would you like to mark a call summary as handled?
Actually on here, every time I look through them and I think that screen over here.
So that. Sorry.
Yeah, so this has this nice little thing where, for example, it has this little check mark and I can just mark it as done and it pops it off the thing.
Do you like that?
Yeah, that's nice. Yeah. Okay, I handled it. So Marco's done and it just takes it off.
Sweet.
That was Kelsey calling the customer and leaving a voicemail, basically saying, hey, when are you going to open the shop? That's irrelevant to the job. So in Jobber, if I see it on the requests and it's like just that quick voicemail, it's irrelevant to the actual job. I just delete it. For example, go in here and then more and then delete or archive if it's some. If it's something that is somewhat relevant but not exactly part of the job, maybe we want to look back at it later than a lot of Archive it.
Sweet. Okay.
So, for example, this was my phone call with FD Fire confirmed that he only wants two roles. Technically it's relevant to the job, but not really. But he did tell me so. So I have to copy all of this because I can't merge anything. Copy. Go to FD Fire. Well, darn, it disappeared. There we go. Go to FTFire. Wait, there they are over here. Yep, that's the paper. Paste that request in here. Save that just so that we have a little log. Go back here. And then I don't need this anymore because it created a new request.
So you're just eliminating the redundant. Yeah.
So go in here. See, new request, but that's related to an existing job. So I. I can't merge it. There's no way to merge a request. You have to create a new thing.
So.
All right, so then I go in here and I delete this because I don't need it at this point.
Okay, cool. That's a perfect example of that. And we got that recorded, so that's even better if any. You. So you're happy with the call handle, marking calls? Is there anything you want to change to that? You just do you like it the way it is? You're happy with it? Like when you. How you archived or handled that call in qo, like, it seems like it's pretty legit. Like, you have that pretty handled, so.
Oh, yeah. When they call in. Yeah. Simple, straightforward.
If Kelsey's field updates Otto appeared in Jobber, how much time would that save? If Kelsey's field updates auto appeared in Jobber, So when Kelsey leaves the job and it automatically populates in Jobber, where he doesn't have to call you or any of that, it automatically shows what Kelsey did and how long he did it. Would that help you?
That would be awesome. But I don't know how that's going to.
Yeah, we're just trying to see if that would be helpful for you at all before.
Because currently. What's going on? Let me show you what is currently happening so that you have an idea why. I'm thinking about it, but I'm not sure. All right, so for example, this job. He should be there right now. There it is. His timer is going. He's currently there. It's key. Keeping track. We have had trouble with the timers, but it is keeping time. And then once he's done, he's going to add his notes to one of these. This area here. So what I do, I highlight this copy, paste it under the labor, put the date on here. So I'd be putting today's date, which is 2, 5. This is when he came out. And then I had his notes underneath. I'll update the hours, how long he's been there, and that's how we do that.
Then I need to add the surcharge because if they pay with credit card, Jobber takes a percentage from us. So we're gonna make the customer pay that.
Yeah. Okay.
And then I send the invoice.
Sweet.
Sometimes I'll double check with Kelsey, depending on how his notes look like. If there's something I don't understand. And I just want clarification. That's when those other calls come in.
Okay, that's a good one. So then moving on. For call routing, should new customers call go to you first or Kelsey? New customers, do they. Should they go to you first or Kelsey or call routing?
I feel like if it's a new color, it should be Kelsey. Because if they're asking about, hey, I want to purchase a printer, what's the best printer for me? I can't answer that.
Right.
I can ask them the general questions, which is, how many prints per day or per week are you doing? What's the volume? What kind of paper do you need? But I don't know what printer to recommend if it's just general supplies that can handle ink and paper.
But I'm wondering if we had like an ability to be like a customer profile and like, oh, yeah, I'm a contractor type contractor. Oh, what do you need it for? And he types of what do you need it for? And then it would. Because we're already going to be building your part one.
I'm thinking if there was. Sorry for interrupting. Yeah, no, it just came to my head. Before I forget about it, I'm thinking if there's like a call manual, like, they call in and it's like, what kind of service are you looking for? Sales service.
You like a script.
Yes. And they say new equipment. And then it can route it right to Kelsey or if it's Bayard.
So you're almost like. You're almost like pre screening the call. So if it needs to go to Kelsey, it can go to Kelsey. But if I can answer it.
Because if it goes to Kelsey, he's gonna try to answer that. He's gonna get overwhelmed.
Right, right. So we need to do that. Like, I think that would be good idea. And then, so. And to make you even better, and then be like, you know, because you don't know the technical side. And if you have this script and like, oh, yes. Yeah, I'm a contractor. I need to get this type of paper and I got to do these type of prints. And you have something where you, like, it's either you listening the phone or you can select and hone you into some options. And like, yeah. And then. And then like, yeah, this is what we have. If you want, I can schedule a time for our. Our.
Our.
Mechanic to call you. You know what I mean? Like, let's schedule Kelsey's time to get. Return that phone call. But at least the customer has Some sort of idea and have some sort of professional pipeline without having to disturb Kelsey. Because I think that's where the big problem is we keep directing phone calls.
So we have a service form Right. On our website.
Right, I did see that. But how cool would it be? Would it be to have, like, a knowledge base behind it?
You know, that would be great if.
I could just tell people to go here and like.
Yeah, if. Yeah, like you saw the little word document I was doing for each printer.
Yeah, if that was. If there was a way to incorporate that and the customers are pretty much doing 80 of the work. Work. And then you're there just to finish it off. Right? Yeah, yeah. Because then it would be cool. You, like, you'd be saving so much time and you get to actually do the fun things.
I'm not doing the research.
Yeah, exactly. Yeah. Okay. Should existing customer calls go to you first, I think we agree. I think, honestly, we need to make all the calls and you need to delegate, and I don't want all that to come on you. Well, there'll be a. Like, a way to manage that. Right?
Yeah.
Ultimately, we're just trying to find what ways we can think of that maximize the return on investment for plotter.
Yeah. Right.
And return on investment is time for not only you. For Kelsey. What's the number one thing that wastes your time every day? And is it the RMAs? Is that safe to say? The RMAs? Your time sinkers?
I feel like they are, because I just. I don't.
Is there any other else? Any other time sinkers?
Well, like I said, the. Researching.
Yeah, researching.
Yeah, researching. Because that's taking me away from everything else.
Right.
Something else that's taking my time away. I think those are the main two things.
Cool. We're almost there.
I can't do anything if, like, Kelsey and Megan are both calling me at the same time telling me to do two different things. That's. That's not really a time waster. That's just me trying to juggle things.
Right. We'll get you there. No worries. If we eliminate Kelsey's back and forth.
What do you mean eliminating Kelsey's back and forth?
I'm assuming they're. We're meaning by driving back and forth on driving. I don't know what that means. I'll have to get clarification.
Yeah, get a clarification on that.
I don't know if we. Kelsey's back and forth, so usually when.
He is driving, we set his calendar up so that it's A ding, ding, ding in one direction and then all the way back.
This jobber automate automatically create a driving optimization route.
Kind of. It actually does have this wonderful little map feature.
Yeah, Joe was Sure. I made Joe show it to me this morning.
Yeah. Where was it? This little map feature. There you go. You just zoom in. Sorry, I've got like.
No, you're fine.
Everything. Yeah, it's easier on the phone, but if, like.
That's so cool. Okay. So it shows you. Okay. Awesome. Interesting. Cool. I like that. If emails consolidated into two boxes. Time savings. We already went over that. If call summary is not all populated. How much faster? I think we. I think we already can estimate that. What time do you do? What do you do? What would you do with extra 5 to 10 hours of per week? If you. If we gave you time back to give back to plotter, what would you use that time to do?
Let's see. Well, for example, there's cleaning kits over there that I have yet to fill up because we're running low on them, which I haven't gotten to yet. Checking over inventory. I used to do that back when I wasn't the only one. That's more of like whenever I feel. See that something's getting low, then I grab my pen and paper and then start writing it down.
So you manually check the inventory.
I manually check the inventory.
Okay.
Or if Kelsey says, hey, we're running low on this. Yeah, usually that's really into the parts boxes, which are all up there.
Just maintaining the shop, it seems like.
Oh, yeah. I have not been maintaining the shop.
Like, just general. Like just being able to keep up with the. Because the. I think Kelsey even mentioned, like, he's like, this shop is a mess.
Yeah.
There's clutter. And it's just because you don't have the time to necessarily. To maintain that.
I try.
Yeah. I don't know. Honestly, I'm very impressed with you and Joe and how you guys. I'm like, I am very impressed that you guys. What you do and how you guys done it. Very impressed. I just want you guys to know that you guys are.
Maybe you can finally track down all the missing markers. I don't know how I ended up with two on my desk.
I originally had one and then my.
Pen went missing, so I had to grab a new one.
So we have a. I call those leprechauns.
Yeah. Yeah.
And then fast line of final question, if I gave you a magic wand.
Oh, this one again?
Yeah. Is there another anything else that you.
Would do, aside from reading Kelsey's mind.
Okay, let's see. I think we already.
Yeah, yeah. So let's see. Barcode is on the inventory. Or some way to keep track of them and link them to the pos Has Megan had.
So what's going on with the update on Megan integrating with Jobber and the inventory?
I think we need to figure out our inventory before anything can happen.
What's wrong with figuring out the inventory right now?
We don't know what we have.
And why don't. Is that why the shelves are here? So we can start the same.
Same issue as the RMA process. We don't have a way to keep track of it.
Okay.
We don't know which POS Everything's from. I can. I've been keeping track, but. Or trying to keep track. I mean, I've been saving all of the.
We'll see. I. I got a solution for that.
Yeah, it's that same issue. Basically, we're not doing well keeping track of our inventory. Every time I see that something's low, I will order it. But usually we don't know what we have in stock. And of course, you can't make a new inventory list if you don't know what you have in stock.
Right. Hey, Trent, are you there by any chance.
So, yeah, Magic Wand will probably be inventory.
Yeah, it seems like it.
Because currently, if somebody says, hey, I need a box of paper, 42 by 150, I have to say, I think we have them. Give me one moment, let me check. Put them on hold. Go over to the other office, check to see if we actually have it. So do you want 20 pound or 24 pound?
Yeah, and you go back. Right, right. Oh, gotcha.
I. I didn't know There was a 24 pound and that looked.
There is a 24 pound. Okay.
Do you want 20?
Let me. I'm just gonna put a message, see if the guys have any other questions.
I don't think we do.
I think this was a very cool. We are about ready to wrap up the meeting if anybody wants to jump. Okay.
Yeah. My inventory is a disaster. Where did I put QuickBooks? Disappeared. There it is.
Is there any. Do you have an existing inventory sheet? Even though it's not accurate, is there any existing inventory sheet that we can look at? Like, it's none.
I mean, if you want to look at paper, we can see what the last order was. No, there is no existing order sheets.
Not even. I mean, like, inventory sheet. Any order parts or like, you have nothing. No inventory sheet. Exists at all?
No.
Okay. Everything's done on paper.
Everything is POS. Or we're eyeing it because QuickBooks does not have the correct amounts of things because it. Before I got here, it was just never upkeep.
Well, okay, let me see if Kelsey's available real quick. I don't want to bug him because I know he's on a call.
Yeah, he's still on that job. It looks like he's stuck. Wait, well, if you go in here and like I said, yeah, L4 laser, and then you see his tone timer is still going. Sometimes it's off, sometimes it continues to go. Apparently he's still at that job. He might have left, but I don't see any notes.
Let's see. So I'm just gonna do. I'm just gonna test them real quick.
Yeah, yeah, go ahead.
I still see you're at the job site. Is that currently accurate? Are you still working on that? Yeah, I'm still working on it.
And I'm most likely not going to make it to the other job.
Well, I might make it there this.
Afternoon, but I might have to spend the night in Tucson. I'll be out of here probably within.
The hour, I'm hoping. Okay, well, I had a really good meeting with Joe, Alissa, and I'm gonna. I had a really good talk with Megan, Greg.
Oh, great.
What's the guy? Gus.

I had a really good talk with Gus. So I, I. Is there anything else you need me to do while I'm here? I mean, just make sure that Alissa.
Understands how to use quote and all that stuff.
We, we got, we had a really good meeting, man. We had a really good morning. I got some. We got, I got. We got some cool stuff coming in.
Okay.
Yeah, that's fine.
All right, brother. I got a pretty good handle over here. I'm gonna get. I'm gonna go talk to Gus real quick, and then I'll be here for about another maybe 30 minutes, 45 minutes.
