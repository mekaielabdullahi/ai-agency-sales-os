# Joe Interview - Stakeholder Questions (Phase 2 Update)

**Role:** Field Service Technician
**Interview Status:** Pending
**Estimated Duration:** 35-40 minutes
**Interviewer:** _______________
**Date:** _______________

**Phase 2 Deliverables This Interview Validates:**
- Training System ($18k) -- training time, methods, gaps, video priorities
- Equipment Management Platform ($10k) -- field tech perspective on customer device info
- Unified Chat Agent ($10k) -- would Joe use it, what would he ask
- Scaling Readiness -- Joe's growth path and potential as internal AI champion

---

## Context

Joe is a field service technician at Plotter Mechanix. He handles service calls including solo customer-facing work. He has 10 years of experience with cutters and has successfully completed independent jobs (including Apache Rental solo). Kelsey describes him as "really good" and says having Joe means "I can take five calls and turn five hours into 10 hours." Joe also speaks Spanish, which affects customer routing for Spanish-speaking leads.

**What We Already Know (from Jan 27 Kelsey call):**
- Completed Apache Rental job solo
- 10 years cutter experience
- Can handle independent customer-facing work
- Speaks Spanish (Kelsey sent him a Spanish-speaking lead)
- Chris wants to work closer with Joe for media/content (filming service calls)
- Kelsey's IVR routes "Printing" calls (option 4) to Joe

**What This Interview Needs to Validate:**
- Actual training time Kelsey spends with Joe (ROI assumption: 5 hrs/week)
- What training methods work and what gaps exist
- Joe's perspective on customer equipment info needs
- Whether a chat agent would help him in the field
- Whether Joe could be the internal AI champion for new tools
- His daily workflow and how he moves through a typical day

## Opening Framing

> "Hey Joe -- thanks for taking the time. We've heard great things about the work you're doing, including the Apache Rental job. We're building some new tools for the business and want to make sure they actually help you in the field. This should take about 35 minutes. Your honest answers help us build the right stuff."

|---|----------|----------------|-----------|--------|
| 4 | What's your technical background? Where did you work before Plotter Mechanix, and what equipment have you worked on over your career? | Full experience profile -- 10yr cutter experience is known, but we need the complete picture (brands, machine types, industries) | Training System scope + Scaling | |
| 5 | Kelsey mentioned you handled the Apache Rental job solo -- walk me through what types of jobs you handle on your own now. | Confirm current capability range beyond what Kelsey reported | Training System scope | |
| 6 | What types of calls or machines are you NOT comfortable handling solo yet? | Identifies training system content priorities | Training System ($18k) | |
