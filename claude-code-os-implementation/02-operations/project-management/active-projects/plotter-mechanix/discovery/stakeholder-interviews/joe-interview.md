## Context

Joed De La Cruz is a field service technician and print production specialist at Plotter Mechanix. He handles service calls including solo customer-facing work, plus CAD architectural printing production. He has 12+ years of experience with HP latex printers and cutters (self-taught since 2013/2014 in his dad's sign shop). Kelsey describes him as "really good" and says having Joed means "I can take five calls and turn five hours into 10 hours."

**What We Already Know (from Jan 27 Kelsey call):**
- Completed Apache Rental job solo
- 10+ years cutter experience
- Can handle independent customer-facing work
- Speaks Spanish (Kelsey sent him a Spanish-speaking lead)
- Chris wants to work closer with Joed for media/content (filming service calls)
- Kelsey's IVR routes "Printing" calls (option 4) to Joed

**What This Interview Validated:**
- Kelsey training time: 20-30 hrs/week initial → <10% currently (~2-4 hrs/week)
- Video library: Strong yes -- prefers video over in-person (self-paced)
- Flowchart/decision trees: Also validated as high-value format
- Chat agent: Would use it -- top queries are procedures, troubleshooting, post-repair steps
- AI champion: Strong fit -- already uses ChatGPT daily
- NEW: Shopify → Jobber unit mismatch causing under-deliveries 2-3x/month
- NEW: Morning planning/coordination with Kelsey is biggest daily frustration (changes 4/5 days)
- NEW: Joed sees printing as a major missed revenue opportunity

## Opening Framing

> Delivered by Mekaiel: "What's up, Joe? How's it going? Matthew's on the call, too. We heard a lot of good things about you and all the good work you're doing, especially with the Apache rental job. We're building in some new tools for the business, as you know, and we're here to just make sure they actually help you in the field. Today's call should take about like 30 minutes or so. Your honest feedback and answers help us build the right things."

## Priority 1 - Daily Workflow (5 min)

| # | Question | Why It Matters | Validates | Answer |
|---|----------|----------------|-----------|--------|
| 1 | Walk me through a typical day -- from when you start to when you wrap up. How do you get your schedule, how many jobs, what happens between jobs? | Baseline daily flow -- surfaces friction points, tool gaps, and time waste we can target | All deliverables | **Arrives 8-9 AM.** Unlocks office, turns everything on. (1) Checks email for CAD print jobs (~20 min setup, avg 3 sets/day, 30-120 pages/set). (2) Checks Jobber for schedule -- Alyssa usually preps night before. (3) Cross-references Shopify for paper/ink deliveries. (4) Plans with Kelsey -- routes get adjusted. **1.5-2 hours to get organized.** Then service calls. Returns to office end of day to prep for tomorrow. |
| 2 | How do you get dispatched to a job? Does Kelsey call you, does it come through Jobber, or something else? | Dispatch method reveals where automation and chat agent fit into existing workflow | Chat Agent ($10k) | **Jobber is primary dispatch.** Alyssa schedules jobs. But Kelsey frequently adds/changes jobs verbally in morning planning. Last-minute service calls get added throughout the day. Kelsey will call and say "go ahead and take care of it." |
| 3 | What's the most frustrating or time-wasting part of your day? | Open-ended pain point discovery -- may surface issues we haven't identified | All deliverables | **Morning planning and waiting for agreement.** "Even if it's in my schedule, sometimes it'll change up. Four days out of five." Waiting for Kelsey to confirm/change the plan. Also: Shopify → Jobber unit mismatch (boxes vs rolls) causes manual calculation errors and under-deliveries 2-3x/month, each fix ~2 hours. |

## Priority 2 - Tech Background & Capability (8 min)

| # | Question | Why It Matters | Validates | Answer |
|---|----------|----------------|-----------|--------|
| 4 | What's your technical background? Where did you work before Plotter Mechanix, and what equipment have you worked on over your career? | Full experience profile | Training System scope + Scaling | **Dad's sign shop since 2013/2014.** Self-taught HP latex printers and US Cutter. Software: Vinyl Master, Adobe Illustrator (3/5), Flexi (design + print), ChatGPT. Also does tech work at his church. No formal certifications -- all hands-on self-directed learning. |
| 5 | Kelsey mentioned you handled the Apache Rental job solo -- walk me through what types of jobs you handle on your own now. | Confirm current capability range | Training System scope | **Solo-capable:** General maintenance/exterior service, HP/latex printers (7-8 of 10 calls are HP), GravTech cutters, print head replacement, encoder strip + belt replacement, cartridge problems, print quality troubleshooting. Also handles full CAD print production workflow. |
| 6 | What types of calls or machines are you NOT comfortable handling solo yet? | Training system content priorities | Training System ($18k) | **Not comfortable:** Ink tubes/assemblies (margin for error), non-HP large format print heads (Muto, Mimaki, Epson), solvent printer interfaces, flatbed/UV curable printers. Two-person physical jobs (maintenance kit lifts). "I don't really like working with Epson because I'm not too familiar with it." |
| 7 | When you're on a job and get stuck, what do you do? Who do you call, and what info do you need from them? | Current escalation path + chat agent gaps | Chat Agent ($10k) | **Process:** (1) Pull out service manual -- studies beforehand, notes page numbers for quick access. (2) If still stuck, calls Kelsey. Uses remote desktop from phone to access office computer for procedures. "My last resort would usually just call Kelsey." |
| 8 | How often per week do you need to call Kelsey for help during a job? And roughly how long are those calls? | **ROI VALIDATION** | Training System ROI | **Minor redirect (figures it out):** 10-15% of service calls. **Truly stuck (calls Kelsey):** ~20% of service calls. **Fully solo:** 65-70% of calls. Much better than initial 3-month ramp where Kelsey spent 20-30 hrs/week (70% of time). Currently <10% of Kelsey's time. |
| 9 | Kelsey mentioned you speak Spanish -- how often do Spanish-speaking customers come up? Do you handle those calls? | Customer routing + unique value | Scaling / Routing | **Not directly asked in interview.** However, family background (dad's sign shop) and Vinyl Master software context suggests bilingual capability. Kelsey previously confirmed he routes Spanish-speaking leads to Joed. |

## Priority 3 - Training & Knowledge (7 min)
**Validates: Training System ($18k)**

| # | Question | Why It Matters | ROI Tag | Answer |
|---|----------|----------------|---------|--------|
| 10 | How did you learn the jobs you can do now? Walk me through how Kelsey trains you on a new repair. | Baseline training method | Training baseline | **Kelsey's method:** (1) Joed rides along, Kelsey explains how things work. (2) Kelsey has him try -- "go ahead, take this part out." (3) Sometimes Kelsey disassembles, Joed reassembles. All hands-on. **Joed's self-study:** Reads service manual beforehand, locks process in his head, notes page numbers for field reference. |
| 11 | How much time per week does Kelsey spend showing you things, reviewing your work, or helping you on jobs? | **CRITICAL ROI** | Training System ROI ($78k assumption) | **Initial 3 months:** 20-30 hrs/week (~70% of Kelsey's time). **Current:** "Less than 10%" -- estimated 2-4 hrs/week. **PROPOSAL IMPACT:** The 5 hr/week assumption is in the right ballpark for current state but trending down. Training System ROI should be reframed around the NEXT tech's 3-month ramp (20-30 hrs/week), not Joed's maintenance state. |
| 12 | If you had a library of 25-30 videos showing Kelsey doing common repairs, diagnostics, and customer interactions -- would you use it? What would be most helpful? | Video library adoption | Training System adoption risk | **"Yeah, definitely."** Prefers video over in-person with Kelsey: "Watching a video, slightly more better for me, because I'm able to just take it in on my own time. Kelsey's more fast-paced." Also **strongly endorsed flowcharts/decision trees** for troubleshooting: "That would be great, something really handy because that's usually the process I take internally." |
| 13 | What are the top 3-5 repairs or procedures you wish you had a video walkthrough for right now? | Video library content plan | Training System content | **Parts replacement procedures** (technical stuff -- the steps he's less confident on). **Troubleshooting decision trees** (yes/no steps to reach diagnosis). **Post-repair service mode steps** (what to do after replacing a part -- printer may be in service mode). Also mentioned: ink tube assemblies, non-HP large format procedures. |
| 14 | If a new tech started tomorrow, what would you tell them they need to learn first? | Onboarding priorities | Training System curriculum | **Start with HP -- most user-friendly,** everything more automated, 7-8 of 10 calls are HP. "Get to know the printer, because in general they work very similar." Would walk them through the office printers first (~1 day / 8 hours). Visual learning: watch HP do automated processes, then transfer that understanding to manual processes on other brands. |

---

## Priority 4 - Equipment & Pre-Job Information (5 min)
**Validates: Equipment Management Platform ($10k)**

| # | Question | Why It Matters | ROI Tag | Answer |
|---|----------|----------------|---------|--------|
| 15 | Before you go to a job, what information do you wish you had about the customer's equipment? | Pre-job info gaps | Equipment Platform | **Wants to know:** (1) What cutter or printer they have. (2) If they have OTHER equipment beyond what's listed. (3) Software they use. (4) What the business does. "Sometimes they'll have one printer [in Jobber] when in reality they have like four or five." |
| 16 | How do you currently find out what machine you're working on before you arrive? (Jobber notes? Ask Kelsey? Show up and see?) | Equipment info baseline | Equipment Platform baseline | **Jobber notes** (usually has printer/plotter listed + job description). Sometimes incomplete -- Kelsey gives verbal overview that doesn't make it into Jobber. For unfamiliar machines, downloads service manual or emails it to himself (~5 min). |
| 17 | How do you know what parts to bring? How often do you show up without the right parts? | Wasted trips | Equipment Platform + Ply ROI | **Not directly answered for parts.** However, Chris confirmed Joed can take photos of serial numbers and status pages in the field. Joed agreed printer status reports (meter readings, print head life) would be "really helpful" to capture. Equipment mismatch in Jobber sometimes means wrong prep. |
| 18 | Do you ever look up service history for a customer's machine? Where do you look? | Service history access | Equipment Platform | **"The client history is never on Jobber."** Has to ask Alyssa or ask the customer directly. If he didn't take the original call, relies on Alyssa for context. Call recordings (Quo) have been "a little helpful sometimes." |

---

## Priority 5 - Chat Agent & Field Tools (5 min)
**Validates: Unified Chat Agent ($10k)**

| # | Question | Why It Matters | ROI Tag | Answer |
|---|----------|----------------|---------|--------|
| 19 | When you're in the field and need to look something up -- a part number, a procedure, customer info -- how do you do it today? | Current lookup baseline | Chat Agent baseline | **Calls Alyssa** or **remote desktops into office computer from phone.** For procedures: pulls up service manual. For part numbers: takes pictures, adds to Jobber notes, looks up later at office. |
| 20 | If you had a tool on your phone where you could type or speak a question like "What equipment does ABC Graphics have?" or "Do we have an HP 730 printhead in stock?" -- would you use it? | Chat agent adoption | Chat Agent adoption | **"Yeah, I think so."** |
| 21 | What are the top 3 questions you'd want to ask that tool? | Chat agent features | Chat Agent features | (1) **Procedures on specific printers/plotters.** (2) **Troubleshooting steps and questions.** (3) **Steps after replacing a part** (service mode, calibration, etc.). |
| 22 | Do you use any apps on your phone for work right now? (Jobber app, texting, notes?) | Mobile comfort | Chat Agent UX | **Jobber app** (schedule, notes, voice dictation for field reports). **Remote desktop** to office computer. **ChatGPT** for image enhancement, Illustrator shortcuts, general questions. **Email** (sends service manuals to himself). Uses voice dictation regularly. |

## Priority 6 - Growth, Scaling & AI Champion (5 min)
**Validates: Scaling readiness, AI adoption, Training System ROI**

| # | Question | Why It Matters | ROI Tag | Answer |
|---|----------|----------------|---------|--------|
| 23 | What would help you get ready to handle more calls independently, faster? | Open-ended | Training System | **"Having a resource to go to where I could follow the troubleshooting issues or the steps before and after servicing the printer or cutter."** Also: more automation for Shopify → Jobber order flow. |
| 24 | Are there specific machine types or skills you want to learn next? | Training content roadmap | Training System content | **Design skills:** More Adobe Illustrator and Photoshop for printing side. **Software:** Flexi (design + print files). **Printing production:** Sees this as a major growth area for the business. |
| 25 | How do you see your role changing as the business grows? | Growth trajectory | Scaling strategy | **"Training other people, passing it down knowledge."** Very big on the printing side -- "I think there's a lot of opportunity there too." Sees himself as a trainer and print production leader. |
| 26 | We're building AI-powered tools for Plotter Mechanix -- a chat agent, training videos, equipment tracking. Are you someone who likes trying new tools and tech? Would you be interested in being the first person to test these and give us feedback? | AI champion fit | AI Champion / Adoption | **Not asked directly in this framing,** but validated indirectly. Already uses ChatGPT daily, comfortable with tech, does church tech work. Mekaiel told him post-interview: "You seem like the person we're going to need your feedback." Joed engaged positively. |
| 27 | Have you used any AI tools before? (ChatGPT, voice assistants, AI features in apps?) What was that like? | AI comfort level | AI Champion readiness | **ChatGPT -- daily use.** Image enhancement (8-9 out of 10 good results, saves "a bunch of time," 3-5 minutes per task). Illustrator shortcuts and questions. "I think I'm pretty good with technology." Also uses it for prompt-based workflows (specifying PNG, enhancement parameters). |
| 28 | If you were the go-to person for testing new tools before they roll out to the whole team, what would that look like for you? What would you need from us? | AI champion structure | AI Champion structure | **"The most efficient and beneficial things we could get out of it on a day-to-day basis."** Wants practical guidance on how to use tools most effectively. Low-maintenance -- doesn't need hand-holding, just clear instructions on value. |

## Priority 7 - Content & Filming (2 min)
**Validates: Training System ($18k), Chris content initiative**

| # | Question | Why It Matters | Answer |
|---|----------|----------------|--------|
| 29 | Chris mentioned wanting to film service calls for training videos. Would you be comfortable being filmed while working? | Training System filming consent | **Not asked directly,** but Chris told Joed post-interview: "I'll get that implemented where we can set up your workstation. I want to turn your workstation into a legit workstation." Joed responded positively. Chris committed to delivering camera + mic. |
| 30 | What types of jobs would be most useful to film? | Content planning | **Parts replacement procedures, troubleshooting processes, post-repair steps.** Cross-validated with Q13. Also: HP exterior service (most common, good for new tech training), encoder strip/belt replacement (Joed's confident process). |

### Spanish-Speaking Capability:
- Frequency of Spanish-speaking customers: Not directly validated in interview
- Current handling: Kelsey confirmed he routes Spanish-speaking leads to Joed

### Discovered Pain Points (Not in Original Questions):
- **Shopify → Jobber unit mismatch:** Shopify counts paper by BOX (2 rolls), Jobber by ROLL. Manual calculation causes under-delivery 2-3x/month. Fix: ~2 hours each. Verification: 15-20 min per order.
- **CAD file size mismatch:** 20% of the time, files have mismatched sizes. Adds 20 min to 3 hours of rework per incident.
- **Kelsey phone distractions:** During joint service calls, phone rings/deviations 80% of the time. 3-5 min recovery each. Joed's suggestion: train Alyssa to handle more calls.
- **Printing revenue opportunity:** Clients ask "do you guys print too?" on service calls. Kelsey sometimes declines (competition concerns). Joed thinks non-competing clients (tint shops, offices) are missed revenue.
- **Upsell awareness:** Inks and supplies already moving but "could be something pretty big."
- **Consumables not priced in:** Joed suspects Kelsey doesn't account for ink/print head/maintenance kit costs in CAD pricing.
