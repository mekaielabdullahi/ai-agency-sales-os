# Alyssa Interview - Stakeholder Questions

**Role:** Office Manager
**Interview Status:** Pending
**Estimated Duration:** 30 minutes

---

## Context

Alyssa handles scheduling, invoicing, customer calls, and Jobber management. She's the central hub for information flow but relies on handoff calls with Kelsey that often result in missed details. Takes notes on sticky notes during calls, then transfers to Jobber.

**Key Quote:**

> "Every day multiple things come in. Kelsey communicates to Alyssa... she takes notes on that call, then she'll go update Jobber. But some of the stuff will get missed and then they'll be back and forth."

**Already Gathered:**

- Phone provider account # and PIN for porting: **✅ Have it**
- Takes notes on sticky notes during handoff calls: **Confirmed**
- Information gets missed between call and Jobber entry: **Confirmed**

## Opening Framing

_Set the tone before diving into questions:_

> "
> From everything we've learned so far, you are the center of so many operations here - you're the glue that holds it all together. We're starting to understand your role from the outside, but we're really excited to understand your perspective from the inside out.
>
> We're here because we want to make your day better. We need your help to understand what's really going on.
>
> We appreciate what you do. We know there's a lot on your plate, and we want to understand everything that's going on in detail so we can best help the team and improve workflows in the business.
>
> We really appreciate your time today - we know you're going out of town tomorrow. Actually, what does time out of the office look like for you? How are they going to hold it all together without you there in person?

Follow up: And what will it look like for you when you get back?"
