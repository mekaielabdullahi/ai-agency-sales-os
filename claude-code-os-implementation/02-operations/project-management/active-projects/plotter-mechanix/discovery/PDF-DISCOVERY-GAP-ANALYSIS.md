- Joe has marketing responsibility = content creation partner
- Alyssa contact consolidation = data migration prerequisite

---

### 5. FINANCIAL DETAILS (QUANTIFIED)

**From PDF - QuickBooks Issues:**
- **$700,000 reconciliation error** last year
- Wife + bookkeeper currently fixing it
- **Fresh start January 1, 2025** (hard deadline)
- Goal: Clarify costs/margins to justify hiring $40/hr employee

**Remote Consulting Rate:**
- **$175 per remote consultation** (current files said $150-500, PDF has specific number)

**Current Files Status:** ⚠️ Mentioned QuickBooks issues, NOT $700K error magnitude

**Impact:**
- January 1 = critical milestone (financial reset)
- Any solution needs to be operational by Jan 1 or wait until after books are clean
- **$700K error = serious financial data quality issue**
- Hiring decision pending = capacity constraint if not resolved

---

### 6. TECHNOLOGY VISION - UNIFIED DASHBOARD (SPECIFIC)

**From PDF:**
> "The vision is a single dashboard consolidating all business data and hardware monitoring"

**Features Needed:**

- This is MORE complex than just CRM/QuickBooks integration

---

### 7. E-COMMERCE STRATEGY (NEW DETAILS)

**From PDF:**
- **Drop shipping integration** to remove handling bottlenecks
- Shopify + inventory + Jobber integration
- **Video marketing and social media promotion**
- Goal: Increase sales without increasing field service workload

**Current Files Status:** ⚠️ Mentioned e-commerce, NOT drop shipping model

**Impact:**
- Drop shipping = supplier API integrations needed
- Video marketing = content production workflow
- Sales growth without service growth = product sales focus
- Joe's social media role makes sense now

---

- **Labor tracking = time-and-motion study data collection**
- This feeds into pricing optimization (charge by task, not by hour)

---

### 9. NETWORKING/SUBCONTRACTOR MODEL (FORMALIZED)

**From PDF:**
> "Building a network of trusted contractors to supplement workload expands capacity"

**Current Model:**
- Kelce subcontracts at $150, charges customer $250 (already doing this)
- Markup on subcontracted work = additional revenue stream

**Current Files Status:** ✅ Mentioned subcontracting, ❌ NOT formalized network concept

**Impact:**
- Platform for contractor management
- Job distribution/marketplace feature
- Quality control/rating system
- Revenue sharing/payment automation

---

### 10. MARKETING APPROACH (VALIDATED)

**From PDF - Personal Networking:**
- Strategically visits neighboring businesses
- Leaves cards, nurtures leads
- Relationship-building drives repeat business
- **Competitive advantage:** Immediate response (no voicemail)

**Video Content Strategy:**
- Daily routines on wearable cameras = authentic marketing assets
- Informational videos about ink use/printer maintenance
- Social media + e-commerce integration

**Current Files Status:** ✅ Generally mentioned, ❌ NOT strategy specifics
