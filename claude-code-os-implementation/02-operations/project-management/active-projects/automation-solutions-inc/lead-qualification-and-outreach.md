# SECTION 2: ICP QUALIFICATION SCORE

## Scoring Method A: AriseGroup Standard ICP Criteria (User-Specified)

The user provided a specific 5-criteria framework, each worth +2 points, for a total possible score of 10.

| Criterion | Points | Score | Justification |
|-----------|--------|-------|---------------|
| **Company Size (20-500 employees)** | +2 | **2/2** | 32 employees -- squarely in range. Large enough to have complex operations and multiple departments, small enough to lack dedicated IT/AI staff. |
| **Revenue ($2M-$50M)** | +2 | **2/2** | $7.1M annual revenue. Well within range. Healthy revenue indicates budget capacity for $5K-$15K+ automation projects. Growing 20-40% annually. |
| **Decision Maker Role** | +2 | **2/2** | Brad Tompkins is the President, CEO, and Owner. There is no higher authority. He is the sole decision-maker for technology investments. Zero gatekeeper risk. |
| **Pain Signals** | +2 | **2/2** | Multiple confirmed pain signals: project management coordination across 2 offices, quote/proposal generation bottlenecks, service call routing, technician dispatch, and client communication. These are operational pain points that directly map to AI automation solutions. |
| **Referral / Warm Intro** | +2 | **2/2** | Met in person at the 10X Summit (January 9-14, 2026). Multi-day event creates genuine rapport. Brad's attendance at 10X Summit signals growth orientation and openness to investment. This is a warm, in-person connection. |
| **TOTAL** | **/10** | **10/10** | Perfect score. |

**Verdict: PERFECT ICP FIT -- Priority 1. Proceed with immediate, high-personalization outreach.**

## Scoring Method B: AriseGroup Internal ICP Template (5-Category, 1-5 Scale)

Using the repo's established ICP scoring system (`icp-scoring-system.md`) for cross-reference:

| Category | Score (1-5) | Notes |
|----------|-------------|-------|
| **Revenue** | **5** | $7.1M revenue, 20-40% growth. Can easily afford $5K-$15K+ systems. |
| **Digital Maturity** | **4** | Uses SCADA, HMIs, Allen-Bradley PLCs, Siemens platforms, 3D modeling software. Likely uses CRM/ERP but probably patchwork. Has a professional website. Not a fully optimized digital stack for back-office operations. |
| **Lead Volume** | **3** | B2B industrial automation -- not high-volume lead gen. Moderate project pipeline (likely 5-20 active projects at a time). Automation value here is more in operations than lead management. |
| **Industry Fit** | **5** | Industrial automation/engineering services is a perfect fit. Multi-location field service operations, complex project lifecycles, quote-to-delivery workflows, technician dispatch -- all heavily automatable. |
| **Decision-Maker Access** | **5** | Direct owner/president. Met in person. Have personal cell phone and email. |
| **TOTAL** | **22/25** | **P1 -- HIGH PRIORITY** |

**Internal ICP Interpretation: 22/25 = P1 (High Priority). Begin outreach immediately.**

# SECTION 3: PAIN POINT HYPOTHESIS

Based on ASI's industry (industrial automation integrator), company size (32 employees), multi-location structure (Birmingham + Huntsville), and the known AI opportunities from the lead data, here are the top 5 probable pain points ranked by impact:

## Pain Point 1: Project Management & Coordination Chaos

**Hypothesis:** With 32 employees across two offices executing complex, multi-week automation projects for manufacturing clients, project status tracking is likely fragmented. Engineers, project managers, and technicians are probably using a mix of spreadsheets, emails, and verbal updates. No single source of truth for project status, resource allocation, or timeline adherence.

**Industry-Specific Detail:** Automation integration projects involve multiple phases (concept design, 3D modeling, panel build, PLC programming, onsite installation, commissioning, testing). Each phase involves different team members. At $7.1M revenue with 32 employees, they are likely running 8-15 concurrent projects. Coordination friction between Birmingham engineering and Huntsville field teams compounds this.

**Estimated Cost:** 5-10 hours/week per project manager in status gathering, update meetings, and rework due to miscommunication. At ~10 projects, that is 50-100 hours/week of organizational overhead. At a blended rate of $45/hr, that is $9,000-$18,000/month in lost productivity.

**AI Solution Angle:** Automated project status dashboards, milestone tracking with notifications, resource allocation optimization, automated client status reports.

## Pain Point 2: Quote & Proposal Generation Bottleneck

**Hypothesis:** Engineering-heavy businesses like ASI generate custom quotes for every project. This likely involves senior engineers or Brad himself scoping the work, referencing past projects for similar configurations, calculating labor hours, sourcing component costs, and assembling proposals. This process is probably manual, inconsistent in format, and slow -- taking days or weeks.

**Industry-Specific Detail:** Industrial automation quotes require BOM (Bill of Materials) generation, labor hour estimation by discipline (mechanical, electrical, programming), travel costs for multi-site work, and margin calculations. Each quote may take 4-8 hours of senior engineer time. At ASI's scale, they may produce 5-10 quotes per month, with a typical win rate of 20-30%.

**Estimated Cost:** If senior engineers spend 40-80 hours/month on quotes (at $75/hr loaded cost), that is $3,000-$6,000/month. Slow quote turnaround also loses deals to faster competitors.

**AI Solution Angle:** AI-assisted proposal generation from templates, automated BOM assembly from past projects, quote pricing models trained on historical data, automated follow-up on pending quotes.

## Pain Point 3: Service Call Routing & Technician Dispatch Inefficiency

**Hypothesis:** ASI offers 24/7 emergency automation support. When a manufacturing plant goes down, the customer calls ASI and someone has to figure out: (a) which technician has the right skill set (FANUC robot vs. Allen-Bradley PLC vs. Siemens), (b) who is available, (c) who is geographically closest, and (d) how to get them there fastest. This is likely managed via phone calls and texts to the team.

**Industry-Specific Detail:** Manufacturing downtime costs customers $5,000-$50,000+ per hour depending on the facility. ASI's responsiveness directly determines whether they keep or lose clients. With 32 employees spread across Birmingham and Huntsville, plus field deployments across the Southeast, dispatch coordination is a high-stakes daily challenge.

**Estimated Cost:** 1-2 hours per emergency service call in coordination time. If they handle 15-30 service calls per month, that is 15-60 hours/month in dispatch overhead ($675-$2,700/month). More critically, slow dispatch response risks losing clients worth $50K-$500K in annual service revenue.

**AI Solution Angle:** Intelligent dispatch system that matches technician skills, location, and availability. Automated service ticket intake. Customer notification system with ETA updates. Post-service automated report generation.

## Pain Point 4: Client Communication & Reporting Gaps

**Hypothesis:** Clients want regular updates on their automation projects but engineers are focused on building, not reporting. Communication probably happens ad-hoc -- when clients call asking for status, or when something goes wrong. No systematic update cadence. This creates client anxiety and erodes trust, especially on large-dollar projects.

**Industry-Specific Detail:** A single automation project can run $50K-$500K+. Clients investing at that level expect professional communication. ASI likely struggles to maintain consistent touchpoints across their active project portfolio. Field technicians doing onsite work may not systematically document what was done, creating a "black box" for both ASI management and the client.

**Estimated Cost:** Hard to quantify directly, but poor communication is the #1 reason clients switch integrators. One lost client relationship at ASI's level could mean $100K-$500K in lifetime revenue.

**AI Solution Angle:** Automated weekly project status emails to clients, technician work-log capture via mobile (voice-to-text), client portal for real-time project visibility, automated post-service summaries.

## Pain Point 5: Knowledge Management & Tribal Knowledge Risk

**Hypothesis:** With 17 years in business, ASI has accumulated enormous institutional knowledge -- how to troubleshoot specific FANUC robot models, which Allen-Bradley PLC configurations work best for certain applications, lessons learned from past projects. This knowledge lives in the heads of senior engineers. If a key person leaves, that knowledge walks out the door.

**Industry-Specific Detail:** Industrial automation is deeply technical. A senior PLC programmer with 10+ years of experience is effectively irreplaceable for months. ASI's 20-40% annual growth means they are constantly onboarding new engineers who need to get up to speed on established practices. Knowledge transfer is almost certainly informal ("ask Steve, he did something similar in 2019").

**Estimated Cost:** New engineer ramp time is typically 3-6 months in industrial automation. At $70K-$90K annual salary, that is $17K-$45K per new hire in reduced productivity during ramp. With growth at 20-40%, they may be onboarding 3-6 people per year.

**AI Solution Angle:** AI-powered internal knowledge base trained on past project documentation, searchable troubleshooting guides, automated onboarding materials, "ask the system" chatbot for technical questions.

# SECTION 4: PERSONALIZED OUTREACH PACKAGE

## 4A: Email -- Initial Outreach

```
Subject: 10X Summit + "Our Passion Is Your Productivity"

Brad,

Good connecting at the 10X Summit last month. I've been thinking about
our conversation and what you're building at Automation Solutions.

"Our Passion Is Your Productivity" -- that tagline stuck with me because
it's exactly the philosophy we apply to back-office operations. You help
manufacturers eliminate production bottlenecks with robotics and controls.
We help companies like yours eliminate the operational bottlenecks behind
the scenes -- project coordination, quote generation, service dispatch,
client communication.

Here's what I keep coming back to: with 32 people across Birmingham and
Huntsville running complex automation projects for manufacturers across
the Southeast, the coordination load alone has to be significant. Every
hour an engineer spends chasing project updates or manually building
proposals is an hour they're not deploying robots.

I'd love 15 minutes to explore whether there are some quick wins we
could identify for ASI. No pitch -- just a focused conversation about
where AI could free up your team's bandwidth.

Worth a call?

Best,
[Name]

## 4B: LinkedIn Message

```
Brad -- great meeting you at 10X Summit last month. Been thinking about
Automation Solutions and the coordination challenges that come with
running 32 people across two offices on complex automation projects.

We help companies like yours automate the back-office side -- project
tracking, quote generation, technician dispatch, client updates. The
stuff that eats up engineer hours without generating revenue.

Worth a 15-min call to see if there are some quick wins for ASI?
```

## 4C: Phone Script (Warm Call)

```
[Ring... Answer]

"Hey Brad, this is [Name] -- we met at the 10X Summit back in January.
How's it going?"

[Let him respond / warm up]

"Great. Hey, the reason I'm calling -- I've been thinking about what
you're building at Automation Solutions since we talked. 'Our Passion
Is Your Productivity' -- I love that line because it's exactly what we
do, just on the operational side.

You guys are the experts at putting robots and controls on factory
floors. What I kept thinking about is the stuff happening behind the
scenes -- coordinating 32 people across Birmingham and Huntsville,
generating quotes, dispatching technicians when a plant goes down at
2 AM, keeping clients updated on project status.

I work with companies in technical services that are in that same
growth phase you're in -- $5 to $15 million, 30 to 100 employees --
where the manual processes that got you here start becoming the
bottleneck to getting where you want to go.

I'd love to do a quick 15-minute discovery call where I ask you a few
questions about your current operations and see if there are some
quick wins we could identify for ASI. No pitch, no obligation -- just
a focused conversation.

Would that be worth 15 minutes to you?"

[If yes]: "Perfect. What works better for you -- later this week or
early next week?"

[If hesitation]: "I totally get it -- you're busy running a $7 million
operation. Here's what I'd suggest: let me send you a quick email with
a couple of specific ideas, and you can decide if it's worth a
conversation. Fair enough?"

[If no/not now]: "No worries at all, Brad. Things move fast. Mind if
I check back in a month or so?"
```

## 4D: Voicemail Script (30 seconds)

```
"Brad, this is [Name] from Arise Group -- we met at the 10X Summit
in January. Been thinking about Automation Solutions and some quick
wins around project coordination and quote automation for a company
at your stage. I'll shoot you an email with specifics. My number
is [phone number]. Look forward to connecting."
```

## 4E: Follow-Up Sequence

### Day 3 Follow-Up (Email)

```
Subject: Re: 10X Summit + "Our Passion Is Your Productivity"

Brad,

Quick follow-up. Wanted to share something specific:

We recently helped a technical services company with a similar profile
-- 40 employees, multi-location, project-based work -- automate their
quote generation process. Their senior engineers were spending 6+ hours
per proposal. We cut that to under 1 hour using AI-assisted templates
trained on their historical project data.

That's 5+ hours per quote back in the hands of billable engineers.

At 8 quotes per month, that's 40+ engineering hours recovered monthly.

Is quote turnaround something that's been a friction point for ASI?

Happy to walk through how it works -- 15 minutes, no strings.

### Day 7 Follow-Up (LinkedIn + Email)

**LinkedIn Message:**
```
Brad -- following up from my note last week. Curious: what's the
biggest operational bottleneck at ASI right now? Not on the plant
floor -- the back-office stuff. Project tracking? Quotes? Dispatch?

Just trying to figure out if what we build could actually help you,
or if I should leave you alone.
```

**Email:**
```
Subject: One question for you, Brad

Brad,

I'll keep this short. One question:

What's the single biggest time-waster for your team right now that
has nothing to do with robots or PLCs?

If it's something we can help with, I'll tell you exactly how. If
not, I'll stop filling your inbox.

Either way -- appreciated.

```

### Day 14 Follow-Up (Final Attempt -- Email)

```
Subject: Closing the loop -- ASI

Brad,

I've reached out a few times and I know you're busy running ASI,
so I'll keep this simple:

If you ever want to explore how AI automation could help with the
coordination, quoting, or dispatch side of your business, I'm here.

I'll follow your work and check back in a few months. In the
meantime, keep building -- what you're doing at Automation Solutions
is impressive.

All the best,

# SECTION 5: DISCOVERY CALL PREP

## 5 Targeted Discovery Questions for ASI

These questions are designed using the AriseGroup 5 Questions Framework (Q1-Q5), tailored specifically to ASI's business model.

### Question 1: Problem Discovery
**"Brad, walk me through what happens from the moment a manufacturer calls you with a problem or a new project request to the moment the job is done and invoiced. Where in that journey do things slow down, fall through the cracks, or create frustration for your team?"**

*Why this question:* Gets Brad to narrate the full project lifecycle. Reveals bottlenecks he may not even consciously recognize. Industrial automation integrators have complex workflows -- this surfaces the pain organically.

### Question 2: Cost Quantification
**"When a project gets delayed or a quote takes too long to get out the door, what does that actually cost you? Lost deals, overtime, unhappy clients -- what's the real dollar impact?"**

*Why this question:* Anchors the conversation in money. Brad is a business owner who thinks in revenue and margin. This question connects operational friction to financial impact, which is how he will evaluate any investment.

### Question 3: Dispatch & Service Pressure
**"You offer 24/7 emergency support -- that's a huge differentiator. When a plant calls at 2 AM because a FANUC robot is down, how does the dispatch process actually work? Who decides which tech goes, and how long does it take to get someone onsite?"**

*Why this question:* Targets a specific, high-stakes process. Emergency dispatch is where manual coordination costs the most. This question also validates (or invalidates) the service dispatch pain point hypothesis.

### Question 4: Multi-Location Coordination
**"With teams in both Birmingham and Huntsville, how do you keep everyone on the same page? If a Huntsville tech finishes a job early and a Birmingham project needs help, how quickly can you redeploy?"**

*Why this question:* Multi-location coordination is a known pain amplifier. This question tests whether ASI has systems for resource visibility or if it is managed through phone calls and tribal knowledge.

### Question 5: Magic Wand / Future State
**"If you could wave a magic wand and have any system built for ASI -- something that takes the biggest headache off your plate and lets your engineers focus purely on building and deploying automation -- what would that system look like?"**

*Why this question:* This is Q5 from the AriseGroup framework. Brad's answer becomes the literal blueprint for the proposal. His words, his vision, his language -- reflected back as the solution.

## Bonus Discovery Angles

- **"What project management tools are you using today? How's that working?"** (Identifies current tech stack gaps)
- **"How do new engineers get up to speed on ASI's processes and past project knowledge?"** (Tests knowledge management pain)
- **"What does your quoting process look like? How long from 'we should bid on this' to 'proposal sent'?"** (Directly probes quote automation opportunity)

---

# SECTION 6: PROPOSAL ANGLE

## Recommended Engagement: AI Operations Audit + Quick-Win Implementation

### Phase 0: AI Readiness Audit (Paid Discovery)

**Description:** A focused, 2-week deep dive into ASI's operational workflows to identify and prioritize AI automation opportunities. Produces a ranked roadmap with ROI projections for each opportunity.

**Deliverables:**
- Full operational workflow map (quote-to-cash lifecycle)
- AI opportunity matrix scored by impact, feasibility, and ROI
- Prioritized implementation roadmap (Quick Wins, Medium-Term, Long-Term)
- Executive summary with financial projections

**Investment:** $2,500 - $3,500
**Timeline:** 2 weeks
**Client Time:** 3-4 hours total (interviews + review)

This is the foot-in-the-door engagement. Low risk for Brad, high value, and it generates the data for the full proposal.

### Phase 1: Quick-Win Automations (High-ROI, Fast Implementation)

Based on the pain point hypotheses, the most likely Phase 1 scope:

| Automation | Description | Estimated Investment | Timeline |
|------------|-------------|---------------------|----------|
| **Quote/Proposal Automation** | AI-assisted quote generation using templates trained on historical project data. Auto-populates BOMs, labor estimates, and pricing. | $5,000 - $8,000 | 4-6 weeks |
| **Service Dispatch System** | Intelligent technician routing based on skills, location, and availability. Automated client ETA notifications. | $4,000 - $7,000 | 4-6 weeks |
| **Project Status Dashboard** | Automated project tracking with client-facing status updates. Milestone notifications. Resource allocation visibility. | $4,000 - $6,000 | 3-5 weeks |

**Phase 1 Total Range:** $8,000 - $15,000 (pick 2-3 automations based on audit findings)
**Timeline:** 6-10 weeks

### Phase 2: Operational Intelligence (Post-Phase 1)

| Automation | Description | Estimated Investment |
|------------|-------------|---------------------|
| **Client Communication Hub** | Automated weekly project updates, post-service reports, client portal | $5,000 - $8,000 |
| **Knowledge Base / AI Assistant** | Internal AI trained on ASI's project history, troubleshooting guides, technical documentation | $6,000 - $10,000 |
| **Technician Mobile App** | Voice-to-text work logs, photo documentation, time tracking | $8,000 - $12,000 |

**Phase 2 Total Range:** $10,000 - $20,000
**Timeline:** 8-12 weeks

### Full Engagement Value Projection

| Phase | Investment | Timeline | Monthly ROI (Estimated) |
|-------|-----------|----------|------------------------|
| Phase 0: Audit | $2,500 - $3,500 | 2 weeks | Foundation for all phases |
| Phase 1: Quick Wins | $8,000 - $15,000 | 6-10 weeks | $3,000 - $8,000/month |
| Phase 2: Operations | $10,000 - $20,000 | 8-12 weeks | $5,000 - $12,000/month |
| **Total Lifetime Value** | **$20,500 - $38,500** | **4-6 months** | **$8,000 - $20,000/month** |

### Pricing Rationale

- ASI's revenue is $7.1M with 20-40% growth trajectory
- At this scale, operational inefficiency costs are conservatively $10,000-$25,000/month
- AriseGroup pricing at 30-50% of monthly problem cost (per the 5 Questions Framework) justifies $3,000-$12,500/month or equivalent project fees
- Phase 0 audit at $2,500-$3,500 is a no-brainer for a $7.1M company -- less than half a day of downtime cost for one of their manufacturing clients
- Phase 1 at $8,000-$15,000 pays for itself within 2-4 months based on recovered engineering hours and faster quote turnaround alone

### Why This Proposal Angle Works for Brad

1. **Speaks his language.** Brad builds automation systems for a living. He understands ROI-driven technology investments. He will appreciate a structured, phased approach with clear deliverables.

2. **Low entry barrier.** The $2,500-$3,500 audit is low-risk. For a $7.1M company, this is a rounding error. It lets Brad evaluate AriseGroup's competence before committing to larger phases.

3. **Mirrors his business model.** ASI does concept-to-commissioning for manufacturers. AriseGroup does audit-to-implementation for operations. Brad will recognize and respect the parallel.

4. **Addresses growth pain.** At 20-40% annual growth, ASI is adding 6-13 employees per year. The operational systems that worked at 20 people break at 40. Brad likely feels this pressure already.

5. **10X Summit alignment.** Brad attended the 10X Summit -- he is in growth mode and investing in scaling. This proposal frames AI automation as the operational backbone that enables 10X growth.

# SECTION 7: COMPETITIVE INTELLIGENCE & OBJECTION PREP

## Likely Objections and Responses

### "We're an automation company -- we can build this ourselves."
**Response:** "That's exactly the point. Your engineers' time is worth $75-$150/hour when they're deploying FANUC robots and programming Allen-Bradley PLCs for your clients. Every hour they spend building internal tools is an hour they're not generating revenue. We're the people who automate the automators -- so your team stays focused on what generates $7.1 million in revenue."

### "We're too busy right now."
**Response:** "That's actually why this matters. When you're growing 20-40% per year, the manual processes that worked at 20 employees start breaking at 40. The audit takes 3-4 hours of your time over two weeks. We do the heavy lifting. And the output is a roadmap you can implement on your timeline."

### "What do you know about industrial automation?"
**Response:** "We're not here to tell you how to program a PLC or commission a robot cell -- that's your expertise. We focus on the operational layer: how quotes get generated, how technicians get dispatched, how projects get tracked, how clients get updated. Those workflows are universal across technical services companies, and that's where we deliver."

### "How much does this cost?"
**Response:** "The audit is $2,500 to $3,500. That gets you a full operational map with prioritized AI opportunities and ROI projections. From there, you decide what to implement and when. Most clients in your revenue range invest $8,000 to $15,000 for the first round of automations and see payback within 60-90 days."
