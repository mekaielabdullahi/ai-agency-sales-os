# Product Requirements Document (PRD): The "Lot Assistant" Integrated Shed Sales System

## 1. Executive Summary

The Lot Assistant (also referred to as the S&S Shed Sales System) is a proactive customer intelligence ecosystem designed to transform traditional shed dealerships into data-driven operations. Initially conceived as an interconnected 7-sheet workbook, the system's goal is to eliminate manual friction in sales, quantify marketing ROI, and solve the "last-mile" delivery problem. The product evolution involves migrating this relational data model from a static spreadsheet to a cloud-hosted Firebase/Firestore application for real-time, multi-user access.

## 2. Target Audience & User Roles

| Role | Responsibilities |
|------|------------------|
| **Admins/Managers** | Monitor pipeline health, financial performance, and marketing ROI |
| **Sales Representatives** | Capture leads on the lot, generate quotes, and manage deal stages |
| **Delivery Drivers** | Access site-specific intelligence (maps, hazards, gate codes) via secure, filtered mobile links |
| **Customers** | Access transparent pricing and product specs via QR codes on physical units |

## 3. Functional Requirements (The 7-Sheet Architecture)

The system is built on seven core functional modules, originally designed as workbook tabs:

### Sheet 1: Master Shed Data (The Foundation)
A centralized inventory log for all base models, including Model ID, base prices (stored as pure numbers), features, and picture links.

### Sheet 2: Pricing Lookup Tool (The Configurator)
A user interface that pulls data from Sheet 1 via VLOOKUP based on a Model ID. It calculates the Total Quote Price by adding base prices and selected options.

### Sheet 3: Optional Features Data
A database of all upgrades (e.g., metal roofs, extra windows) and their corresponding prices.

### Sheet 4: CRM & Sales Pipeline (The Hub)
The central log for all leads and sales stages. It requires Data Validation (Dropdowns) for "Pipeline Stage" and "Source" to ensure data integrity.

### Sheet 5: Customer Profile & Delivery Notes
A log for sensitive delivery instructions, such as gate codes or site hazards (e.g., wash and pooling at project entrances).

### Sheet 6: Financial Performance Dashboard
An automated reporting engine calculating Cost Per Lead (CPL), Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC), and Return on Ad Spend (ROAS).

### Sheet 7: Operational Cost & CODB Calculator
A financial anchor that itemizes fixed and variable costs to determine the Cost Per Shed Sold (CODB).

## 4. Key Technical Features

### Physical-to-Digital Bridge
Every shed on the lot is equipped with a weather-resistant QR code that links to the digital configurator, pre-loading the specific Model ID for the customer.

### The "Lot Assistant" Intelligence Engine
Uses Firebase to track "scan events," logging the session ID, product ID, and timestamps to profile customer interest in real-time.

### Geofence Trigger
Detects when a customer leaves the dealership geofence, triggering an automated summary text or email of the buildings they scanned most often.

### Secure Driver Access
Generates a unique, filtered Driver Delivery Link from the CRM, allowing drivers to see only the logistics notes for their specific assigned job.

## 5. Success Metrics (KPIs)

| Metric | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Value-to-Cost Ratio** | Quantifies the revenue generated by the system per dollar of consulting fees paid (Target: demonstrate high ROI to the client) |
| **ROAS** | Measures revenue generated per dollar spent on specific marketing channels (e.g., Facebook Ads) |
| **Conversion Rate** | The percentage of lot scans or website inquiries that transition to "Won" deals |
| **CODB (Cost of Doing Business)** | Ensures the business maintains profitability by including overhead in every sale |

## 6. Implementation Roadmap

| Phase | Focus | Deliverables |
|-------|-------|--------------|
| **Phase I** | Database Foundation | Build the Master Data and Options Data structures |
| **Phase II** | Core Workflow | Establish the CRM Pipeline and Pricing Lookup interface, implementing mandatory dropdowns |
| **Phase III** | Proprietary Intelligence | Implement the CODB Calculator, Financial Dashboards, and the secure Driver Link logic |
| **Phase IV** | Firebase Migration | Transition the spreadsheet logic into a secure, multi-user cloud application with geofencing and real-time tracking |

## Summary

> The Lot Assistant is like a digital concierge for the dealership; while a physical salesperson can only talk to one person at a time, this system "walks" with every customer on the lot, quietly taking notes and remembering exactly what they liked so the business can follow up at the perfect moment.
