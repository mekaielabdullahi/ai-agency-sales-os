# **The Opportunity**

Every organization has processes that drain time, introduce errors, and limit growth. The challenge isn't knowing AI can help — it's knowing **where to start** and **which opportunities will deliver real ROI**.

This AI Opportunity Assessment gives you clarity. In 2-3 weeks, you'll move from uncertainty to a validated roadmap — with prioritized opportunities, quantified business impact, and a clear path to implementation.

# **What You Get**

This engagement delivers actionable outcomes, not just recommendations:

| Prioritized AI Opportunities | A clear view of where AI will have the greatest impact — mapped by business value and implementation effort so you know exactly what to tackle first. |
| :---- | :---- |
| **Quantified ROI Projections** | Data-backed business cases for each opportunity, including projected cost savings and revenue impact — the numbers to make confident decisions. |
| **Implementation Roadmap** | A sequenced plan showing what to implement first, dependencies, and realistic timeframes — move from assessment to action immediately. |
| **Executive Presentation** | A polished deliverable ready for leadership alignment — the complete story from current challenges to recommended solutions. |

**Plus Quick Wins Delivered During Assessment:**

| Initial SOPs | Documented processes for lead handling and lot operations — capturing your team's knowledge in repeatable, trainable formats. |
| :---- | :---- |
| **Website Quick Fixes** | Broken images repaired, mobile issues fixed, load times improved — professional first impression restored. |
| **Lead Qualification System** | Interactive "Find which shed is best for you" questionnaire replacing basic contact form — pre-qualify leads before they consume your time. |

# **Our Approach**

The foundation of a successful AI initiative is understanding your business from the inside out. Our goal is to become an **"inefficiency detective"** — uncovering the hidden friction, repetitive tasks, and manual processes that drain time and resources.

## **Discovery Interviews**

We conduct targeted interviews with two key groups: **leadership** to understand strategic goals and how success is measured, and **end-users** to understand the on-the-ground reality of daily tasks. The gap between these two perspectives is often where the biggest opportunities lie.

| Who | Duration | What We Learn |
|-----|----------|---------------|
| Sandy (Owner) | 60 min | Revenue, pricing, lead flow, close rate |
| Matthew (Operations) | 60 min | Operating costs, CODB validation |
| Alex (Website) | 60 min | Traffic data, inquiry patterns |
| Scott (Transportation) | 60 min | Delivery data, build error frequency |

## **Process Mapping (Ops Canvas)**

Interview insights are translated into a visual Ops Canvas that maps your core operations. For each process, we identify and tag friction points:

* **Time Sinks:** Tasks that are highly manual, repetitive, and consume significant employee time

* **Quality Risks:** Steps prone to human error or inconsistencies

These tagged items are your goldmine — every single one represents a potential opportunity for an AI solution.

## **Opportunity Prioritization**

Each identified pain point is evaluated and plotted on our Opportunity Matrix based on two dimensions: **Business Impact** and **Implementation Effort**. This creates an instant visualization of which AI projects to tackle first.

| Quick Wins | Low effort, high impact. Your #1 priority — fast value, builds trust and momentum. |
| :---- | :---- |
| **Big Swings** | High effort, high impact. Transformative projects for after quick wins are in place. |
| **Nice-to-Haves** | Low effort, low impact. Minor efficiency gains — good for extra value, not the focus. |
| **Deprioritize** | High effort, low impact. Time/money pits to avoid — identifying these is part of our value. |

## **Collaborative Validation**

The Opportunity Matrix is a powerful hypothesis, but it's not final until validated against your deep internal knowledge. We schedule a follow-up session to review the matrix together as a collaborative workshop — by the end, we'll be presenting a plan that we've already agreed on together.

# **Engagement Overview**

This focused engagement runs 2-3 weeks and delivers both the strategic assessment and immediate quick wins you can see working right away.

| Phase 1: Scoping | Collaborative session to identify and align on the highest-priority processes for assessment. |
| :---- | :---- |
| **Phase 2: Discovery** | Stakeholder and end-user interviews (~60 min each) to understand workflows, pain points, and opportunities. Process mapping to visualize operations and identify time sinks and quality risks. |
| **Phase 3: Quick Wins** | Website fixes deployed, lead qualification system live, initial SOPs documented — tangible value delivered during the assessment. |
| **Phase 4: Solution Design** | Opportunity prioritization, ROI analysis, roadmap development, and collaborative validation with your team before final executive presentation. |

# **Investment**

| AI Opportunity Assessment | **$5,000** |

| 2-3 week engagement | Includes quick wins delivery |

# **Why Arise AI Group**

Arise AI Group is an AI Transformation Partner helping organizations convert manual work into revenue-generating systems. We don't just build AI — we help you identify where AI will have the greatest impact and guide you through implementation.
