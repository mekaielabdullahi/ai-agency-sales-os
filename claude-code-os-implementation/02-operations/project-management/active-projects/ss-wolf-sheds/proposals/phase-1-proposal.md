# S&S Wolf Sheds — Phase 1 Foundation Sprint

## Proposal

**Prepared For:** Sandy Williams, S&S Wolf Sheds
**Prepared By:** Arise AI Group LLC
**Date:** January 4, 2026

---

## Executive Summary

S&S Wolf Sheds is a family-owned portable building company serving Northern Arizona from three lot locations. Through our discovery process, we identified four critical gaps preventing growth:

1. **No baseline metrics** — Operating on estimates, can't prove ROI
2. **Website credibility issues** — Broken images, mobile problems losing visitors
3. **Scattered data** — No single source of truth for inventory or costs
4. **Zero lead capture** — Website visitors leave without being tracked

**Phase 1 establishes the foundation** before building advanced systems. You can't automate chaos—first we need clean data, validated metrics, and basic infrastructure.

| | |
|---|---|
| **Investment:** | $5,000 |
| **Timeline:** | 2 weeks |
| **Potential Annual Value:** | $172,330 |
| **Projected ROI:** | 3,347% |

## The Problems

### Problem 1: Flying Blind Without Data

You're making business decisions based on estimates. Your CODB is "about $400/day" but unvalidated. Without baseline metrics, you can't:
- Prove ROI on any investment
- Measure if changes are working
- Know your actual profitability

### Problem 2: Website Killing Credibility

Visitors see broken images, blank spaces, and a website that doesn't work on mobile. First impressions matter—prospects leave before they ever call.

### Problem 3: Data Scattered Everywhere

Inventory and pricing data lives in multiple spreadsheets with inconsistent formatting. This causes:
- Pricing errors and margin loss
- Time wasted searching for information
- No foundation for automation

### Problem 4: Losing Every Website Visitor

Your website has **0% lead capture rate**. Visitors leave without any way to follow up. When you paused ads, leads dropped 75%—because there's no system to capture organic interest.

## The Solution: Phase 1 Foundation Sprint

### Deliverable 1: ROI Assessment & Stakeholder Interviews

We interview your key people to gather real numbers:

| Who | Duration | What We Learn |
|-----|----------|---------------|
| Sandy (Owner) | 30 min | Revenue, pricing, lead flow, close rate |
| Matthew (Operations) | 20 min | Operating costs, CODB validation |
| Alex (Website) | 15 min | Traffic data, inquiry patterns |
| Scott (Driver) | 15 min | Delivery data, build error frequency |

**Output:** Validated ROI Calculator with YOUR numbers, not estimates.

### Deliverable 2: Initial SOPs

From the interviews, we document two critical processes:
- **Lead Handling SOP** — How inquiries should flow from first contact to sale
- **Lot Operations SOP** — Standard procedures for lot management

### Deliverable 3: Website Quick Fixes

| Issue | Fix |
|-------|-----|
| Broken/blank images | Audit and repair all product pages |
| Mobile problems | Responsive CSS, cross-device testing |
| Slow load times | Image compression, lazy loading |
| Local SEO | Northern AZ schema markup |

**Result:** Professional first impression, mobile-friendly, faster loads.

### Deliverable 4: Database Foundation

We set up a clean, centralized data system:
- **Master Shed Data** — All products in one place
- **CODB Calculator** — Your actual operating costs
- **CEO-owned** — You control the account, not us

**Data Standards:** snake_case naming, pure numbers (no `$` symbols in data fields).

### Deliverable 5: Customer Onboarding Form

A mobile-friendly form that captures:
- Name, email, phone
- What they're interested in
- Timeline (ready to buy vs. browsing)
- How they found you

**Deployed on:** Homepage, contact page, product pages

**Result:** Sales team notified within 5 minutes of every submission.

### Deliverable 6: Validation Workshop

At the end of Week 1, we review findings together and confirm priorities before Week 2 build.
