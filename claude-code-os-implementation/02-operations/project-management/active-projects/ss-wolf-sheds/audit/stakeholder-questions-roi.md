### Chris A (Advisor)

**Operations Assessment:**
1. ✅ Biggest operational waste identified (Dec 28):
   - On-lot lead leakage (single attendant can't capture multiple visitors)
   - Lack of lot analytics (no footfall vs close rate data)
   - Last-mile delivery friction (drivers lack site specifics)
   - Missed upsell revenue (no structured path for ancillary services)

2. ✅ Processes needing SOPs (Dec 28):
   - Lead-to-delivery documentation
   - Checklists at plant pickup
   - Catch misbuilds before delivery
   - Daily dealer accountability checklist (Dec 30)

3. ✅ Bottlenecks preventing scale to $50k/month (Dec 30):
   - No accountability system for multiple locations
   - Sandra managing by driving ("I'm driving my ass off")
   - No way to ensure brand standards across locations

**Expansion Readiness:**
4. ✅ Infrastructure for Kayenta: Building from backyard (electrical done, needs insulation/drywall), security cameras, gated setup (Dec 30)

5. ✅ Accountability gaps (Dec 30):
   - No daily check-in system
   - No way to verify tasks completed
   - No deposit verification process
   - Security cameras but no systematic monitoring

## Key Quotes from Discovery (Supporting ROI)

### On Lead Leakage (Dec 28 - Chris)
> "A lot of the issues that they talked about is, like, sometimes if there's 15 people, or 10 people, or five people at a dealership and we only have one attendant, right? Who's to say that out of that five people, one of them was able to slip away without even being noticed, right? And I'm trying to capture those guys."

### On Build Errors (Dec 22)
> "~5-6 errors out of ~40 orders last year. Door/window sides/swings built incorrectly. Causes rebuilds adding 2+ weeks. High reputational cost - one lost expansion worth ~$24k via word-of-mouth damage."

### On Managing Multiple Locations (Dec 30 - Sandra)
> "Yes, I do. It's called a vehicle. I'm driving my ass off."

### On Scaling (Dec 30 - Chris)
> "But the way we do that is by creating these systems. So then it's just a copy and paste and then we hire the right people."

### On ROI Expectation (Dec 30 - Chris)
> "So you're going to turn 10,000 back into 10,000 in six weeks... Eventually that 10,000 is going to be made back in a week, two weeks. Now that 10,000 is making you 15,000 in four weeks. 20,000 in six weeks."

### On Traffic Baseline (Dec 28 - Chris)
> "We have three years or two years worth of historical sales that we can reference off of."

### On Close Rate (Dec 28 - Trent asking Chris)
> "Do you have any estimate or account of how many people show up and don't buy? A current way to calculate the close versus sale rate?"
> Chris: "Yeah. No."
