**Created:** January 3, 2026
**Phase:** 1 of 4 - Foundation Sprint
**Investment:** $5,000
**Timeline:** 2 weeks
**Framework:** Liam Ottley 3-Step AI Audit (adapted for implementation)

## Executive Summary

Phase 1 establishes the business case and operational foundation before building advanced systems. The **ROI Assessment** is the quick win that delivers immediate value while producing the baseline metrics needed for all future phases.

---

## Liam Ottley Framework Alignment

This phase maps to **Step 1: Discovery Interviews** of Liam's 3-Step AI Audit Framework.

|------------------|-------------------|--------|
| Stakeholder Interviews (30,000-ft view) | Sandy + Matthew interviews | ✅ Planned |
| End-User Interviews (ground-level) | Alex + Scott interviews | ✅ Planned |
| 3-5 interviews, 30-45 min each | 4 interviews (~90 min total) | ✅ Aligned |
| Record calls with permission | Use Fathom/Fireflies.ai | ✅ Planned |
| 80/20 listening rule | Documented in best practices | ✅ Added |
| Ops Canvas (3 Engines) | Mapped below | ✅ Added |
| Validation Workshop | End of Week 1 with Sandy | ✅ Added |

---

## 3 Engines Mapping (Ops Canvas)

Per Liam's framework, all opportunities map to one of three business engines:

| Engine | Description | Phase 1 Opportunities |
|--------|-------------|----------------------|
| **ACQUISITION** | How they find and sign customers | P1-WEB (Website), P1-FORM (Lead Capture) |
| **DELIVERY** | How they deliver product/service | P1-DB (Inventory Foundation) |
| **SUPPORT** | Customer questions and post-sale | (Phase 3+) |

### Phase 1 Engine Focus: ACQUISITION + DELIVERY Foundation

## Phase 1 Opportunities

### P1-ROI: ROI Assessment & Stakeholder Interviews

**Status:** ★★★★★ WEEK 1 QUICK WIN
**Quadrant:** ⭐ Quick Win (Low Effort, High Impact)
**Engine:** Cross-functional (feeds all engines)

| Attribute | Detail |
|-----------|--------|
| **Problem Addressed** | Shooting in the dark without baseline metrics; can't prove ROI without knowing starting point; no standardized processes documented |
| **Solution** | Structured stakeholder interviews to gather financial/operational baseline AND document current processes |
| **Impact** | HIGH - Client understands their own numbers; trust built through collaborative discovery; immediate SOP value |
| **Effort** | LOW - No development required; 4 interviews (~90 min total) |
| **Investment** | Part of Phase 1 ($5,000) |
| **Dependencies** | Stakeholder availability |
| **IP Risk** | LOW - Interview process, not proprietary data |
| **Timeline** | Week 1 |

#### Interview Structure (Liam Ottley Method)

| Type | Interviewee | Role | Focus | Duration |
|------|-------------|------|-------|----------|
| **Stakeholder** | Sandy (Owner) | Leadership | 30,000-ft view: Revenue, goals, strategic challenges | 30 min |
| **Stakeholder** | Matthew (Williams) | Operations | 30,000-ft view: Costs, processes, bottlenecks | 20 min |
| **End-User** | Alex (Website) | Ground-level | Daily reality: Traffic, inquiries, frustrations | 15 min |
| **End-User** | Scott (Driver) | Ground-level | Daily reality: Delivery issues, build errors | 15 min |

#### Interview Best Practices (Liam's Rules)

| Rule | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **80/20 Listening** | You talk 20%, they talk 80%. Your job is to understand, not pitch. |
| **Record Everything** | Use Fathom or Fireflies.ai. Get explicit permission first. |
| **Ask "Why?" Repeatedly** | When you find a pain point, dig deeper: "Why is it done that way?" |
| **Focus on Problems** | Don't suggest solutions yet. Understand the pain first. |
| **Get Specific Numbers** | "How long?" "How many?" "How often?" Vague answers don't build ROI. |
| **Capture Exact Quotes** | Write down powerful statements verbatim for presentations. |

#### Deliverables

| Deliverable | Description | Status |
|-------------|-------------|--------|
| Sandy Interview | Revenue, pricing, lead flow, close rate | ⬜ Pending |
| Matthew Interview | Operating costs, payroll, time tracking | ⬜ Pending |
| Alex Interview | Website traffic, social data, repetitive inquiries | ⬜ Pending |

#### Why This Is THE Quick Win

1. **Immediate Value** - Client learns their own business better (valuable even if we did nothing else)
2. **No Development** - Just structured conversations; can happen immediately
3. **Builds Trust** - Collaborative discovery, not sales pitch
4. **Dual Output** - ROI data + SOPs from same interviews
5. **Foundation** - All future ROI claims based on THEIR numbers

#### Interview → Output Mapping

| Stakeholder | Type | Duration | ROI Output | SOP Output |
|-------------|------|----------|------------|------------|
| Sandy (Owner) | Stakeholder | 30 min | Revenue, pricing, close rate | Lead Handling SOP |

| Alex (Website) | End-User | 15 min | Website traffic, lead sources | Repetitive inquiry patterns |
| Scott (Driver) | End-User | 15 min | Delivery data, build errors | Lot Operations SOP |

#### Validation Workshop (End of Week 1)

Per Liam's framework, after interviews we **validate findings with stakeholders** before finalizing.

**Attendees:** Sandy, Chris (if available)
**Duration:** 30-45 minutes
**Format:** Collaborative review, not a pitch

**Questions to Ask:**
- "Looking at these pain points, which resonate most strongly?"
- "Are there any hidden complexities we might have missed?"
- "Which improvements would your team embrace vs. resist?"
- "Does this align with your priorities for the next 6-12 months?"

**Outcome:** Agreed-upon priorities before presenting final roadmap.

#### Success Metrics

- [ ] All 7 data gaps in ROI Calculator filled
- [ ] CODB validated (currently $400/day estimate)
- [ ] 2 initial SOPs created
- [ ] Validation workshop completed with Sandy

## ROI Justification (Liam Ottley Method)

### Known Reference Points (From Discovery)

| Factor | Value | Source |
|--------|-------|--------|
| Build error cost | $24,000 lost sale | Dec 22 Discovery |
| Build error frequency | 5-6 per 40 orders/year | Dec 22 Discovery |
| Lead drop after pausing ads | 75% decline | Dec 22 Discovery |
| Current lead capture rate | 0% | Dec 28 Meeting |
| Current monthly revenue | ~$20,000 | Dec 30 Meeting |
| Target monthly revenue | $50,000 | Dec 30 Meeting |
| Average shed sale | ~$5,000 | Dec 22 Discovery |
| Close rate (estimated) | 25% | To be validated |

### Part 1: Direct Cost Savings (Liam's Method)

| Improvement | Calculation | Annual Impact |
|-------------|-------------|---------------|
| SOPs prevent 1 build error | 1 error × $24,000 | **$24,000** |
| Website fixes reduce bounce | (Unmeasured until baseline) | TBD |
| Database reduces pricing errors | (Estimated 2 hrs/week saved) | **$2,080** |

**Total Direct Savings:** $26,080/year

### Part 2: Revenue Uplift (Liam's Method)

This is the "hidden opportunity" - time saved becomes revenue-generating time.

```
Step 1: Calculate Hours Saved
- Form automation saves: 5 hrs/week (manual lead tracking)
- Website fixes save: 2 hrs/week (fixing issues, explaining broken images)
- Database saves: 2 hrs/week (pricing lookups)
- TOTAL: 9 hrs/week saved

Step 2: Estimate Reallocated Hours (50% to revenue activities)
- 9 hrs × 50% = 4.5 hrs/week available for sales

Step 3: Calculate Revenue Value Per Hour
- Average sale: $5,000
- Hours to close a deal: ~2 hrs (lot visit + follow-up)
- Value per hour: $5,000 ÷ 2 = $2,500/hr

Step 4: Calculate Annual Revenue Uplift
- 4.5 hrs × $2,500 × 52 weeks = $585,000 potential
- Conservative (25% of potential): $146,250/year
```

**Revenue Uplift (Conservative):** $146,250/year

### Phase 1 ROI Summary (Money Slide Preview)

| Solution | Investment | Direct Savings | Revenue Uplift | Total Value | ROI |
|----------|-----------|----------------|----------------|-------------|-----|
| ROI Assessment | $1,500 | $24,000 | - | $24,000 | 1,500% |
| Website Fixes | $1,000 | TBD | $36,500 | $36,500 | 3,550% |
| Database Foundation | $1,500 | $2,080 | $73,000 | $75,080 | 4,905% |
| Onboarding Form | $1,000 | - | $36,750 | $36,750 | 3,575% |
| **TOTAL** | **$5,000** | **$26,080** | **$146,250** | **$172,330** | **3,347%** |

*Note: Revenue uplift is POTENTIAL - requires validation with actual data from interviews.*

**Total Phase 1 Investment:** $5,000
**Potential Annual Impact:** $172,330 (conservative)
**ROI:** 3,347% (to be validated with actual data)
