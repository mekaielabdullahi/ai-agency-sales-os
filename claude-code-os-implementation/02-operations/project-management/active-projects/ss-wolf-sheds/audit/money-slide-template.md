**Purpose:** ROI justification slide for client presentations
**Created:** January 4, 2026

## How to Use This Template

The Money Slide is the most important slide in your client presentation. It shows:
1. **Investment** - What they're paying
2. **Direct Savings** - Time savings converted to dollars
3. **Revenue Uplift** - Additional revenue enabled
4. **Total Value** - Combined annual impact
5. **ROI** - Return on investment percentage

---

## Money Slide Formula (Liam's Method)

### Direct Savings Calculation

```
Weekly Hours Saved × Hourly Rate × 52 weeks = Annual Direct Savings

Example:
- 10 hours/week saved on manual tasks
- $40/hour labor rate
- 10 × $40 × 52 = $20,800/year direct savings
```

### Revenue Uplift Calculation (50% Rule)

```
Hours Saved × 50% → Revenue-Generating Time × Value Per Hour × 52 weeks

Example:
- 10 hours/week saved
- 50% = 5 hours redirected to revenue activities
- $500 value per revenue hour (based on avg sale)
- 5 × $500 × 52 = $130,000/year revenue uplift
```

## Presentation Script

### Opening (30 seconds)

> "Let me show you the ROI breakdown for your complete transformation. This is based on the data we gathered during our discovery process."

### Walking Through the Slide (2 minutes)

> "Here's what you're investing: $32,500 total across all four phases.
>
> **Direct savings** - this is the time your team won't spend on manual tasks anymore. We calculated 43 hours per week saved, which at $40/hour equals $136,000 per year.
>
> **Revenue uplift** - this is the additional revenue you'll generate. The geofence system alone recovers 20 leads per month that would have walked away. The accountability app enables your Kayenta expansion. Combined, we project over $824,000 in new annual revenue.
>
> **Bottom line**: You invest $32,500 and get back $960,000 in the first year. That's a 2,855% return with a 12-day payback period."

### Close (30 seconds)
