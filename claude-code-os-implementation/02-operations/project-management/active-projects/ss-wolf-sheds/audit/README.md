## Quick Reference

### Primary Pain Point
**On-lot lead leakage** - Single attendant cannot capture multiple simultaneous visitors. Prospects browse and leave without contact captured.

### MVP Scope (P0)
1. QR/Slot system: 20 fixed slot QR codes per lot
2. Website intake form with instant attendant notifications
3. Lead-to-building tracking
4. Basic scan analytics

### Key Stakeholders
- **Chris Andrade** - Owner/Operator, primary champion, GC license via Remus Development
- **Sandra** - Owner, dealership operations
- **Alex Bomyea** - Website/SEO

### Platform Vision
Prove value at S&S, then roll out to ~6 Arizona Graceland dealers (Chris knows all personally).

## Anti-Hallucination Rule

All data in these artifacts comes from discovery calls and client communications. No fabricated ROI numbers or assumptions. When uncertain, items are tracked in `discovery-unknowns.md` for follow-up.
