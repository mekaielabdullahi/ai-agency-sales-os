## ROI Model: Phase 1 Investment ($5,000)

### Phase 1 Deliverables
1. Database Foundation (Master Shed Data, CODB Calculator)
2. SOP Generator (Operational Playbooks)
3. Website Quick Fixes (Images, Mobile, SEO)
4. Customer Onboarding Form (Lead Capture)

### Projected Impact Areas

#### 1. Lead Capture Improvement

| Metric | Current | After Phase 1 | Savings/Gain |
|--------|---------|---------------|--------------|
| Lead capture rate | ❓% | ❓% | ❓ leads/month |
| Website form submissions | 0 | ❓/month | New leads |
| Response time to leads | ❓ hours | < 5 minutes | Faster close |

**ROI Calculation:**
```
Additional leads captured × Average sale value × Close rate = Revenue gained
❓ leads × $❓ × ❓% = $❓/month
```

#### 2. Operational Efficiency (SOPs)

| Metric | Current | After Phase 1 | Savings |
|--------|---------|---------------|---------|
| Time answering repetitive questions | ❓ hrs/week | ❓ hrs/week | ❓ hrs saved |
| Inconsistent customer experience | Yes | No | Reduced churn |
| New hire onboarding time | ❓ days | ❓ days | Faster ramp |

**ROI Calculation:**
```
Hours saved × Hourly labor cost × 52 weeks = Annual savings
❓ hrs × $❓/hr × 52 = $❓/year
```

#### 3. Website Credibility (Quick Fixes)

| Metric | Current | After Phase 1 | Impact |
|--------|---------|---------------|--------|
| Broken images | Yes | Fixed | Trust restored |
| Mobile experience | Poor | Good | Better conversion |
| Local SEO ("sheds near me") | Weak | Improved | More organic leads |

**ROI Calculation:**
```
Website conversion improvement × Current traffic × Average sale = Revenue gained
❓% improvement × ❓ visitors × $❓ = $❓/month
```

#### 4. CODB Visibility (Financial Anchor)

| Metric | Current | After Phase 1 | Impact |
|--------|---------|---------------|--------|
| Know daily operating cost | ⚠️ Estimate | ✅ Exact | Better pricing |
| Know cost per shed sold | No | Yes | Margin protection |
| Know break-even point | No | Yes | Informed decisions |

**ROI Calculation:**
```
Margin improvement per unit × Units sold = Additional profit
$❓ × ❓ units/month = $❓/month
```

## Known ROI Reference Points

### Build Error Cost (Validated)

One build error resulted in:
- **Direct loss:** $24,000 expansion sale walked away
- **Indirect cost:** 2+ week delay, rebuild labor, reputation damage

**If SOPs prevent just 2 build errors per year:**
```
2 errors × $24,000 average impact = $48,000 saved
ROI on $10,000 investment = 380%
```

### Lead Volume Impact (Estimated)

75% lead drop after pausing $400/month ads suggests:
- Ads were generating significant lead volume
- Without capture system, leads were already leaking
- With capture + ads: potential 4x lead volume

**If 10 additional captured leads convert per month:**
```
10 leads × 25% close rate × $5,000 avg sale = $12,500/month
Annual: $150,000 additional revenue
ROI on $10,000 investment = 1,400%
```

## Revenue Growth Target Validation

| Metric | Current | Target | Gap |
|--------|---------|--------|-----|
| Monthly Revenue | $20,000 | $50,000 | $30,000 |
| Required Growth | - | 150% | - |

**Path to $50k/month:**
1. Fix website → Restore credibility
2. Add lead capture → Stop leakage
3. Resume ads → Drive traffic
4. SOPs → Scale to Kayenta hub
5. Accountability system → Multi-location ops

## Stakeholder Validation Required

Before finalizing ROI projections, the following must be validated with stakeholders:

- [ ] Daily operating cost breakdown (Sandy/Matthew)
- [ ] Average sale price and margin (Sandy)
- [ ] Current lead volume and close rate (Sandy)
- [ ] Hours spent on repetitive tasks (All)
- [ ] Website traffic baseline (Alex)
- [ ] Failed delivery frequency (Scott)

**See:** [Stakeholder Questions for ROI](./stakeholder-questions-roi.md)

## Anti-Patterns (What We Won't Do)

- ❌ Guess baseline metrics
- ❌ Promise ROI without validated data
- ❌ Use industry averages instead of their numbers
- ❌ Skip the qualification question

---

## Next Steps

1. Complete stakeholder interviews with ROI questions
2. Populate "❓" fields with actual data
3. Run scenarios (conservative, moderate, aggressive)
4. Present ROI calculator to Sandy with HER numbers
5. Let the numbers make the case
