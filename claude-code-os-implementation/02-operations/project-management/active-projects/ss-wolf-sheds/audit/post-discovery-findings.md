## Findings Summary

### Confirmed Findings

| Original Finding | Status | Source |
|-----------------|--------|--------|
| Website has broken embeds and mobile UX issues | CONFIRMED | Chris - image rendering issues mentioned |
| Need for 24/7 lead capture | CONFIRMED | Chris - on-lot lead leakage is #1 priority |
| Delivery coordination friction | CONFIRMED | Chris - drivers lack site specifics |
| Analytics gaps prevent data-driven decisions | CONFIRMED | No footfall-to-conversion metrics |
| Family business with distributed operations | CONFIRMED | Chris parents operate dealership/delivery |

---

### Contradicted/Corrected Findings

| Original Finding | Correction | Source |
|-----------------|------------|--------|
| **Primary pain = paused ads causing lead collapse** | CORRECTED: Primary pain is **on-lot lead leakage** - visitors leave without capture | Chris (Dec 28) |
| **Quick win = AI chatbot for FAQ automation** | CORRECTED: Quick win = **QR/slot system for on-lot capture** | Chris prioritized this as MVP |
| **Sandra is primary decision maker** | CORRECTED: **Chris Andrade** is primary buyer/champion | Chris driving MVP decisions |
| **Budget = $5k quick win + $5k Phase 2** | NUANCED: Marketing budget mentioned ($2.5k/mo ads), MVP budget not yet specified | Chris (Dec 28) |

---

### New Information

| New Fact | Source | Impact |
|----------|--------|--------|
| Chris has GC license via Remus Development | Chris | Enables contractor services upsell |
| 300-page "Source of Truth" document exists | Chris | Requires AI processing for MVP extraction |
| ~20 buildings per lot is typical inventory | Chris | Defines QR slot count |
| Single entry/exit at lots | Chris | Enables camera-based traffic counting |
| 2-3 years of historical sales data available | Chris | Baseline for measuring improvement |
| Graceland builder tool emerging | Chris | Future option for quoting |
| White-label marketing option (Krista Green) | Chris | $1k/mo wholesale, resale $1.2-2.8k |
| Long-term vision: platform for Graceland network | Chris | Changes engagement from one-off to platform |

---

### Nuanced Findings

| Original Finding | Additional Context |
|-----------------|-------------------|
| **Repetitive FAQ time drain** | NUANCE: This is secondary to on-lot capture. FAQs matter but QR system is higher priority. |
| **Paid ads caused traffic collapse** | NUANCE: On-lot traffic was never captured even before - the real issue is capture, not just traffic volume. |
| **Website rebuild needed** | NUANCE: Patch now + intake form for immediate value, full revamp later. Not blocking on rebuild. |
| **Build error prevention via SOPs** | NUANCE: Still valid but de-prioritized vs on-lot capture MVP. May be Phase 2+. |

### Internal-Only Notes

- Chris appears more technical and hands-on than original discovery suggested
- Family dynamics: parents operate dealership, Chris drives strategy
- Aggressive timeline ("MVP by Friday if defined") - signals high engagement
- Platform vision for Graceland network is significant long-term opportunity
- 300-page SOT needs AI processing - potential scope creep risk

- [x] ADD: On-lot visitor flow (browse → scan QR → intake form → attendant notification → follow-up)
- [x] ADD: QR slot management process (inventory change → remap slot → update backend)
- [x] ADD: Delivery handoff artifact process (customer → site specs → driver link)
- [x] MODIFY: Lead generation flow to include on-lot QR capture channel
- [x] MODIFY: Analytics section to include traffic counting and scan metrics

### Discovery Unknowns Updates

- [x] RESOLVED: How many buildings per lot? → ~20 per lot
- [x] RESOLVED: Website access availability? → Ready "whenever"
- [x] RESOLVED: Entry/exit configuration? → Single entry/exit (supports counting)
- [x] RESOLVED: Historical data available? → 2-3 years of sales
- [x] NEW: What's in the 300-page SOT v1?

## Key Insights for Proposal

### Changed Understanding

1. **This is not a marketing engagement** - it's an operational efficiency / lead capture system
2. **On-lot capture is the #1 priority** - not chatbots, not paid ads
3. **Chris Andrade is the champion** - not Sandra (she may still be involved but Chris drives)
4. **Platform potential exists** - success here could lead to Graceland network rollout
5. **Aggressive timeline** - client wants MVP by Friday if scope clear

### Hidden Blockers

1. **300-page SOT document** - needs AI processing, could delay MVP definition
2. **Excel dependencies** - may have external refs/macros blocking migration
3. **Graceland portal limitations** - read-only access may constrain integration
4. **Website CMS access** - needs to be granted before any fixes

### Engagement Considerations

1. **Scope creep risk** - 300-page SOT + platform vision could expand endlessly
2. **Timeline pressure** - "by Friday" is aggressive; manage expectations
3. **Technical complexity** - QR/slot system + CRM + notifications is non-trivial
4. **Multiple stakeholders** - Chris, parents, Graceland network, our team

### Quick Wins Validation

| Original Quick Win | Status | Notes |
|-------------------|--------|-------|
| AI Chatbot | DEPRIORITIZED | Not MVP - consider Phase 2 |
| Resume Paid Ads | DEPRIORITIZED | Capture first, then drive traffic |
| Website Fixes | MODIFIED | Merge with intake form implementation |
| Analytics Dashboard | PARTIALLY VALID | Traffic counting is in scope; full dashboard Phase 2 |
| Order Verification SOP | DEPRIORITIZED | Not in MVP scope |

### New Quick Wins (MVP Scope)

1. **QR Slot System** - 20 fixed QR codes per lot with backend mapping
2. **Website Intake Form** - Guided capture with instant notifications
3. **Attendant Alerts** - Email/SMS on form submission
4. **Lead-to-Building Tracking** - Link scans to specific inventory

## Proposal Implications

### Pricing Considerations

- MVP scope is more technical than original chatbot proposal
- QR system + CRM + notifications requires development work
- Potential for ongoing revenue if platform vision materializes
- Consider: fixed MVP price + monthly platform/maintenance fee

### Risk Mitigation

- Define MVP scope tightly before committing to timeline
- Process SOT with AI to extract requirements efficiently
- Get website access before making delivery commitments
- Set expectations on "by Friday" - may need more time

### Upsell Path

1. **MVP:** QR capture + intake + notifications
2. **Phase 2:** Full CRM, traffic counting, analytics dashboard
3. **Phase 3:** Contractor services integration, Graceland network rollout
4. **Ongoing:** White-label marketing services ($1.2-2.8k/mo)
