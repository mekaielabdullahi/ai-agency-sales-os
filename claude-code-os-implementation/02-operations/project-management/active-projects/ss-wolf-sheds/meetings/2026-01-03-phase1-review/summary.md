---

## Phase 1 Deliverables Reviewed

Team walked through each Phase 1 opportunity:

### P1-ROI: ROI Assessment + Stakeholder Interviews
- **Validated:** Immediate value, no development required, builds trust
- **CODB Discussion:** Client estimated $400/day - team will validate actual cost through interviews
- **SOP Count:** Changed from "2 initial SOPs" to "initial SOPs" - don't commit to specific number until assessment complete
- **Success Metrics:** 7 data gaps filled, CODB validated, initial SOPs created

### P1-WEB: Website Quick Fixes
- **Validated:** Broken images, mobile issues, slow load times need fixing
- **Context:** Chris received email from host guy with notifications issue - confirms website needs attention

### P1-DB: Database Foundation
- **Problem Validated:** Data is scattered across spreadsheets (confirmed by Chris)
- **Firebase Concern:** Chris raised IP ownership concerns with Firebase - team noted but not choosing platform yet
- **Clarification:** Firestore reference in doc needs updating - solution TBD, problem statement is accurate
- **Technical Education:** Trent explained snake_case and whitespace concepts to Chris

### P1-FORM: Customer Onboarding Form
- **Correction Needed:** Document says "0% capture rate" but form exists and functions
- **Enhancement Opportunity:** Transform basic form into sophisticated lead qualifier
- **Sandy's Requirement:** Wants personal, family-business messaging around data collection

## Key Strategic Insights

### Lead Qualification System (Major Discovery)

Team identified a significant opportunity beyond the original Phase 1 scope:

1. **"Find which shed is best for you" Questionnaire**
   - Replace simple contact form with interactive qualification process
   - Questions to identify: product type needed, installation requirements, customer profile
   - Example questions from Chris: "Do you need a shed, garage, or shipping container? Do you need a road graded? Do you need dirt hauled in?"

2. **Ideal Customer Profile Development**
   - Collect baseline questions from EVERY customer (not just leads)
   - Build data to identify who buys multiple sheds, biggest purchases, best to work with
   - Incentivize participation: free coffee from local Flagstaff shop

3. **Delivery Pre-Qualification**
   - Customers often can't get the building size they want due to property access
   - Current $150 assessment visits lose money on distant customers
   - Vision: Let customers submit photos/video for remote pre-qualification

### SOP Generator Vision (Phase 2+)

- Phase 1: Create initial SOPs manually from stakeholder interviews
- Phase 2: Give client their own SOP generator tool
- Platform options: Claude skills, ChatGPT, or custom solution
- Key insight from Trent: "They're not gonna know how to iterate upon it" = recurring revenue opportunity

### Quick Wins Philosophy

Matthew emphasized: "We should always consider the simplest approach"
- Google Sheets/Docs for initial tracking before building custom tools
- Don't build for no reason - validate need first
- Stop-gap solutions give time to build final solution

## Document Corrections Identified

| Item | Issue | Resolution |
|------|-------|------------|
| P1-FORM problem statement | Says "0% capture rate" | Form exists and works - update to focus on enhancement |
| P1-DB solution | References Firebase/Firestore | Remove specific platform - TBD after evaluation |
| SOP count | Says "2 initial SOPs" | Change to "initial SOPs" - count TBD |

## Cross-Client Application

- Stakeholder interview questions being refined for use with Plotter Mechanix (Tuesday meeting)
- Process validated on S&S Wolf Sheds can be applied to other clients

- **Data collection:** Start immediately to have 1.5-2 months of baseline before campaigns
