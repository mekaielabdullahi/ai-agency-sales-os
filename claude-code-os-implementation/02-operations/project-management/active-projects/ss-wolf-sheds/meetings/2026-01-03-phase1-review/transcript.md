## Transcript Notes

@Chris Andrade [0:05]: On. Hey babe, I don't really know how long it's gonna take, but can we not help you with the hand. And that it comes down to and I don't foresee it, but just in case.

@Chris Andrade [2:02]: For the departure gap We need To really hone in on opportunities, because that is the last impression. That is where we make Them come back.

@Chris Andrade [2:19]: That is where we turn our client. To a friend I need you to identify 10 opportunities to Create

@Chris Andrade [2:38]: Memories of their experience. For instance I would Make sure I knew what time they plan on leaving before the day even

@Chris Andrade [2:56]: Started I would Make sure they had coffee in the morning. And then Inquire about it I would also ask what time would you like me to have a bellman here to pick up your luggage.

@Chris Andrade [3:19]: Then the bellman will ask Are you leaving right away, or would you like me to bring your car up at a later time. Then I would call down to the front desk.

@Chris Andrade [3:36]: And let them know that Mr. and Mrs. Smith is coming down. Can you please have their bill ready and also give them a complimentary Breakfast to the Cafe

@Chris Andrade [4:01]: What up, Trent

@Trent [4:03]: How to get served

@Chris Andrade [4:06]: Stop. Yeah, cause. It's all coming together, my man.

@Trent [4:15]: Oh yeah, just keep plugging away, it will. It will

@Chris Andrade [4:26]: I, I'm trying to finish up this prompt real quick.

@Chris Andrade [5:18]: OK.

@Chris Andrade [5:50]: Mhm What Right

@Chris Andrade [6:23]: 000. Matthew, what up

@Matthew Kerns [6:30]: That's a

@Chris Andrade [6:31]: I

@Trent [6:31]: Good up put up

@Chris Andrade [6:33]: Trying to finish his prompt real quick.

@Matthew Kerns [6:36]: OK Figure to jump in, see what's going on. See if I could help

@Chris Andrade [6:45]: Turn my camera on You got your camera on, I got turn my camera.

@Matthew Kerns [6:49]: Are you feeling any better, Trent

@Trent [6:50]: That's right. Yeah, it's a little better, but it's like one of those things that Like work and work and work and not sleeping too well, so. I have to Push through

@Matthew Kerns [7:03]: Yeah

@Trent [7:05]: We'll see

@Matthew Kerns [7:05]: Gotcha.

@Chris Andrade [7:06]: Vitamin C Remember we put on the Oh wait, no, I did not take her passing.

@Trent [7:16]: If my vitamin C you mean coffee. Yes. Lots of golf

@Chris Andrade [7:23]: I don't know how much nutrient content there is in in that, my friend.

@Trent [7:30]: Yeah, I don't think there was a lot.

@Chris Andrade [7:37]: OK. Oh Oh Dude, this is gonna dope. OK. All right So what do I, do you wanna pull that up on your computer there, Mr. Trent?

@Trent [7:54]: Sure Mhm mhm

@Trent [8:20]: All right Proposal We agree on this, we'll move to proposal generation and PRD drafting. OK.

@Trent [8:37]: The next one is Workbook one and the documentation generated phase 2 Through 4 draft matrices. Key ROI questions.

@Trent [8:54]: Here's a link to the phase two matrix for reference. OK. All right

@Trent [9:16]: All right. Phase one establishes the business case and operational foundation before building advanced systems. Which is to be expected

@Chris Andrade [9:23]: Can I ask a question real quick

@Matthew Kerns [9:25]: Yeah

@Trent [9:26]: Sure

@Chris Andrade [9:27]: What it is that diagram, like, what is that called? Is it just like an output of A certain that like the the impact and effort like just to Like how does that get

@Matthew Kerns [9:42]: I think this I think this is part of the sort of like from part of the training, but how it gets made is It's kind of like the bottom right one is the quick wins, and then the top right is, cause the bottom right is

@Matthew Kerns [10:03]: You know, it should be low effort on the bottom. And then Well, maybe it's organized properly, but Low effort, high impact is quick wins

@Matthew Kerns [10:20]: And then Medium effort, high impact. And the training, it's high impact, high effort, high impact. Would be the, yeah, a big swings. That's the better Diagram, that trying just pulled up.

@Chris Andrade [10:38]: So that

@Trent [10:38]: This is a temple

@Chris Andrade [10:39]: That output Provided the input to this.

@Trent [10:45]: Uh-huh. No Don't misunderstand. This is, I had nothing to do with what we're doing.

@Chris Andrade [10:51]: OK

@Trent [10:51]: I was just showing this a visual, a visual. Representation Of what this diagram is. See how that's a square with crosses.

@Chris Andrade [10:57]: OK Right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right.

@Trent [11:02]: It's It's a very rudimentary version of this.

@Chris Andrade [11:06]: Right OK

@Trent [11:07]: Right? Right? So

@Chris Andrade [11:08]: So it, it, OK, I get it. OK. So it

@Trent [11:12]: Yeah

@Chris Andrade [11:13]: The process that Converts that, what is that called?

@Trent [11:19]: They just It just, it's asking I think they call it an Aski diagram. But

@Chris Andrade [11:25]: OK.

@Trent [11:26]: I wouldn't spend too much effort trying to create this. This was

@Chris Andrade [11:29]: I, you know, it's just I'm trying to understand how everything works, like, how, how it all like kind of just plugs together, if that makes any sense.

@Matthew Kerns [11:40]: So there's like a

@Chris Andrade [11:41]: Or if I'm always

@Matthew Kerns [11:43]: There's an agent that we have that's a discovery process agent. It's just a, it's just a file that has instructions that takes That we can tell Cloud code to, hey, go through our discovery process and create an opportunity matrix.

@Matthew Kerns [12:01]: Like that's part of the process is there's business functions mapping then opportunity matrix creation. So when we tell it to create an opportunity matrix, it will, it will do something like this.

@Trent [12:01]: Mhm.

@Chris Andrade [12:13]: So it is, so this is like. Towards the end of the stack, if you will, of processing multiple Iterations of documents.

@Matthew Kerns [12:24]: Yeah Pretty much. Yup.

@Chris Andrade [12:27]: Now, is this, is this technically the last stack.

@Matthew Kerns [12:33]: So Yeah, so like now we've fed through all the meetings that we've had unless I skipped some, but I think I got most of the contexts wired up, and then we brought in Workbook One. We brought in

@Matthew Kerns [12:49]: Like a lot of stuff from Workbook One. And then We tried to put together an opportunity matrix, We did, we did like an overall opportunity matrix, and then we did, OK, let's create phase 1 through 4.

@Matthew Kerns [13:08]: And then let's really dial in on phase one, and we really worked on refining this phase one opportunities, So that's why I want you guys to review it cause we have, we, we think it looks good. and we just wanna make sure we didn't like miss anything. And we think that it can

@Matthew Kerns [13:29]: Lay the foundation, so that phase two, we can also Have some good deliverables.

@Chris Andrade [13:38]: Cool, I mean, I that that sounds, yeah, I, I, I would have loved to see like how you guys Were like Ironed all that out and getting in like you're just really cool to see your process down the road, but

@Matthew Kerns [13:54]: OK, you can. It's in a, a fathom link.

@Chris Andrade [13:55]: It Oh, OK, cool. Yeah, I, I would like, yeah, I, I would love to like just watch that on my own time.

@Matthew Kerns [14:05]: Cool.

@Chris Andrade [14:05]: So now when we're doing this assessment, is there anything in particular that we should look out for.

@Matthew Kerns [14:19]: Yeah, I think just any major gaps if there's anything that we haven't, that maybe we promised or that you've like talked with your mom about and told her like, this is gonna be part of the quick wins that we left out or

@Matthew Kerns [14:39]: If there's anything in the long term.

@Chris Andrade [14:41]: OK? So we'll just, we're just seeing more or less how align this document is with our current conversation.

@Matthew Kerns [14:51]: Right.

@Chris Andrade [14:52]: OK

@Matthew Kerns [14:53]: And And also this And also, we wanna look for Is this too much? Are we promising too much with this? And should we move some stuff to phase two, which we move to phase two, if that's the case. And thinking about also like proposal will come after this, so.

@Chris Andrade [15:07]: Yeah So phase one, this is our quick win plus what our deliverable is supposed to be.

@Matthew Kerns [15:12]: My Book. Yes

@Chris Andrade [15:28]: And so and this is a summary of of what is in in in in one. How, how did

@Matthew Kerns [15:36]: Yeah, like what we're gonna put up as our phase one Quick wins for

@Chris Andrade [15:42]: You

@Trent [15:44]: So it includes multiple things, right? So if you were to look at this chart briefly, You'll see in the top right-hand corner is P1 ROI, P1 web, P1 form. This also says P1DB, but let's leave that alone for right now because it's in the bottom right corner, OK? So just looking at these 3 ROI web and form. The ROI

@Trent [16:07]: P1ROI This is effectively Getting an ROI assessment plus stakeholder interviews. So effectively what they're getting, It's immediate value, we don't have any development really required for it.

@Trent [16:24]: Building trust, dual output, you get ROI plus SOPs. Build foundation So The success metrics looks like 7 data gaps in the ROI calculator filled CODB validated.

@Chris Andrade [16:41]: What's the CODB

@Matthew Kerns [16:43]: Cost of doing

@Chris Andrade [16:43]: OK

@Trent [16:46]: Costs of doing business.

@Matthew Kerns [16:49]: Yeah So I think inside of that is

@Chris Andrade [16:56]: You know, and that $400 per day, that was what they said estimated, right?

@Trent [17:01]: That's their estimate, yeah, probably came out of the conversation.

@Chris Andrade [17:03]: So you know it would be cool And I would be cool to do is if that there was a way that, OK, this is what you guys initially said your cost per day was, and then after running it through the process and like, this is actually your cost per day. Hopefully it's not

@Trent [17:19]: If you ask good questions

@Chris Andrade [17:21]: Say that again

@Trent [17:21]: If you ask the right question, if we ask the right questions in the follow-up interviews, right? And here,

@Chris Andrade [17:28]: Mhm.

@Trent [17:28]: Right? So then we should be able to get enough information to probably estimate that.

@Chris Andrade [17:29]: Mhm Yeah, I'm just using it as a point of reference to be like, hey

@Trent [17:37]: Yep.

@Chris Andrade [17:38]: This is where you, this is why we're doing this, cause you thought you were $400 per day, but in all reality, you're at 700 and $22.13 per day.

@Trent [17:50]: Yeah So, so basically what we're doing is that we're looking for all 7 gaps in the ROI calculator to be filled. We're looking at cost of doing business validation. So that's what you're just talking about right there is basically validating is it actually $400 a day, and then two initial SOPs created.

@Chris Andrade [18:06]: Mhm

@Trent [18:09]: There could be more that that comes out of this, but two promised

@Matthew Kerns [18:13]: Yeah.

@Trent [18:13]: We, we handling FOP and lot operations SOP.

@Chris Andrade [18:14]: He Bleed handling, hm. What is there a classification? What is entailed in lead handling?

@Trent [18:21]: And lot

@Matthew Kerns [18:27]: I'm not sure. It might be a little too arbitrary.

@Trent [18:27]: Hey

@Chris Andrade [18:32]: Other than that, I mean, I maybe I wouldn't, I probably would just leave the number of SOPs out and just say initial SOPs because we honestly don't know how many SOPs are gonna be, right?

@Matthew Kerns [18:42]: Yeah. Yup Exactly, I agree

@Chris Andrade [18:48]: Know, Polly just be a part of that assessment and like, hey, we, this is how much you're, you're gonna need, you're gonna need 18 SOPs. We don't really know until we start the assessment, which would be part of phase 2 implementation, right?

@Matthew Kerns [19:07]: Well, I think

@Chris Andrade [19:07]: Cause we're only will you be able to identify and give them, hey, like, like that lot that we can guarantee that lot operational SOP. But what if happens if there's a couple other ones, you know what I mean? Like a couple unidentified SOPs that are going to be needed, right?

@Matthew Kerns [19:24]: Yeah, I think the goal is with the stakeholder interviews, we want to get as much information about the operations as possible where ideally, we can generate all the SOPs that they need right now. To do their current operations.

@Matthew Kerns [19:43]: Which If you only have one interview per person, like, I mean, you're not gonna, you're probably still not gonna get all the SOPs. I think phase two is giving them their own SOP generator. So phase one will create the initial ones that are like the ones that they can think of their highest priority.

@Matthew Kerns [20:04]: In theory

@Chris Andrade [20:06]: So proposing that the company will have their own generator that can be generated in their own SOPs.

@Matthew Kerns [20:17]: Yeah

@Chris Andrade [20:18]: Huh.

@Trent [20:19]: Why not

@Chris Andrade [20:20]: That flipping the coin around. Hell yeah, dog, I mean. That's giving the tools right there.

@Matthew Kerns [20:27]: Mhm

@Chris Andrade [20:30]: Dude, that value alone, that's like Is that like Iterating their own piece of software. At that point, like Where does that come from?

@Trent [20:44]: No, it would be clearly defined input with a clearly defined output. It wouldn't be They're not gonna be iterating on their own software, they're gonna probably do something along the lines of what we talked about for

@Trent [21:01]: Kelsey Being able to record what they do throughout the day somehow, and use that to be able to process an input and then out comes an SOP.

@Chris Andrade [21:12]: So how do we, how do we market that? What's that, like, how do we present that to be like, Cha ching like pay now. Because in my eyes and what I'm hearing is like you're telling me that now I'm gonna be able to create my own SOPs and I'm gonna create my own build database, and now I got my own little systems that's gonna ultimately start telling me how to be better, and then ultimately be mine.

@Chris Andrade [21:40]: It's something to think about, like, I like that I feel like that we're creating something that that will be theirs.

@Matthew Kerns [21:42]: Oh So it'll, I think it'll be kind of, if you think about an AI agent It'll be kind of like a tool that an AI agent can use. So if they have like an operations helping

@Matthew Kerns [22:00]: Like a lot assistant AI agent. Then they could have SOP generator tool linked up to that.

@Chris Andrade [22:08]: I see what you're saying. So we'll be providing our own set of tools to delegate to each client, depending on the use case.

@Matthew Kerns [22:20]: Yeah, it's basically like a tool that they can use, and then There's different ways they could use it. Like it could be a plug-in for Cloud, I think, and then it could be The Claude skill, it could be An agent that we give them that we hook up for them.

@Matthew Kerns [22:42]: Like, I mean, they could also pull up chatGBT and do very much the same thing. But Like So But then it wouldn't have for each employee, it would have different company contexts, so it wouldn't give as good results.

@Matthew Kerns [23:02]: I think Yeah, I think how to market it would be like, OK, well, your business can't scale, it's because you're lacking SOPs

@Chris Andrade [23:10]: Yep

@Matthew Kerns [23:16]: Here's a solution to help make them. Using the app

@Chris Andrade [23:20]: Yeah What time you gotta be up tomorrow morning, man.

@Trent [23:26]: I'll be up at 6 a.m. So.

@Chris Andrade [23:33]: Yeah, you, you could

@Trent [23:33]: 7:30 here, not too bad.

@Chris Andrade [23:37]: Oh yeah, OK

@Trent [23:41]: But so There is the possibility that we can give our clients You know, Cloud Desktop, cloud, mobile It connects some things to it, right? So we could potentially do that, or we give them some tools with one of them, it can be like he like Matthew just mentioned. Here's some skills that you can just turn on and off inside cloud desktop.

@Trent [24:10]: So there's like Art creation, brand guidelines, you can just toggle it on, but we can add our own by clicking this button up here. We can create our own and add Skills to that. So, without us having to actually really truly build a piece of software, we could extend upon an AI agent.

@Trent [24:33]: To be able to give it the capabilities. Right? To more clearly defined, like, you can obviously go in here and you can, you can start a chat, and then you can start chatting with it. You can get an SOP out of it, but you'd have to know all the things that you need to say to get to that point. But what we can do is we can build an agent who can build a skill inside of Claude

@Trent [24:58]: And we can do this for ourselves. We don't have to do it, you know, it's not limited to a client.

@Chris Andrade [25:01]: Right

@Trent [25:02]: Right? So

@Chris Andrade [25:02]: This is where this is where my, my one of my guy said that this is a perfect opportunity that we work ourselves into a job. Versus just giving the tools or the client, the things they need, and then never see him again or work ourselves out of the job, right?

@Trent [25:24]: What Yeah, but at the end of the day, by giving them an SOP generator, it's giving them a tool, but they're not gonna know how to iterate upon it. Like when they need to add another feature or function. They're not gonna know how to do that

@Chris Andrade [25:39]: That's what I mean. That's when they call it.

@Trent [25:41]: Yeah.

@Chris Andrade [25:42]: I'm like, oh guys, hey, can we get another like level 4 supports like on our, on our bill this month cause we need to get this, this and this month, you know what I mean?

@Trent [25:53]: Yeah, yeah. So then there's also the

@Matthew Kerns [26:05]: And

@Trent [26:05]: There's also the possibility, go ahead, Matthew, go ahead.

@Matthew Kerns [26:09]: I was just thinking real quick that they, I think they might already have chatGPT so we might end up just doing a chat GPT version. If somebody doesn't have Claude, a subscription with Claude, then it would be an additional cost for them to sign up for a club.

@Chris Andrade [26:25]: Which one would be better though? I think Claude, I think they make making the client switch to Cloud would be better, you know, ultimately they just know chat JPT because it's the thing, right?

@Trent [26:40]: Let's talk about the most

@Chris Andrade [26:40]: I think If it's beneficial for us then to use JappetGBT, then cool, then let them use chat, but if it's more beneficial, if we get more usability out of their clouded environment, then I'd say let's say, OK, mister client, we recommend doing loud because XYZ. If you can

@Matthew Kerns [27:00]: Yeah And that's, that's where it kind of like the long-term roadmap planning comes into play, cause if we can see the whole picture, then we can make a better decision cause with just looking at the SOP gen generator by itself, like, It might be like a tossup between ChatGBT and Claude, for example, but if we have a long term picture, then we can be like, oh well.

@Chris Andrade [27:23]: You need both

@Matthew Kerns [27:24]: That this But.

@Chris Andrade [27:26]: I mean you're

@Matthew Kerns [27:26]: What

@Chris Andrade [27:27]: Gonna need, you're gonna need all of them, all of all of the genes, but I as long as it justified cost, then there's no argument, right? Oh

@Matthew Kerns [27:32]: Yeah Yeah Yeah. Hopefully they won't need to pay for too many, but yeah, I get like justified, it's gotta be justified by like

@Chris Andrade [27:41]: Right

@Matthew Kerns [27:45]: The business use case, yeah.

@Chris Andrade [27:46]: He turned on investment That's it, right

@Matthew Kerns [27:50]: Yeah.

@Chris Andrade [27:55]: What's this, Mr. Trent?

@Trent [27:56]: I mean Well, this is a demo on AI Studio, that you can upload a manual and have a chat with it.

@Chris Andrade [28:05]: What kind of, oh, so there's a Hyundai I10 manual.

@Trent [28:09]: In this case, yeah

@Chris Andrade [28:11]: Hm

@Trent [28:13]: So What I was bringing this up for was that yes, this might be You know, going to Claude Might be a good universal tool that we can extend upon to be able to give our clients

@Trent [28:31]: To start doing some things, it may be a little bit too much freedom and maybe just a little bit too much for some clients, it's going to depend probably on the client themselves. So what I was bringing this up for was to show that, oh, well, we also have the ability to create our own UI, but then we have to consider, do we want to create our own UI, which is our own app that we have to manage and maintain, right? So,

@Chris Andrade [28:58]: So, if they're requesting a checklist. Interface already, which me and Matt talked about Was, so we're talking about what you and I talked about Trent was about, and I know we probably to talked about Matt was getting, you know, getting paid or setting up, getting some sort of compensation for setting up people's environments. Ultimately to interact with all the things, right? One,

@Trent [29:25]: Yeah

@Chris Andrade [29:26]: And then The second one That we were On Too many thinking at one time, some bitch.

@Chris Andrade [29:46]: Keep going with, so so What were you doing? what what what was the idea behind the, the, the AI studios there.

@Trent [29:58]: I'm just showing that we have examples that we can copy and use. To create our own chat interface. So imagine this as an SOP generator and SOP

@Chris Andrade [30:11]: I see, I see I.

@Trent [30:12]: Chat, and that's what SOP Chat bought, right? You can talk to your own SOPs, plus you can ask it to create SOPs.

@Chris Andrade [30:21]: OK, then, so that's where I was going at. So If We already having to create this chatbot. And if we're already having to create these checklists, and if they are asking to they some of these checklists, they want to have pictures.

@Chris Andrade [30:42]: Right

@Trent [30:43]: Attached to the

@Chris Andrade [30:43]: If they're asking Say that again

@Trent [30:46]: You mean for like a visual representation of what they need to do for their checklist.

@Chris Andrade [30:51]: Or to verify that the door was locked.

@Trent [30:54]: Uploading Yeah, so take, take a picture of something. So for example, if you're doing an inspection on a shed, you may want to take a picture of a particular item on the shed, right?

@Chris Andrade [31:04]: Yeah, yeah, like cause normally they have to make take the keys out of the shed. They have to put a number on that key, and then they have to hang that number key into the key cabinet. Right? And so if they got all those steps done, they can take a picture of that number key inside the key cabinet and say, done, all the keys are there, you know what I mean?

@Chris Andrade [31:27]: Cause then you would see if there's not a key hung in slot 10, that means that there's not a building there. You know what I mean? So I think that's just one of the things that my mom came up with, and then Kelsey mentioned being able to have

@Trent [31:35]: Yeah.

@Chris Andrade [31:45]: Ability to take a picture for something, but then also he wants to start holding the employees accountable on a, the, the checklist being done, B the the time that they're arriving to the shop. Apparently there's no way that he's being able to reference that to hold them accountable, and so all these things, bless you. So they are, you know,

@Chris Andrade [32:15]: If they're asking for all these little things, these little widgets or these checklists, again, does it make sense to build something on our own. And then we can just make different iterations on the checklist needed for that client, cause he's a printer and these guys are sheds, or can it, can a checklist be generated from the SOP or originally, and then do it that way.

@Trent [32:41]: There's gonna be a checklist that'll probably be, you know, Maybe derived from the SOP, but the SOP may not actually have every single item in it. You may want to have an extra item here on the checklist. So there's probably going to be a checklist that's attached to the SOP that may be partially derived or it might be equivalent, or it might actually have some slight differences.

@Matthew Kerns [33:07]: And then tracking

@Chris Andrade [33:07]: And that's a

@Matthew Kerns [33:09]: Tracking if tracking is a big business use case, then We need to provide a solution for tracking it. I mean, The simplest, by the way, we should always consider the simplest approach, which would just be a Google Doc. So Google Doc with a checklist could have images in it.

@Matthew Kerns [33:31]: A Google Sheet could track.

@Chris Andrade [33:31]: Yeah

@Matthew Kerns [33:33]: That the checklist gets completed like week one has a sheet for week one.

@Chris Andrade [33:39]: Yep

@Matthew Kerns [33:39]: And that the checklist going down and then there's each day of the week, right? So I think I kind of think that during the quick wind sprint, Is a good time

@Trent [33:51]: Yeah, we

@Matthew Kerns [33:52]: To provide the simple solutions. And then And then if there's a reason to build something, like we don't, I think Trent was about to say this, we don't want to build for no reason, so.

@Trent [34:04]: Yeah, yeah, yeah, we don't, we in the quick wins, you know, we want to do the things that are going to get them high value without us having to have a high level of Complexity and maintenance behind it, because when we develop our own application, not only will it take the time and effort to do that. It's the time and maintenance that you have to put on the backside of it to support it as well. So

@Chris Andrade [34:26]: And I hope I can, yeah, and I guess I, I don't mean to allude to the fact that that's what we need to do right out of iterator one. No, I think Matthew's approach is makes perfect sense, and which they will do the MVP in order to get to step 2, right? And if you step one requires just simple basic spreadsheets, ultimately just to get the process going.

@Chris Andrade [34:53]: That's no problem

@Trent [34:55]: Yeah And what Matthew was saying, right, is that we should consider the options that are the simple solution with tools that we might already have available to us without building something, but we have something to think about is, would that be part of the final solution if we were to

@Trent [35:13]: Continue working towards the bigger picture. So, the things that we put in place should be either one, a stop gap that doesn't take too much effort to put in place. So that it gives us time, benefit now, time to build the final solution, or it's a piece of what the final solution is.

@Matthew Kerns [35:37]: Yeah And it can be It can be something that's like, OK, is this all Like it can give us quicker iterations on the data there. In the meantime. So

@Matthew Kerns [35:54]: Like if we had an app, it might take us longer to adjust the fields, But I mean, nowadays not that much longer, honestly. But like what's the, what's gonna be the reason for switching from Google Sheets and Google Docs.

@Matthew Kerns [36:13]: Well, there's maintenance required on their side to add another To add multiple Like to

@Chris Andrade [36:22]: Honestly, it's just an upel feature. I, I mean, at the it would be an upsell feature. I mean, for us, we're making our own proprietary shit. I would imagine that looks good as a company. Right It's just

@Chris Andrade [36:38]: If we wanted to go that route, if it makes sense, then we have, I'm just saying we have the use cases to go that route. Right? If we can get paid to build that out once we got to that point. Because eventually, the wolf shed, the the shed deal itself, it's going to be its own app eventually. I would imagine, right?

@Matthew Kerns [37:03]: Yeah, and once we have the idea down. Like generating the app.

@Chris Andrade [37:09]: Right.

@Matthew Kerns [37:10]: Nowadays is something we can, we can generate a prototype And then they can see it, but then, yeah, at the end of the day, it's like, why pay for this and how much extra is it gonna cost? That's something that we need to kinda figure out.

@Chris Andrade [37:27]: 100%

@Trent [37:34]: So, let's go through this real quick. I mean, we haven't really gotten very deep into it. So let's just go through it real quick. And so we have a, get a full picture of what is in this document, OK? So, the first is ROI assessment stakeholder interviews. So the idea is that we're collecting more information out of that information, we're gonna be getting to understand the business

@Trent [37:58]: And provide ROI calculations and provide some SOPs. That's, that's what this P1 ROI is

@Matthew Kerns [38:10]: Yeah, and the baseline, we're gonna get baseline metrics. For starting work with them.

@Trent [38:17]: Yeah. And then Moving to the next one is P1 web. Website quick fixes. Right? So this is, this is fixing the website so that it doesn't have broken blank images, broken embeds, mobile layout issues, slow load times, or poor local SEO.

@Trent [38:36]: So the idea here is to get their website back up to some reasonable standard. So that it You know, it, it At least doesn't look

@Chris Andrade [38:46]: That's amazing, dude. That, that would be, that would be freaking phenomenal. cause I just got an email from the host guy, saying that he's, what did it say? Said something to the effect that he's still getting notifications and wants to be taken off something. I gotta look at it.

@Trent [39:06]: Yeah, and then here's P1DB database foundation. So let's look at that real quick. So no centralized source of truth for inventory or overhead cost. Data is scattered across spreadsheets It mentions Fi store collections for products, financials, SOPs, and leads, but really, it really means actions, you know, someplace to store the products, the inputs, the SOPs, the leads. If we were to come back to the simplest

@Chris Andrade [39:24]: Oh shit. So, Yeah.

@Trent [39:36]: Thing again, using mat's example of we could do it in sheets in Google Dos if we need it.

@Chris Andrade [39:41]: Yeah. Yep.

@Matthew Kerns [39:44]: Yeah.

@Trent [39:44]: Good

@Chris Andrade [39:45]: I mean, isn't that the workbook one all built off of the sheets regardless, like there's like the seven sheets anyways that they're all lived on and used to pull and get information from.

@Trent [39:46]: Yeah Where's some of the sheets right here

@Matthew Kerns [39:58]: Right, so

@Chris Andrade [40:00]: Yeah

@Matthew Kerns [40:01]: Yeah

@Trent [40:05]: Right? So this sheet one is centralized inventory and model ID prices in spec. Sheet 7 Is fixed variable cost daily operating cost.

@Chris Andrade [40:19]: So it's funny, so my original plan was to set up this through Firebase. And then that changed it, but it's still pulling the fire-based reference so that Firestone is fire-based, and then it says fire base underneath.

@Trent [40:35]: Yeah Yep, yep So I think fire store is inside a firebase.

@Chris Andrade [40:42]: Yeah, oh God, it's so not stone.

@Trent [40:42]: Right? But we would evaluate that. We're not choosing that right now. That's just, it is mentioned in here, but it's not going to be chosen until we actually

@Chris Andrade [40:57]: Yeah, the only reason why I didn't wanna do firebase at all is because then they take all the IP.

@Trent [41:05]: What?

@Chris Andrade [41:06]: Like they, they like if it starts scaling, right? Then the From what I understood is that the intellectual property behind the the scalability is now

@Chris Andrade [41:23]: Owned by Firebase. If you built it on Firebase. The app or whatever you're creating.

@Trent [41:31]: I'm not sure I understand. You're saying the intellectual property itself of your intellectual property?

@Chris Andrade [41:39]: Whatever you click into Firebase to build the scalable solution.

@Trent [41:39]: Yes.

@Chris Andrade [41:46]: What I had thought was what it looked like to me was that it becomes firebases, Googles

@Trent [41:53]: Yeah. I don't know. I don't

@Chris Andrade [41:54]: Property

@Trent [41:55]: Yeah, maybe. I, I don't know. That sounds, that doesn't sound quite right to me, but

@Chris Andrade [41:57]: And OK, but yeah, other than that, that's the only reason why I stopped using Firebase, but it's still being referenced, and that's the only clarification that I'm trying to put in.

@Trent [42:08]: Yeah. Yeah, it's fine. It's fine. So we're, we're not choosing that right now anyway, so it's, it's not really here or there. So,

@Chris Andrade [42:10]: I

@Matthew Kerns [42:15]: Yeah, but the problem is an accurate problem, right, Chris, the data is scattered all over the place. Is that, is that true?

@Chris Andrade [42:24]: Yeah, so the overall problem exists. It's just the solution or the component being depicted as wrong. I don't know if there's a way to rerun it to eliminate that, but just a note for the note taker.

@Matthew Kerns [42:38]: Yep.

@Chris Andrade [42:42]: So what's snake case? Oh, I see. OK.

@Trent [42:47]: This is OK, right, lower case with an underscore.

@Chris Andrade [42:47]: Oh, giving the standard of the death. Mhm. Oh I see

@Trent [42:57]: It's better this way for like database. Handling and code This is better, but

@Chris Andrade [43:03]: Got it.

@Trent [43:05]: This is fine for human readability. But generally speaking, all of these special characters and whatnot, they get in the way and they cause problems. Whitespace

@Chris Andrade [43:08]: Right Got it

@Trent [43:15]: White space in between like these spaces causes problems in code.

@Chris Andrade [43:18]: OK. Yeah Got it

@Trent [43:23]: Yeah

@Chris Andrade [43:23]: So the success

@Trent [43:24]: You can't actually A lot of databases you can't even put whitespace in between words, so.

@Chris Andrade [43:31]: Hm Is that what that is called White Space between. I never heard that

@Trent [43:37]: Yeah, so white, white, white space is any character that you can type, like on a keyboard that doesn't show a character, so like a tab, a space, next line, new line, those are called white space characters, because they literally are just like a white space, like if you've got a white document, like a work document.

@Chris Andrade [43:43]: Hm Hm Right

@Trent [43:58]: You just press space, it makes white space. So

@Chris Andrade [44:01]: Got it.

@Trent [44:03]: Yeah. Yeah So success criteria. Is all products migrated, a calculator populated from the ROI assessment, snake case compliance verified. Developer access configured. So this one would be dependent on what we're doing.

@Trent [44:21]: Right? But I think the primary deliverable here would be this.

@Matthew Kerns [44:26]: Yeah, yeah.

@Chris Andrade [44:27]: Yeah. I have

@Matthew Kerns [44:31]: And also we should try and get Just in the stakeholder interviews, we should try and get as much information about what data they need to keep track of. I mean, We're just trying to build the foundation of the data with phase one, like over time we'll be adding to the database as we need it for other features, but as much as possible would be ideal.

@Matthew Kerns [44:55]: Phase one

@Trent [44:55]: Yeah Anything they're writing down, collecting, spreadsheets, documents, Anything that they're

@Chris Andrade [45:04]: That's a good question too that I would like to throw in that as like, do you write anything down? Oh, what do you write down?

@Trent [45:14]: Yeah, things that they type in somewhere, do they have a, do they have a system they need to put that into? Like, is there a web page they got to go to and put some stuff in or for me to type it in, or do they literally just have a paper note that they write it on, and then they just put it in a box and then eventually they come back and look at it, you know what I mean? Any of that stuff.

@Chris Andrade [45:23]: I gotta rewatch that, Really being a doctor.

@Trent [45:39]: Yeah, you're diagnosing what they're doing. You're really inspecting everything they're doing.

@Chris Andrade [45:43]: Mhm

@Trent [45:45]: Yeah. So, here's another one. So here's another deliverable P1 form. So this is the customer onboarding form. So this is basically the the web Form, right? The lead capture form on the website. Visitors leave without contact captured 0% capture rate. So if the user form is not very easy to get to, if it's doesn't actually collect any information for any reason, or if it just is, I mean, really, if there's any friction, not accessible, not exposed.

@Matthew Kerns [45:56]: Yep

@Trent [46:16]: Broken, any of those reasons. Right? So, and did we identify that there was an issue with the form?

@Matthew Kerns [46:24]: Let me check right now. I don't There is a form.

@Trent [46:30]: It says no feed capture on the on the. Website, but if I were to go back and look at it.

@Matthew Kerns [46:36]: Yeah, so that's not true cause there is a lead capture element there.

@Trent [46:41]: Right here, right

@Matthew Kerns [46:44]: Mhm

@Trent [46:44]: So is it, it, does it function would be another question. It looks like it's here

@Chris Andrade [46:47]: Yeah. Yeah, yeah, it functions

@Trent [46:51]: So I'm not sure where this one actually really arrived from, like, why it has.

@Chris Andrade [46:55]: So I just something note taker that P1 form the problem addressed is not correct.

@Trent [46:57]: I love

@Matthew Kerns [47:06]: Yeah, I think that was I think that was kind of like My idea or something that we had talked about, cause it was like, well, do we There's the QR code that has access to the the shed that they just scanned, but then the simplest version is just have a form.

@Trent [47:23]: Mhm

@Matthew Kerns [47:26]: Which I don't know why I thought that there wasn't, but there is, so.

@Chris Andrade [47:29]: You know, it'd be an important thing that we should start including in any prompt or anything that's analyzing transcripts is like at the end of the transcript, like, is there any areas of concern that you didn't know who was talking or maybe some things that were in question, but not really sure, you know, like pulling apart, separating those questions in the transcript for us to maybe ask further on, or maybe there

@Chris Andrade [47:59]: Was a, there was a little bit of confusion about who's like what the overall content was.

@Trent [48:03]: Uncertainty Yeah, because the agent always has certainty, right? Even if it's inaccurate.

@Matthew Kerns [48:06]: Yeah Yeah

@Chris Andrade [48:12]: And then we just discussed the separate that out for us to like actually physically go through to to allocate I think would be a helpful feature in all of our Transcribing methods.

@Trent [48:12]: Yeah

@Matthew Kerns [48:27]: Yeah

@Trent [48:27]: Yeah, either, either it's a an output that is appended or it's somewhere in the section of the document, or it's a separate piece that comes along with the document. Or you don't even have the output yet. It comes up and asks you the questions ahead of time, but it depends on how automated we intend on making it, right? So,

@Chris Andrade [48:47]: Yeah Even right now for reveal purposes would be cool.

@Trent [48:49]: I mean, Yeah

@Chris Andrade [48:56]: But yeah, 100% Placement.

@Trent [49:00]: So let's see

@Matthew Kerns [49:01]: So we could, instead of scrapping that completely, we could see if there's anything we could pull in. I don't know if there would be because if we don't have, I mean, we the QR code, pulling the QR code in.

@Chris Andrade [49:11]: There So what my thought, I want to enhance that intake form to have and then it's in the workbook, one, the ultimate idea behind the enhancement of, of it is incentivizing them to take a questionnaire

@Chris Andrade [49:35]: Right? Ultimately to understand what kind of client That you are

@Matthew Kerns [49:42]: Oh yeah, like a lead qualifier.

@Chris Andrade [49:45]: Yeah, and oh, are you, are you needing a shed or a garage, a shipping container? Are you, are you interested in maybe a greenhouse, right? Oh, it's like, oh, do you plan on a septic system, or do you need a road to be graded? Do you need a bunch of dirt to be hauled in, like, there's the, I have it that workbook one, there's a bunch of questions that I spent like trying to come up with use cases on questions to ask

@Chris Andrade [50:15]: Right, to separate what kind of clients, cause you can ultimately get You're gonna get so many types of, what if one client just wants greenhouses versus sheds or one client wants a metal building and needs a road, you know what I mean? So how do you get to that overall hone in like from here and then get him through the the funnel to get to there, you know, that's what my for that forum intake would be, but it's a process of like incentivizing

@Matthew Kerns [50:45]: Yeah

@Chris Andrade [50:52]: Programs like Cause you're gonna have to make people want to fill out that 7 question. I think they, the, the bot that I referred to it, you could reference it in there.

@Matthew Kerns [50:55]: Yeah

@Chris Andrade [51:05]: It's like 10 questions or I think like the the the good number for questions to be answered was like 4 you can, if you get lucky, if it's a good enough prize, you can get maybe 7, right? Those, they spend the time, you know.

@Matthew Kerns [51:22]: Yeah, so a couple things that come to mind when when you're talking there is There's Potentially That there's two things I'm thinking of, so I don't want to forget, but one is like, who's the ideal customer? Like who's someone who maybe buys multiple sheds like what does that person look like? So you can just create a

@Matthew Kerns [51:47]: Sort of like a description of them, and then you can Put together a list of like 4 questions that would determine, hey, is this person our ideal customer or how, what's their score? Are they close to the ideal customer, as like a

@Trent [52:03]: You should probably

@Matthew Kerns [52:04]: Qualifier

@Trent [52:05]: You should probably collect those questions from every single person that buys a shed, so that when you see these are how they answered it, and they bought this, right? They were our IG our ideal purchase, our ideal purchase

@Matthew Kerns [52:18]: Yeah

@Chris Andrade [52:20]: Oh

@Trent [52:23]: Matches these questions

@Chris Andrade [52:25]: Right

@Trent [52:25]: The answer questions. So, Yeah, you should probably ask a baseline set of questions to every single customer.

@Chris Andrade [52:34]: And then dude, we can like a like a give like a like a here's a fruit cause they have this thing up there in flag

@Matthew Kerns [52:35]: You know.

@Chris Andrade [52:42]: It's not Dutch bros, it's this the like a Dutch pros or flagstaff, and we know the owners, and we can give them free coffee, like get like we can buy cups of coffee at a reduced rate, right? And then say, hey, Mr. Kusner, thanks for this building that you just purchased. Hey, if you just take this moment to fill out this questionnaire, I'll give you a free cup of coffee to the Dutch bros. I forget what it's called, but they'll be like, oh shit, hell yeah, they would do it real quick.

@Trent [53:10]: Is there Yeah, that's fine. So that, that's giving incentive for someone to give you information is great. Is there a chance Is there any documentation step, where someone comes in and they have decided they're gonna buy

@Trent [53:31]: And then they have to come in and they have to sign a document. Is there anything like that

@Chris Andrade [53:40]: Say it one more time

@Trent [53:41]: As part of the process for purchasing a shed. When someone comes in, like, for example, a car, you go to a car lot, you say I want to buy a car. They say, OK, come over here to my desk. Let's fill out some paperwork. Is there anything like that at the shed?

@Trent [53:58]: Dealership

@Chris Andrade [53:58]: No No

@Trent [54:00]: Like, they say I wanna buy it and you say, give me your credit card, and then they walk out.

@Chris Andrade [54:06]: Well, more than 9 times out of 10, they walk in there, they know that they, they want to get the biggest building they can, and then we're we're are unfortunately we have to kind of set the expectations by asking them, actually, it's funny you say that, we have to ask them a series of questions, ultimately to understand potentially what size building they could even get

@Chris Andrade [54:36]: There are, they think they can get a 15 or a 14 wide, but then we look them up on the map and see we have to make that turn and there's just no way possible without tearing the wall out, you know, and they're like, oh, so you're saying I can only get an 8 ft wide, you know what I mean? But, but to answer your question, though, that would help out tremendously.

@Trent [54:47]: Yeah Yeah. You're, you're qualifying the purchase. Maybe not the prospect when you're qualifying the person. They, if they

@Chris Andrade [55:01]: Right Do you know how much time?

@Trent [55:05]: If they, if they

@Chris Andrade [55:06]: Spent on

@Trent [55:07]: They want to buy 100 inch TV And they can only fit a 70-inch TV on their wall. You don't want to sell them a 100 inch even though they want it, right? So, yeah, so.

@Chris Andrade [55:17]: Well, and this is where a lot of the customer pissed offness comes from, because then the customer says you told me I can get this building in here. You told me, so that's why luckily us our doship.

@Trent [55:31]: You sold it to me, right?

@Chris Andrade [55:33]: We're, we're our dealership shines because not only does my dad knows what the delivery capabilities are. I knew what the delivery capabilities are, but none of the other dealerships knew what the capabilities were, and you know why? It's because Graceland never gave the dealers

@Trent [55:45]: Yeah. So

@Chris Andrade [55:56]: The structure of how like, yes, they say you need this and this, but they don't know, they don't, the dealership doesn't know what's involved with the delivery, cause let's just say out of 10 dealerships, 7 of them never seen a delivery done before. So it's like, again, it's the questions.

@Trent [56:17]: So you do have opportunities to ask questions that right now the opportunity is, is being taken to qualify the purchase, but there is also an opportunity that you could maybe throw in some questions to just to measure the profile of the client.

@Chris Andrade [56:20]: Now And it's just still how the delivery though, and that's where I think the app or whatever comes into play cause then now they get just cause a lot of tensions now, they're already plugged into the lot attendant, and then they can there's a if there's a waiting like survey button at the below or something, but he clicked that and then then maybe it

@Trent [56:36]: Right

@Trent [56:52]: Yeah. Yeah Yeah To qualify like see what size of building you qualify for, right? But as part of that, you also ask a baseline set of questions for every client.

@Chris Andrade [57:00]: Yeah.

@Trent [57:05]: Every customer

@Chris Andrade [57:05]: Oh my gosh, dudes.

@Trent [57:08]: At the same time. Is, isn't that what like a doctor does? Like a doctor, you go into a doctor's office, like the eye doctor. They always want you to fill out paperwork all the time.

@Chris Andrade [57:09]: Just don't not. Bro

@Trent [57:18]: And it's always the same shit that they already have in their system.

@Chris Andrade [57:20]: Yeah.

@Trent [57:21]: So, so.

@Chris Andrade [57:21]: We do talk about the whole A whole other level to get the, because if we can direct people To our website to answer if they even can get a building.

@Chris Andrade [57:37]: No, not even Graceland has something like that. No other dealership has any type of knowledge base for our customer. Dude, no, that's why I created that YouTube video of how to anchor a building because nobody put one up.

@Trent [57:44]: That's That's I So that It's not even that complex of a problem. I'm just saying, that's low hanging fruit.

@Chris Andrade [57:56]: The anchor That Exactly. Now this is why I'm like damn it, if we're bringing people to the website to get those questions answered, right? We're kicking up now we're getting the the the the web traffic up.

@Trent [58:09]: Yes. Yeah. Yeah So, yeah, not only that, but you should actually utilize that form, not just for the web's website leads, but you should be using the form for every customer. Every customer that buys, every customer that has an inquiry, you should be asking them the same set of questions, because what it does and it helps qualify them for what they can buy, right? Whether it be a financial or a physical installation.

@Matthew Kerns [58:15]: Yeah.

@Chris Andrade [58:25]: Right Right. Every

@Trent [58:44]: It also lets you build a profile about your ideal customer. Like, who has actually been the best one to work with. Who is the one that bought the most sheds. Who is the one that bought the biggested, right?

@Chris Andrade [58:51]: But Yeah Oh Right, so I'm here, I'm here with Trent and Matthew, and we're going over some work stuff and we're under we're uncovering some opportunities here.

@Trent [58:59]: So.

@Chris Andrade [59:11]: You have that file that shows the illustration of how to bring the building in, that cartoon, that risen, that fucking joke. Yeah, send me, I need to wait till these guys see, OK, and then

@Chris Andrade [59:27]: Do we have any questionnaire That you can send us to ultimately gauge what kind of building the customer can have. No That the buildings can have. The customer, what kind so if like do you guys have any type of process to ultimately see what

@Chris Andrade [59:54]: Building the customer can get.

@Trent [59:56]: My size or type or what whatever.

@Chris Andrade [59:59]: It's OK, so it's pro it's a process called meet their needs. And There is a thing that we've been training on called the Road to the sale. I can send you. What is that? Is it a PDF or what?

@Chris Andrade [1:00:19]: It's basically of like what the Chris It's hard to Basically it's just like gauging Or like the best way to like talk to people and close the sale, turn the cell into a close. OK. And is it a PDF or is it like a training tutor like a web in web blogging.

@Chris Andrade [1:00:49]: No, it's a PDF. Beautiful. Thank you. Check that one. Now send me that that cartoon to use, OK, I did When you are in the, like if there was a way to ask a set of questions to somebody who just bought a building.

@Chris Andrade [1:01:09]: How do you word that, Matthew? Like, what's it like, do you think it would be hard to get somebody to answer A set of questions after you made a sale on a building. It's just like

@Trent [1:01:24]: Like 3 to 5, like 3 to 0.

@Chris Andrade [1:01:24]: Selling out, like, like, like, hey, thanks for your purchase on this building. I know you're excited. Can, can I just ask these 3 to 5 questions. Yeah OK. We'll try it out. I mean, it's worst case scenario, you know what I mean? I'm what.

@Chris Andrade [1:01:43]: No, I was asking May. This is your cool, man. This is my brother, so we don't have to be so professional. We could be, we could be guys, we're good. But all right, all right, that's that's all I needed, but yes, send me that information, please.

@Trent [1:01:51]: Yeah, yeah.

@Chris Andrade [1:01:59]: Thanks. Thank you bye That's interesting. That's new

@Trent [1:02:06]: Yeah, so, I mean, I didn't think about it until we were just talking about it, right? But it makes sense. It makes sense what Matthew was saying was that if you could

@Chris Andrade [1:02:11]: Right

@Trent [1:02:17]: Qualify people in a way. As they come into the intake, Right, on whether or not they are one of your high profile clients. High profileier, right? But you don't have a baseline. You don't know what it matches. You can guess, but if you don't have any metrics or measurement of any sort. You, you, you're just shooting in the dark. So that's why I was suggesting what you really need to do is have a standard set of questions. You can change it at some point, but the standard set of questions that you ask everybody.

@Chris Andrade [1:02:26]: Yep Yep

@Chris Andrade [1:02:50]: So this is the most beautiful fucking thing. This is why we're doing this, guys, cause now we're creating the opportunity because we're creating the SOPs where unexposing the opportunities that can happen because of it. For instance,

@Matthew Kerns [1:02:51]: Yes.

@Chris Andrade [1:03:07]: We now have to charge somebody $150 just for us to come to somebody's house to do an assessment if they can get the building in through their property or not. And it has been very successful.

@Chris Andrade [1:03:24]: But the problem is, it's the scheduling. The the the customer even knowing that's an option. Right And honestly, the time, we're losing money because if they live 150 miles away.

@Matthew Kerns [1:03:40]: Yeah

@Chris Andrade [1:03:40]: That's 100 miles, as you know what I mean, we're making less than like $30 an hour. But we're doing it because

@Matthew Kerns [1:03:47]: So something Something I was thinking is like, you know how it says right here, Arizona's best metal building and shed manufacturer. What if right here it just says, find out if If find out, find out which shed is best for you.

@Matthew Kerns [1:04:03]: And then there's a questionnaire, there can be

@Chris Andrade [1:04:07]: Find out which product is best for you, right?

@Matthew Kerns [1:04:10]: Sure, yeah, and then there can be a questionnaire and then it's like, and then even as part of that questionnaire, they could say, you know, not sure about some of these answers. Book a call with one of our specialists, and we'll, we'll talk through it on video, and you can show us around like just with their their phone. They can just walk around with their phone.

@Chris Andrade [1:04:30]: So that's why I was literally going with that Matt. So what we were saying is we'll give them a consultation. If we had a platform, we say we need, we give them a guide of what pictures we need, and this is what I would do for my deliveries, right? Because I would, in ultimately for cause I was doing 7 deliveries a day. Still, no one to this day was able to do 7 sheds in one day, and it was because I prequalified my deliveries to see how

@Trent [1:04:33]: Yeah.

@Chris Andrade [1:05:00]: Hard they would be, and I would do my easy ones first And then save the hard ones for last. And then so, anyways, I would ask for a set of pictures. Take a picture from the road. Where's the building going? Anyways, I have that and then send that same picture and then follow, make a little video from the road to how you think the shed would go to towards the resting location. Upload.

@Trent [1:05:27]: There's lots to do that, right, to help, to help evaluate the situation. Sure, sure.

@Chris Andrade [1:05:30]: Right But again, they we when we try to like text message, they would get lost, send an email. There was always in problem setting it, and I was like, damn, this is where I want to look.

@Trent [1:05:40]: Yeah So before we I mean, those are good to have in the longer, more medium term, but like in the short term, what Matthew was just suggesting was that instead of just having a very simple, put your name in your email and a message in here. If you go to some other websites, you go to some other websites, they don't have a user form that says like just give me this and ask me a question. It says, find the shed that that fits you best, right? And then it steps you through all the questions, and at the end

@Chris Andrade [1:05:58]: Yeah, right, right. Then.

@Trent [1:06:15]: It says, oh, give me your username and or give me your name and your phone number and we'll contact you so that we can give you a personal, you know, a personal,

@Matthew Kerns [1:06:26]: But

@Trent [1:06:26]: I said.

@Chris Andrade [1:06:27]: Just so you know, it is something that will just because this is our client, but this is my mom.

@Trent [1:06:27]: But I Oh

@Chris Andrade [1:06:32]: When I told her about that, she wanted, made it very clear that she does not want it to seem like we are trying to sell her, she's like, I want a message to say, you know, hey, the reason why we're asking for your phone number and email is we're a family owned business, we may book like

@Chris Andrade [1:06:54]: Fuck, can we make personal connections like we're not gonna like your number, we take that very seriously, like she wanted to have that personal iteration to like, before you give me your number, this is why.

@Trent [1:07:07]: Yeah, so, but, so that, that is important. I agree with that. It helps build trust, right, and credibility. but Quite literally just saying, you know, Here's a, like the, the way the form is right now.

@Trent [1:07:24]: OK, it's quite literally name, email, message. Doesn't even really, I mean,

@Chris Andrade [1:07:32]: Yeah, so you're saying this.

@Trent [1:07:33]: Doesn't really build that credibility. Of like, well, why am I putting my stuff in your, in your user form. It's because I have a question, right? But if you build the story of, oh, you've just identified your most ideal shed. Now you want to reach out to them. You want them to say, hey, come talk to me so that I can, so that I can, you know, understand.

@Chris Andrade [1:07:51]: Yeah I guarantee you we told that to my mom, she's gonna be like, check please cause I think dude, that is, that would definitely bring a whole lot of value, right away, and then it would definitely initiate a really good presence to that lead funnel for

@Chris Andrade [1:08:15]: Sherk

@Matthew Kerns [1:08:16]: Yeah, and then

@Trent [1:08:16]: Yeah, I think that it's just, it's more engaging.

@Matthew Kerns [1:08:20]: And then once we have that, OK, they've they've decide they've understood kind of which shed that's on the lot right now that's best for them. I don't know if We, we can wire up the exact shed just yet. I don't think we can until we have that inventory data, but like what I'm thinking just long term vision is kind of like, OK, well

@Matthew Kerns [1:08:41]: Something we already talked about, but once we, once we have that, then it's like, OK, do you love this shed? Do you want to see if this will actually work. This will actually fit where you want it to go. Do you want to take our process? Here's the pictures you need to take and the video, and then that leads into the next one, but it's optional. It's like they can

@Trent [1:08:59]: Like you get a pre-qualification, right? Or you get like the, the conversation starter Right? And then if they want to go to the next step, now they can take pictures and they can drop them into the thing, and then that all gets submitted

@Matthew Kerns [1:09:05]: Yeah.

@Trent [1:09:13]: Like we we would We probably at this point in time, cannot confidently use a picture and automatically tell them

@Matthew Kerns [1:09:15]: Exactly.

@Trent [1:09:23]: Any useful information or for qualification, but what we can do is collect it and send it to somebody that can use it to evaluate it and then get back to them, right?

@Matthew Kerns [1:09:29]: Mhm. Yep. Put together a report of your employees go and just look at that report and be like, OK, well I can't tell if this will work or any more.

@Chris Andrade [1:09:42]: Bro, do you know what that would do just to the whole shed industry alone, just standardizing that simple process

@Matthew Kerns [1:09:53]: No idea

@Trent [1:09:54]: So where does that sit? So, if, if, let's say that we have the user form, we were talking about taking the user form out of the the P1 deliverables or whatever, but

@Chris Andrade [1:10:06]: I mean yeah the the more we're talking about it, it's like, goddamn, that thing alone, just being able to, that's client engagement there at its finest. Like we're getting real live information right away, like, like that shit is gold.

@Chris Andrade [1:10:24]: That shit is gold, and then it opens up the opportunity for more iterations than we like men, men, if we spent another $1000 this month on just add like just for incentivizations for more data, like look at what we get.

@Matthew Kerns [1:10:25]: Yeah

@Chris Andrade [1:10:41]: Especially gearing up for the march ad campaign.

@Matthew Kerns [1:10:41]: Yeah.

@Chris Andrade [1:10:45]: March and April ad campaign.

@Matthew Kerns [1:10:47]: See, OK, so there's March and April ad campaigns. So if we started that today where we start collecting client data today, we'll have 2 months, maybe 1.5 months of data before the ad campaign, and that's not that much data because we're not going to have too many, there's going to be a certain amount of sales that's like 10 sales or whatever that validate, OK, this is the client profile, but there's only cert like statistically, there's only

@Chris Andrade [1:11:06]: I teach. Hm

@Matthew Kerns [1:11:17]: A certain number, if we have 10 purchases out of 200 people, that's not necessarily statistically significant, so basically like the more data that you have, the more accurate it is. So I'm all I'm trying to say is, the sooner we start, the better, the more data you get.

@Chris Andrade [1:11:34]: And and and the the coolest part is then then if it's implemented, tested, ready to go by April. Dude Like, 4th of July sale is when they go all out. I mean

@Chris Andrade [1:11:51]: We'll be, we'll have a good data set by then. You know, so I guess, you know, we'll do what we're gonna deliver it how we're delivering it, and then ultimately we'll let her decide. I just have a feeling that that form generator is gonna kind of

@Chris Andrade [1:12:09]: Take all presence, in my opinion. But we could still do the inboarding and the interviewing and the SOP documentation just might slow it down a little bit if that's what she wants to do.

@Matthew Kerns [1:12:13]: OK.

@Chris Andrade [1:12:23]: But I have a feeling that she's gonna want to do.

@Matthew Kerns [1:12:23]: Well OK, yeah, I mean, we definitely need the baseline data, so I think we should go through the the ROI stakeholder questions,

@Chris Andrade [1:12:34]: Oh no, that's gonna happen regardless, right? It's just how fast does that turnaround versus that lead qualifier. I honestly think more I'm thinking about it like, I feel like that quick win is kind of taking precedence

@Matthew Kerns [1:12:35]: Stuff. Yeah.

@Chris Andrade [1:12:51]: But at the end of the, I want her to say that, not me.

@Matthew Kerns [1:12:51]: Yeah And, OK, and it'll take us some time to put it together. It's not like we could launch it today, right?

@Chris Andrade [1:13:00]: Oh, no, right, I wouldn't expect it. I wouldn't, I mean, you know, I wouldn't even set that anticipation for at least 30 days till whenever we agree.

@Matthew Kerns [1:13:04]: So OK, so then we're gonna need the stakeholder interview questions. So I, I do want to go through those or I want you guys to go through those at some point, cause me and Mika were thinking, we wanna do this for plotter mechanics before Monday, cause you're gonna have question, you're gonna have

@Matthew Kerns [1:13:31]: Stakeholder meetings with plotter mechanics next week, and

@Chris Andrade [1:13:34]: On Tuesday, yeah.

@Matthew Kerns [1:13:36]: OK, Tuesday. So we have some questions created, but today we went through these questions for SNS wolfsheds, and we thought they looked pretty good. So what I'm going to do is take the process we did for SNS and try and apply that to plotter mechanics, make sure, so if we can make sure that these questions are good, if they're not good, we can adjust the process for plotter.

@Trent [1:13:37]: So

@Chris Andrade [1:14:01]: OK I, and are we looking at him right now? Sorry.

@Matthew Kerns [1:14:07]: Yeah, trying to put

@Chris Andrade [1:14:07]: I'm trying to

@Matthew Kerns [1:14:08]: One.

@Trent [1:14:09]: Yeah, this is the stakeholder questions for ROI.

@Chris Andrade [1:14:09]: Once

@Matthew Kerns [1:14:13]: Yeah. So we put together a bunch of questions and then we asked Claude to pull To fill in information from the transcripts where it found it to not make anything up, and

@Matthew Kerns [1:14:32]: Kind of like help us fill in the questions with stuff that we've already heard about. So we do

@Chris Andrade [1:14:35]: Oh, so this questions that they've already answered.

@Matthew Kerns [1:14:40]: Yeah, in theory, we, we have, we got to validate this stuff cause, you know, it's still that chance it cannot be.

@Chris Andrade [1:14:45]: And so we did take so it would be like the process to validate as well, right?

@Matthew Kerns [1:14:54]: What do you mean by that?

@Chris Andrade [1:14:57]: Well, hey, so, I'm sorry, let me, I'll, I'll keep my questions to the end.

@Matthew Kerns [1:15:02]: OK. But yeah, part of what we have to do is validate

@Chris Andrade [1:15:10]: Hm. Interesting Hm.

@Trent [1:15:17]: So did you, this is something to consider, OK?

@Matthew Kerns [1:15:23]: Mhm.

@Trent [1:15:23]: There are Stakeholder questions in this framework.

@Matthew Kerns [1:15:29]: Yeah, I think we pulled it from here.

@Trent [1:15:33]: OK, so yeah, I was just trying to see If you took that into consideration, right? So this right here is template one stakeholder interview of the 30,000 ft view.

@Matthew Kerns [1:15:39]: Just Mhm

@Trent [1:15:44]: Right. So role and team, core processes, tools and technology, pain points and future vision.

@Matthew Kerns [1:15:52]: So

@Trent [1:15:52]: Pamphlet 2 End user interview. So the end user would be like the People on the ground, right That do the daily tasks

@Trent [1:16:09]: In a small business, that's in some ways that's everyone. But in, but there are Gonna be stakeholders. For both instances.

@Matthew Kerns [1:16:22]: Yeah, these are, I mean, might just end up scrapping what we have and and using these, I mean, I think we have

@Trent [1:16:31]: I didn't, I didn't mean that but basically what you guys, the effort that you guys put in.

@Matthew Kerns [1:16:32]: To refinement No, yeah, I mean, well, it was a few problems with Claude with the questions, and then we just asked it to tie in the context. The more effort was put into the phase mapping, I think, but, but I mean, these are like, these are some pretty good questions, and they're general enough where you can ask multiple people and get the answers, but

@Matthew Kerns [1:16:59]: I think let's look at both of them. And just We should decide on a final list, probably for targeted for each person at the end of the day.

@Chris Andrade [1:17:09]: Yeah, I think we can Cause I'm reviewing this right now. And I'll be able to What I'll do is, on my own time, let me look what we're doing right now and then I will create a fireflies.

@Chris Andrade [1:17:35]: Going through it after I've downloaded it and kind of just, yeah.

@Matthew Kerns [1:17:35]: Yeah.

@Chris Andrade [1:17:39]: And then use this transcript and then just continue the I dude, what we got in this transcript alone is kind of gold. Right now, because we hit some topics that really are going to set us up for a whole other gameplay that

@Chris Andrade [1:17:57]: Is, I think, will be more of a ROI than SOPs, but I think the SOPs can be done simultaneously, you know what I mean?

@Matthew Kerns [1:18:08]: Yeah, I think they should be. Yeah, cause if you start generating more sales, but there's problems with the operations. You're just going to cause more problems.

@Trent [1:18:09]: Definitely

@Chris Andrade [1:18:20]: Right, no, and, and, and I think this is the, the best way to kind of come at this approach, for sure. I think it's gonna be the one that's gonna, honestly, like, once she sees, like, dude, that we informed deal like that got me excited cause that's like, that's like the beginning to the lead funnel generating system by Avision that could ultimately get remiss work.

@Chris Andrade [1:18:47]: I mean, dude, the green hawk is start selling more greenhouses, more metal buildings, all that shit. And like, you know, it's gonna open up the doors to so many other more sales opportunities. Now that I'm thinking about it.

@Matthew Kerns [1:19:00]: Yeah. Have you have you came across Russell Brunson before?

@Chris Andrade [1:19:06]: Russell

@Matthew Kerns [1:19:06]: Oh With click funnels

@Chris Andrade [1:19:11]: Russell Brenson

@Matthew Kerns [1:19:14]: Russell Brunson. Yeah, I mean, he's gonna sell you stuff, so just, but his, his stuff is, I think, pretty good.

@Chris Andrade [1:19:25]: Interesting, I got his website pulled up.

@Matthew Kerns [1:19:28]: Yeah, clickFunnels.com.

@Chris Andrade [1:19:32]: Hmm. And what, and so I'll have to Oh shit

@Matthew Kerns [1:19:48]: It's all this, it's all this online stuff like landing pages, lead magnets, opt-in forms, surveys.

@Chris Andrade [1:19:55]: Oh dude, don't, you're gonna get me all fucking you like rabbit hole on rabbit, oh dude, hold on, I got this, I don't even, I, I'm gonna have to book with this. Nope, not right now. No. I got a lot of shit to do.

@Trent [1:20:13]: Well, I, I, real quick, real quick, since we're all here, do you guys have a like, I think we are reported much an assessment that we're gonna, they go, did you wanna keep continue doing this or?

@Matthew Kerns [1:20:27]: So I think

@Chris Andrade [1:20:27]: Review it still or is there anything else you wanted to add to it before we switch gears?

@Trent [1:20:32]: Matthew, yeah

@Matthew Kerns [1:20:32]: I priority, yeah, my priority is, making sure we have enough information to generate the proposal. So like, if we can generate the proposal, by Monday, that would be cool. so I think what I wanna do is take the transcript from this and apply it to the phase one document.

@Matthew Kerns [1:20:55]: And then, yeah, and then.

@Chris Andrade [1:20:55]: OK That's a good idea. You take the transcript, but we have already.

@Matthew Kerns [1:20:58]: OK

@Chris Andrade [1:21:02]: Reiterate with the V2.

@Matthew Kerns [1:21:02]: Yeah

@Chris Andrade [1:21:05]: And then

@Matthew Kerns [1:21:05]: Yeah

@Chris Andrade [1:21:07]: Can we keep the versions to reference old versions from new versions? Is that, is that doable or is that redundantly a pain in the ass.

@Matthew Kerns [1:21:17]: So the version that we have is always going to be there at the It's in GitHub. It's already available if you look back in time on past versions, but we can also do something where we just Keep like a version history.

@Matthew Kerns [1:21:34]: With edits, just in the document, like we can ask Claude, like, hey, what happened in the change or like we're gonna ask it to keep a revision history.

@Chris Andrade [1:21:35]: Yeah

@Trent [1:21:42]: Painful Yeah, I check walk, right.

@Matthew Kerns [1:21:44]: Yeah. Yeah, exactly. Like high-level, just

@Chris Andrade [1:21:48]: OK.

@Matthew Kerns [1:21:50]: What changed from version to version. 11 workflow we can also consider when we're iterating on documents like this is like We can go through the document once and I'll talk about it. And then we can end the huddle, and then we can

@Matthew Kerns [1:22:09]: Pull the transcript, get on a new huddle and apply it On the new huddle and then go through the updated version.

@Chris Andrade [1:22:15]: Oh Yeah, yeah.

@Matthew Kerns [1:22:18]: You know what I mean

@Chris Andrade [1:22:20]: I mean, do you wanna do that right now?

@Matthew Kerns [1:22:24]: We could. How long have we been on this though? Cause we've been on here for like an hour and a half maybe.

@Chris Andrade [1:22:29]: I don't know, only in.

@Trent [1:22:31]: Oh, about 1 hour and 15.

@Chris Andrade [1:22:32]: Yeah.

@Matthew Kerns [1:22:33]: RM 15, OK, yeah, we could, we could, I might be down and then Yeah, that way we can just iterate on it again just because we are already, our context window is already full of all this stuff, so we could iterate on it like.

@Chris Andrade [1:22:49]: Yeah, this, this, let's run through that real quick, Matt. I'm gonna take a little break quick. I'm gonna grab some, I'm gonna make some tea real quick, and then let's run through that.

@Trent [1:22:58]: OK, so let's, everybody has to leave the huddle, so it'll close out.

@Matthew Kerns [1:22:58]: OK

@Chris Andrade [1:23:02]: By

@Matthew Kerns [1:23:03]: Right.

@Chris Andrade [1:23:03]: Are we, what other, well, how are you gonna open it back up in wool sheds?

@Matthew Kerns [1:23:07]: Yeah, like 5, 10 minutes, probably 5 minutes.

@Chris Andrade [1:23:08]: OK Sounds good, but

@Matthew Kerns [1:23:11]: We could even do it right away, but yeah.

@Chris Andrade [1:23:14]: OK, I'll, I'll come back on 10.

@Matthew Kerns [1:23:16]: OK. All right. Let's see you guys.

@Trent [1:23:18]: Yeah Too.
