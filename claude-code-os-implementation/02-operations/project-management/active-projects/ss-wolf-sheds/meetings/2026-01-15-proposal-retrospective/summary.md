## Meeting Purpose

Post-mortem on the S&S proposal presentation - identifying what missed, what worked, and establishing action items for follow-up and process improvements.

---

## What We Did Well

### Clear Post-Mortem on Missed Objective
- Identified core miss: didn't connect plan to sales outcomes; emphasis on foundation overshadowed "how $10k drives sales"
- Agreed to reframe with a visual, result-oriented path and plain-language targets

### Data-Driven Approach Alignment
- Converged on leveraging 3 years of sales data to build inventory/sales analytics
- Recognized ad testing rigor: hypotheses → split tests → baseline → iterate

### Rapid Follow-Up Planning (Exigent/Tim)
- Decided to add process diagram + ROI calc addendum and schedule follow-up
- Time-bounded action: land in inbox early AM

### Operational Candor and Coordination
- Openly surfaced SOP gaps (Jobber request deletion risk)
- Agreed on faster internal comms for client-facing changes (real-time pings)

---

## What We Can Do Better

### Tie Strategy to Outcomes
- Translate technical plan into a crystal-clear "path to sales" with milestones and KPIs per dollar spent

### Audience Targeting and Clarity
- Calibrate language/visuals to stakeholder (e.g., Sandra) to avoid overwhelm; lead with outcomes, then mechanics

### Proposal Process Discipline
- Document and enforce a proposal checklist (target avatar, outcomes-first narrative, visuals/examples, metrics, payment details)

### Centralize and Retrieve Ad Data
- Access and audit existing Meta assets; ensure tracking, attribution, and data capture are reliable and findable

---

## What We Will Stop

### Tech-First, Outcome-Second Pitches
- No more leading with implementation details without mapping to revenue impact

### Deleting Jobber Requests
- Stop deleting source requests; preserve call notes/transcripts linkage

---

## What We Will Start

### Build S&S Inventory/Sales Intelligence
- Aggregate 3 years of spreadsheets into a usable database (by location, product type, time)
- Create geo-visuals (map pins, filters by model/size) and seasonal trend views
- Define bonus-timeline insights to counter inventory "lag" and guide transfers

### Hypothesis-Led Ad Testing
- Write explicit hypotheses (who/where/why), set small daily budgets, split test creatives/audiences, and measure CAC/ROAS
- Establish baseline from historical spend; document test plans and results

### Lightweight Explainer Videos
- Record quick Loom/Bubbles for SOPs, discoveries, and client enablement; attach to Notion tasks

### Proposal OS Upgrades
- Update Sales OS with addendum examples, outcome framing, and wire/check instructions
- Maintain an example gallery for future prospects

---

## Other Discussion Topics

### Inventory Lag Theory and Bonus Mechanics
- Corporate system delays may show units on-hand but unsellable for ~1 week; impacts bonus qualification timing
- Real-time inventory pulse across locations could enable strategic transfers to hit thresholds

### Geo Challenges and RTO Tracking
- Tuba City lacks addresses; deliveries rely on coordinates; current RTO repos tracked via paper/screenshots
- Opportunity: customer-provided precise map pins at order; potential low-cost trackers discussed for loss mitigation

### Plotter Mechanics Scope and Payments
- Expect potential additional $5k by Feb 7; maintain delight via SOPs and proactive guidance to prevent misuse

### Community Engagement for Exigent
- Share examples in AuditFlow beta and DIY pod to accelerate feedback and visibility (Nick active there)

## Key Learnings

### Core Miss Identified
The proposal led with technical foundation work rather than connecting every dollar to sales outcomes. Sandra and stakeholders need to see the "path to sales" visually, not implementation details.

### Proposal Improvement Formula
1. Lead with outcomes (revenue impact, KPIs)
2. Then show the path (milestones, timeline)
3. Finally, explain mechanics (only if asked)
