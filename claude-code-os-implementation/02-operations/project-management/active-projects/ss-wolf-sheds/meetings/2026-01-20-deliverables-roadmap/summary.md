## Meeting Purpose

Define technical requirements for S&S Wolf Sheds' digital transformation.

---

## Key Takeaways

1. **Phase 1 MVP: Lot Assistant** - QR-code-based on-site lead capture (Name/Phone) via low-friction giveaway (e.g., free delivery), designed to engage visitors and reduce bounce rate

2. **New Sales Strategy** - Shift from untargeted "shotgun" ads to data-driven campaigns by cross-referencing historical sales data with Meta ad performance

3. **Internal Efficiency** - Implement "Man-Hour Factor" to quantify ROI by showing how new systems generate revenue more efficiently than current manual tasks

4. **Long-Term Vision** - Transform dealerships into self-sufficient "hubs" with dedicated power (generator) and internet (Starlink) to enable 24/7 operations

---

## Problems Identified

### On-Site Experience
- Visitors on acre-plus lots often leave without engaging staff
- Results in lost leads with no capture mechanism

### Ad Spend Inefficiency
- Current Meta ad spend ($400/mo) is untargeted ("shotgunning")
- Lacks clear ROI tracking

### Fulfillment Gaps
- Graceland frequently drops the ball on customer communication
- Leads to negative experiences
- Requires manual intervention from SNS staff

### Dealership Infrastructure
- Remote lots lack reliable power and internet
- Limits digital tools and increases security risks
- Break-ins at Tuba City lot noted

---

## Solutions Defined

### Phase 1 MVP: Lot Assistant

**Concept:** QR code on each shed links to Client Profile/Lead Qualification form

**Goal:** Capture on-site visitors who might otherwise leave

**Incentive Structure:**
- Low-friction giveaway (Name/Phone only) to maximize sign-ups
- Potential Offer: Free mini-shed delivery - high-value ($2.5k+) service SNS can uniquely offer
- Risk Mitigation: First campaign could offer discount instead of free delivery to ensure sufficient lead volume covers costs

**Future Enhancement:** Simple chatbot (fed the sales SOP PDF) to answer questions while visitors wait, further reducing bounce rate

---

### Data-Driven Sales & Marketing

| Component | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Data Integration** | Cross-reference historical sales data (3 years) with Meta ad performance |
| **Ad Optimization** | Create targeted campaigns that scale sales revenue |
| **Pixel Tracking** | Install Meta Pixel on QR landing page to link on-site visits to digital touchpoints |
| **AI-Powered Strategy** | Leverage AI (Claude) to analyze data and generate proactive marketing campaigns for slow seasons |

---

### Internal Efficiency Systems

#### Customer Follow-Up System
- Automate post-sale check-ins to ensure Graceland meets communication standards
- Proactively manage customer experience, prevent issues, build trust
- Creates productive work for staff during slow periods
- Generates potential upsell revenue

#### "Man-Hour Factor" ROI Model
A system to quantify value of new processes by comparing efficiency to current methods.

**Example:** If a task currently takes 1 man-hour, a new system completing it in 0.25 hours yields a 0.75-hour gain = clear ROI demonstration

---

### Long-Term Vision: Dealership "Hubs"

**Goal:** Transform each dealership into a self-sufficient hub with:
- Dedicated power (generator)
- Reliable internet (Starlink)
- 24/7 operation and connectivity

**Benefits:**
- Eliminates reliance on unreliable local infrastructure
- Creates new revenue stream by offering hardware/service packages to other dealers
