0:01 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
So maybe like should I kind of I don't know I guess we'll talk it out and then like I think we already got the idea of what we're talking about.

0:15 - Chris Andrade
So go ahead and talk through the technical requirements, and then we'll go from that. Okay.

0:23 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
So like, okay, I guess from the technical side, we need to know what to build phase one. And in order to know what to build phase one, we need to map out everything that SNS is going to want that's going to be valuable for SNS long term. So it's the lot assistant and QR code links on each shed that when the customer scans it, then they they get taken to a page that It's like Client Profile Lead Qualification Form, so... Oh, okay. And then... I'm gonna go...

1:13 - Chris Andrade
Can I hone you in? Yeah, can I hone you in just a little bit?

1:18 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Well, I was thinking I go for all four features, or all four things, and then we can dive in detail on each one.

1:27 - Chris Andrade
Perfect. I'm game.

1:30 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Okay, so there's that side of things, lot assistant, QR code. And then there's also the checklist app, which is kind of related to the lot assistant, I think, which is the business owner can... And the management can define, like, objectives that each of the employees needs to accomplish in their day. And then there's, like, a sequence of steps that needs to be done to perform their... There are daily tasks, weekly tasks, and it can all be captured in an application long-term, might be part of the law assistant. And then there's also the sales on the sales side of things, by the way, the lead capture and lead qualification system can also be repurposed and live on the website. As well as being attached to the QR code. So then for the sales side of things, like that's all kind of closer to the bottom of the funnel, the stuff we talked about so far. So the sales side of things we're thinking of. So there's a baseline of Facebook and meta ads data that was started off last year in 2020. About $400 a month for several months. And then there was a two month period where the ads were turned off towards the end of that. So we have some sort of baseline metrics on Facebook ads. And we want to figure out how and where to put ad dollars to scale up sales revenue through online ads.

3:26 - Chris Andrade
And cross reference the data from the sales on the inventory of just the three years worth of sales information, right? Right. To support that data, right? So we're referencing historical sales to push that media campaign.

3:52 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Yeah. And so how many of each shed has been sold? And then Um, If we can figure out how was that shed sold? Was it from in person and we don't know what their touch points were on the internet? Or do we have a little bit of information about like, how did you hear about us? Was it through a Facebook ad or was it wherever? And then in the future, we can also tie, if they have like a meta account that they're signed into, there's a thing called a pixel, which you can have installed. It's like your advertising ID, like a person's advertising ID. So on the QR code scanning, we can hook up the pixel and that can kind of link together where they came from or what the other touch points were that might not be wired up through our system.
ACTION ITEM: Draft giveaway lead-gen plan (prize/terms/promo/tracking) for Chris/Sandra - WATCH: https://fathom.video/share/bxabXKo7NvySjui2fzz2N8y35mg9BGVS?timestamp=293.9999 But it's just like Meta's track.

5:04 - Chris Andrade
And note-taker for Trent to run a cross-reference strategy for a money model strategy based off of that, just being able to create the lead funnel strategy, like, how do we entice these people to get Click that button to give me your name, phone number, email. What giveaway strategy can that look like to generate that campaign of click here, click here, right? If it's a monthly, weekly, quarterly drawing, right, how much is that drawing really got to be worth? That's where the free building comes into play, right? Like, I mean really, So curious for Trent to run a whole analysis on those type of strategies and see what he comes up with. That alone would be freaking awesome.

6:09 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
So that's like, what is the ad content going to be?

6:14 - Chris Andrade
Um, no, like a strategy to like, like social media posts. No, like, okay, Matthew, you just drove an hour to go see this dealership in the middle of nowhere off the 40 or in Flagstaff or in Tuba City, right? Sometimes people use it as an experience to go into town. Like you ever heard that concept? Gotta go in town today. Gotta go get them groceries. Oh, they stopped by SNS Wolfshed. I want to go check out that barn. Right? Now you get this folk who generally doesn't like to interact. With society or whatever, which I don't, and then I roll up to this cool dealership, god damn, look at all these buildings, some out like that barn, that's exactly what I've been looking for. Right? Oh, yo, look at, I need a, Matthew's busy, he can, I gotta go all the way over there, because it's a lot, it's an acre lot, right? And some of getting the next dealership's gonna be a two acre lot. I gotta go walk all the way over there, I got this building, look at I got 15, oh, this link, oh, scan, I got my phone, okay, well, what, I don't want my information, oh, but if it says if I give, do I get the information, like, this is what I mean, like, I could get the information for the building, oh, and if I give my, just my name and phone number, I can enter in this drawing, like, family owned drawing, me, oh, they're gonna, Thank you. Thank Like, sell my information, oh, they're just using it to help me get my building I want, and, oh, there's a community attached to if I need help with this fence or this concrete, oh, I need, you know what I mean? Like, that's the missing component that I can't figure out. Like, how do we get them to get, we don't even need their email, bro. All I need is your name and phone number. Why even add a third layer, like, less friction? My name and phone number, I'm going to send you this link, boom, here is your hyperlink interactive lot attendant, have fun, let us know if you need anything, just reply, you know? Yeah. And then, boom, we just got that person to walk into their dealership. Now, go ahead.

8:54 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Yeah. So they, they just give us their, that, that one piece of information. And maybe email is there as a field and just optional, but is required. It's like they get entered into a drawing or something, which like we can, it's, it's a, it's going to be an equation of like, okay, how much are we willing to give away? Let's just say, let's say this is what I've gone up for.

9:22 - Chris Andrade
Like the high end, the high end we can do is for. We can give away a mini shed and delivery, which again, no other dealership can offer because technically to buy that mini shed, the dealer has to buy it. And then when you buy a building, the delivery is in incorporated into the building. So there's not a delivery fee, right? So if you, if another dealer tries to sell it, they have to find somebody to take it from the dealership. So profit. That's where the building was sold at. That's where the building is to remain. Unless you have to hire a transportation company to pick up that building and move it to another location, which is add on anywhere roughly or about. Dude, the lowest to move a building is like 2,500 bucks just for me to go touch a building. Right? Okay. Yeah.

10:22 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
We're the only ones who could do that.

10:25 - Chris Andrade
So then we could actually spin up a campaign. Dude, it'll cost us $5. Grant, but the value is like a $10,000 mini delivered and installed, ready to go. Like, dude, we can spin up a campaign like that every quarter. Imagine the volume people motherfucking would get to that kind of . This is why Trent running that on the Homozy side would be invaluable because I got the whole idea from him anyways.

10:56 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Yeah. You know what saying? Trenton Larkin Yeah, so that can can So part of our kind of like proposal. We just need to communicate to Sandra that basically like, look, the profit is here. Like this is where the profit is. Like we need to hit this number with this campaign to make sure it's profitable.

11:17 - Chris Andrade
So to reference my idea here, this would be a point dedicated for the customer experience. So you get positive points and negative points. This would be a positive point. I think this is a positive point factor of five because of the value. So then it also incorporates another factor into the overall factor because you have scenarios. This scenario, because it's such a high volume, it deserves another factor of how much effort it takes, which means he's going to. So what It us $5,000, right, or maybe $6,000 in full investment. You get what I'm saying? Like that will account for two people or one person because at the end of the day, we got to associate the money we're saving them with the people it takes to create them, right? So if we create this manpower factor to do this one thing, that would take four people, eight hours to do it, right? Well, we're saying this is the benefit. That four hours.

12:45 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
To bring in this many leads, it would take people this much time? Is that what you're saying? Yeah.

12:51 - Chris Andrade
That's where the manpower factor comes in. That's why we associate.

12:55 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Yeah, typically it would take. So like, let's say. Just to bring it to a specific example, it's like Alex posting on Facebook, she takes this many hours per day doing this, and the historical data is she's generated this many leads through these posts.

13:16 - Chris Andrade
Boom. Boom. You're getting it. You're getting it. Yes. And that's the value we can represent. You feel me? Yeah.

13:28 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
The hurdle we're going to have to overcome with the giveaway side is like, how do we know that this is going to generate enough volume?

13:40 - Chris Andrade
We don't, but it gives a baseline to make it the matrix. Now we have an actual, cool. Now, if I invest in 6,000, now I have a way to track every single penny. Awesome. Before, this has been like blowing loads, dude. We call it shotgunning in the industry. We're just shotgunning. money into this Facebook meta. We're just boom, another three grand, boom, another grand, boom. And it's not even knowing where it's going. This is all we're doing is like this. And now we got three, three, eights going in at a mile out. We're hitting our on target.

14:23 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
So the risk reversal, the risk mitigation from SNS side is, okay, we're just saying that they're entered for a chance to win free delivery, right? So if there's not enough volume, like nobody wins, we can do a thing where nobody wins?

14:42 - Chris Andrade
No, I mean, we can't. don't see why we would. We just do it every quarter. Every quarter, there's a new drawing.

14:51 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Yeah, or like, maybe on the first one, there's just not a time frame. So that we're like, there's a longer time frame. So that it mitigates the risk. I'm trying to say is, like, we mitigate the risk of, like, hey, like, we only generated 10 leads, and that wasn't enough to cover the cost of the free delivery. You know what I'm saying?

15:16 - Chris Andrade
Yeah, and I would be really curious to see. This is why we need to run a whole just analysis on this alone, because this strategy is going to produce a volume. We just don't know how much, but we're trying just to be able to quantify it. And that's what we're trying to discuss. So the overall agenda still to be determined, but the emphasis to support it is what we're trying to figure out.

15:40 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
And we could even do, like, for the first one, we could do, like, instead of free delivery, you just do discounted delivery. So that mitigates risk a little bit more.

15:51 - Chris Andrade
Yeah, and honestly, let's go ahead and, like, pause on that, because, bro, I got delivery figured out. It's like, it's all logistics at that. So we don't even have to trip on that. Straight up. We just need to build the fucker just to generate the interest to see the volume of kids. Yeah. Because the point behind all this, Matt, is I'm just trying to convert that old conservative individual to when they roll up on our lots because they do roll up on our lots. And, bro, I'm telling you, we see people that haven't come to society in a while. And it's crazy.

16:32 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
It's crazy. Exactly.

16:36 - Chris Andrade
So if I can target those , right, this is how we do it. Because all they're trying is like, God damn, Barbara looked the same. That's how I got to get my phone number and I get this entry in. Okay. Like straight up. And that's what that purpose for. So we'll end it there. So then after we get this lead. For them to click that app, or to get the same information, now they're walking around, I see the hyperlink that we got. We already talked about, do you want to go over that methodology about what we talked earlier about the 30 per dealer?

17:18 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Before we get to that, I was thinking about when they're in that position where it's like, I got to walk all the way over to talk with someone, right? Like, is that a good spot to be? Because theoretically, a percentage of those people might just bounce because they might just be like, Oh, they're too busy today. I'll come back another time. And then they never do. No, they're there.

17:42 - Chris Andrade
They just have to wait sometimes, or because they have to wait, isn't there a percent chance that they just leave? That's why we're trying to, exactly why we're trying to incentivize them. That's why I say, I want a robot to show up to their cars before they even open them. And then designated parking, because right now they don't, so we designate their parking, and then from that designated parking spot, we say, hey, we have, it'd be right there as soon as they open their door. It's my problem. Yeah.

18:22 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Okay, so that's the long term. And then the short term is like, literally, as soon as they scan the thing, maybe, I don't know at what point, but we can, we can set up a chat bot, we can set up a chat bot, just any, any level of complexity, just to have them, like, we can set up a flow.
ACTION ITEM: Build MVP QR lead form (name/phone; email optional); integrate w/ new lead sheet; set attendant alerts - WATCH: https://fathom.video/share/bxabXKo7NvySjui2fzz2N8y35mg9BGVS?timestamp=1121.9999

18:43 - Chris Andrade
I do, bro, I got so much, we can write, we can go for hours on possibilities. The MVP we should be focused on is, what is that? And I think to get started, all we, and really, all we need is the name and phone number, we are. We have an existing spreadsheet with all the customers, all the emails, all the sales, I guess compiled on the one document. So we would just need to branch off of that internal main source of truth and start collecting a new source of truth. You know, and then from there, let's just start creating our new spreadsheet with the new tracking system and that's it. Can we connect that point from when they give us their information to a spreadsheet?

19:36 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Yeah, we can store the information. But I'm thinking that this lot assistant might be like a chat bot that might be very quick to do. Like once literally might be phase two, but it might be like literally just if we have any version of like the sales SOP, like literally we can feed that PDF. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. You guys already sent over with the process, and it can just be something that they chat with while they're waiting, and it can kind of, like, sell them on it a little bit, just so they don't, it reduces the bounce rate. Right.

20:15 - Chris Andrade
And that, my emphasis is, as long as we, like, MVP, Phase 1, as long as I can say, we can say, Sandra, by us just putting this hyperlink on your buildings and replacing your numerical system that you already used, just by implementing these identified tags on the buildings, this is what you get, right?

20:46 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Yeah.

20:47 - Chris Andrade
And then, so then we just paint the picture. So now, we already have, and we can use the instance that you did with Austin, like, we know this is working, right? Yeah. Thank you. Hi.

20:59 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Go on. on. Bye.

21:00 - Chris Andrade
We don't have a way to capture the ones that are organically coming in, which, honestly, are the most important ones, because those are the ones who have invested interest.
ACTION ITEM: Define designated parking; design/order signage; install at lots - WATCH: https://fathom.video/share/bxabXKo7NvySjui2fzz2N8y35mg9BGVS?timestamp=1272.9999 So we're focusing on the ones who kind of are wishy-washy. We are already filtering out, let's just say, 70% by just incorporating this. Boom. Now, by incorporating these hyperlinks with this structured parking, that's the key component here, because everybody kind of just rolled up to this dealership, and they don't know where to park. And I'm like, oh, . Okay, so I need to fix that. And I'm like, okay, now if I put a sticker there, now they're going to be like, oh, welcome, thanks for taking your time. Oh, all I got, like, are you looking for prices on anything? Here, if you don't, just scan this and have fun. Our representative will be, it just got alerted that you just got, you just showed up on. Because again, the lot is huge, dude. Sometimes they want to just show up and they want to pull up to the building. Because theoretically, kind of can at Williams. You can just pull your car into the dealership, scan the hyperlink right out of your front door, not even have to get out of your car. And if it's right then and there, oh, we just noticed that you showed up, but you haven't registered. Can you just give us your name and phone number and we'll alert the attendant that you're here. And here's the price of the building. Thank you. Boom.

22:36 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Yeah, we got to do that as soon as possible.

22:38 - Chris Andrade
And then we are now we just turn on a whole other switch of flea funnel generation that they never even thought possible.

22:46 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
I see it because it's like, right when they get there. Like, does anybody even know I'm here? Like, where do I go? Exactly. No, no, you don't.

22:55 - Chris Andrade
And it kills me, bro. And listen, okay, it's very important that to there. Nobody hears this except us, okay? Like, straight up. But my family are not physically active. In fact, they avoid physical stuff. Hello, dog. Damn, you scared the out of me. You, they avoid physical things. Because unfortunately, it's in our biological genes, bro. And this is my internal struggle that I battle every single day. And these are my little brothers. And it kills me that I can't get through to them. So, why I'm saying this is because they don't want to get out of their chairs because it's too comfortable. You feel me?

23:54 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Yeah.

23:55 - Chris Andrade
So because of that, I have to kind of, kind of be like, I kind of got to be a dick. Yeah.

24:02 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
My parents are pretty similar. Like they don't, especially my mom, my dad is more like he was an athlete and stuff, but now he's like, I mean, there's other reasons why he doesn't, but he, he stays active actually. But my mom, she avoids physical. She doesn't like it. And she, she eats a lot of food. So I get where you're coming from. And I'm just like, why is that true to her?

24:25 - Chris Andrade
But yeah, you know, you know what I found out after years and years of trying, bro. Now, knowing that I have kids, right. And now, now I have these new humans of life. They like causes me like, I want you to be more around them longer than your mom and my grandma, because my grandma was in it sucks. And I don't want my kids to say that straight up. And that's honestly, if you Boil this all down. If I didn't care, I would not be even doing this, Matthew. But I am sure, like, this is what I mean. They don't know what they don't know. They don't know what they need. And so I have to go to these lengths to show them, which is ultimately what made me so good. I've been trying to figure this out for a long time, bro. And this is why I love the way you're breaking it out, because the gaps that you need to answer, I already know. You just got to ask the question.

25:37 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Yeah. It's like, all right, like, if I had a magic wand and I could create any application, what would that look like? Besides the stuff that we just talked about, like, you know, there's a so there's a QR code link that they can scan as soon as they park.

25:55 - Chris Andrade
So then once we have the way. To address who we have, meaning all the customers are logged, categorized, systemized, right, in a way that we know a little bit of context of who we have, right, why they came here, right, what did they get, what are they looking for, right? I have all of the three years worth of data sets alone to support that. I want to be able to reference this in a way that I can talk to Claude and be like, hey, listen, I, it looks like we're going to get snow this week. I'm not going to be able to have anybody show up to the dealerships. I need to spin up an ad campaign like now so we can compensate for this no cow. That we're about to generate, and I need to turn on an online, like, how does that look? Right? Because if we have our sales to reference, we are going to see the time of the year, because this is an occurrence that happens every year, because when it snows, we can't go to the lot. So then now I have four, five unpaid employees doing .

27:31 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Yeah. But they're still getting paid. So but they can be they can be doing social media stuff like, hey, it's again.

27:40 - Chris Andrade
We got that are like, because we're because there's no because there's no reference. That's why Claude. Now my mom or Matthew would be the one to actually delegate. Matthew will be set up to interact with Claude and be like, hey, I need I Austin to, like, or create me an agenda for today, right? And I have Austin, he's available for three hours, Alex is available for four, give me a to-do list for them to make sure this gets done. Boom. And once we are able to delegate remotely like that on a conference, like a day by day, because not every day is the same. Right? And if we can have something to help strategize our marketing efforts to support an online presence versus a physical presence, that's what I'm trying to get at. Because, bro, once we figure that out, I can go nationwide. Yeah.

28:53 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Well, have an idea. So, like, whenever there's a slow season, you can run a promotion that's just It's like you post, you think of, you plan out, so somebody's going to to plan out the market. That's right.

29:05 - Chris Andrade
So again, Trent, the note taker. So let's put this for the note taker. So we have the other reference to the Homozi AI database or research, whatever strategy that we need to come up with on this topic. Yeah.

29:21 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
And then, but also, so, so definitely, yes, we got to do that. And then also, like, so when they're creating that marketing campaign, ideally, you want to do that, you want to do the planning and do that stuff before the slow season before the snow comes, in your case, when it's snow time, when it's snowing, and there's nobody coming in, the salespeople, instead of talking to people on the lot, what they're doing, they're on social media, DMing people, leaving comments, media, DMing people, you need a need to do is and I

30:00 - Chris Andrade
And that email campaign and follow up on your delivery list. So, okay. Matthew, love you. This is another priority.
ACTION ITEM: Document post-contract delivery timeline; draft customer follow-up script - WATCH: https://fathom.video/share/bxabXKo7NvySjui2fzz2N8y35mg9BGVS?timestamp=1807.9999 Even if I can create a secondary list to like everybody, there's a timeline, a sequence of events that need to be analyzed. And Matthew will have a better. So this would be a part of the interview question for Matthew. I need to know the sequence of events from after the time of the contract being signed. And we need to create a follow up assistant to support the clients. And cause sometimes what happens is that Graceland drops the ball and then we think everything's good. And then we don't, we, and then next thing we know, we get a pissed off call from the customer saying, Hey, I haven't heard from Graceland. What the 's going on. We're like, God damn it. Graceland again. So then here we go. So. Oh, I, I, they. This follow-up sequence, and then after the follow-up sequence, and then we know that the delivery is good, we wish, do you, Mr. Customer, do you have any documents you'd like me to send to your driver, right? Because we can't automate that yet, but if we can create a system to create a follow-up call to get that document before the delivery, along that sequence, it will make Grace or SNS stand out. That's that filler time that I need to find for Matthew and Austin on a daily basis, right?

31:35 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
So just to dive into detail, just so I understand, as well as the note-taker, like on the follow-up scenario, is it like Graceland is supposed to follow up certain things, but what you guys can do is you can check in with the customer and say, Right. Like, did you get the message from Graceland? Did you get this message from them? Did you get this from them? We're just checking in because sometimes about don't have Sometimes our fulfillment company, you know, like, we just want to make sure that they're getting everything. No, yeah, we're taking a, we'll just sum it up to this.

32:10 - Chris Andrade
We are taking the initiative to make sure that they are supporting our means of standards. Because we had instances and so we created this to make your experience at a five star level here. That's all. You know what mean?

32:29 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Yeah.

32:30 - Chris Andrade
And then we even had all, and we're going to even have to create that script too, for them to really, again, that's what this is a part of the followup process is, okay, now we have the time, who the bot to manage that, then the, and then how, what are they supposed to say? Right.

32:52 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
That's where we need that.

32:54 - Chris Andrade
That's a part of that. that. To support it. To close it. They're uniform. That's part Because this is a system, that approach alone, bro, once we can figure out how much money we're going to make just off of that, and we don't have to spend a dollar in marketing ads, all I got to do is assign a task to a person, had to do every, make three, four, four calls every day, and I just generated another hundred grand of revenue.

33:21 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Yeah. It's like, what is, what do they, what do we need to tell them to do? Because if we're not giving them tasks, they're not going to do anything because it's, they don't need to know what to do, like what you said before. So it's like, we can, we can, as long as we have a high level plan and it all hooks into like, this is going to generate more sales, then it makes sense and can, and and then, so now Matthew's the overall manager, right?

33:48 - Chris Andrade
So Matthew has his overall managing clot. Who's to say that that managing clot can't be developed into a notion of other assistant clods attached to the manager to delegate. To the individual at the dealership, so then technically each dealership would need its own Notion, right? So then now Notion flags out its own system and its own database, its own sales, its own strategy, its own referencing. Dude, that would be crazy. Yeah.

34:18 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
So like one, something that Trent was showing me with Cowork is like you can basically, you know how with CloudCode OS, we need to use CloudCode and we need to do all this like stuff with like the coding and the pushing and pulling and whatever from GitHub. Right. So like what Cowork does is it just connects directly to your file system on your local computer. So like maybe each person at each dealership can have their own set of documents for that.

35:04 - Chris Andrade
Okay, so you're touching on something that I was talking about this morning. Because another problem we have at these dealerships is that there's no power. Right? So we're in the middle of nowhere. So then we have to rely on a generator. Right? Well, our, our internet is provided off a generator. I want to incorporate Starlink and have it just, we have to , like, I got this whole trailer set up, this whole ready to go. It's a whole security monitoring trailer that has its own Starlink. Right? And what I'm trying, because what we're having at Tuba City specifically, we get a lot of break-ins.
ACTION ITEM: Evaluate Starlink security trailer hub feasibility/ROI; report to Chris - WATCH: https://fathom.video/share/bxabXKo7NvySjui2fzz2N8y35mg9BGVS?timestamp=2149.9999 And when we get a break-in, it costs us money. Well... If I connect, the idea is, and I would love to hear Trent's thought process on this, is if I connected the security trailer, attached it to the office, because then we turned the office and the security trailer and turn it into a hub for that dealer, because all of our buildings are attached, all of our offices are portable, right? Because they're built in these Graceland buildings, right? So then if whatever happens to the building or the dealership, it all moves integrally, right? But the point here is to create the security systems connected to an infinite source of power to supply an infinite connection, because the only resource we have are using rings, and it's stuck. And in ring cameras, like the ones on your door, So then we always have, like, I need a dedicated, I need a dedicated line in 24 seven. And what that will do is give us the ability to create. And they already have these internal little servers. They already have their , like, dude, imagine, imagine if we were able, instead of using data, and if each dealership provided its own data. then when, when somebody rolled up to their lot, they don't have to have connectivity. They're not because sometimes that is an issue is that there's not internet service. So then if the dealer becomes the internet service, it eliminates so many things.

37:50 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Yeah, their QR code scan might not work if they don't have connectivity. it'll increase.

37:56 - Chris Andrade
Luckily, right now, it's not an issue, but it can It be on scalability. So if we offered this little package, this is where the implementation fee comes in to implement and install this hardware configuration to connect your dealership to turn it into its own hub, lot, network to ensure that your customers can communicate to you 24-7. Yeah. And all it takes is to have a dedicated Starlink.

38:32 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Like a coffee shop level. Yeah, exactly.

38:38 - Chris Andrade
Exactly. And then what's the ROI on something like that? Well, we have to know how many people are coming into the lot first, right? Do you see how well thought out I have this , bro? I hope that just illustrated. Yeah. I have all this ready to go. Oh, bro. I'd just be curious if I say I'd be interested to see what Trent said because, dude, if we can build that on our own and it only costs us $3,000, but I can write a $15,000 invoice to it all day.

39:16 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Yep, yep.

39:17 - Chris Andrade
And then, ooh, you need support for that? Boom. Another client that we've got to create a service plan for. Oh, you just bought yourself a premium package. Yeah, like you want to know why SNS leveled up their game?

39:34 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Yeah. And they started getting off, like they partnered with the Rise Group. Yep.

39:42 - Chris Andrade
Boom. And then what happens to them is then they become the subject matter experts. And then once everyone sees like how much more dominating, like how much they're dominating their local markets. personal experience. for for Thanks And they're going to be like, God damn, dude. What the are you guys doing, Chris? Chris is what happened. They're like, what? I'll call Chris. He'll tell you. Just call Chris. I can't wait for that moment, bro, because I know it's going to happen. I just don't know when. Yeah.

40:19 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Yeah. I mean, I think we don't like, I'm sure there's more of I'm talking about right now, but I think we've, we already have just from what you've been talking about, we already have enough to start to update that proposal. I think it's a good idea to have like a, maybe we come to you because we're going to want to do round two of the proposal thing.
ACTION ITEM: Finish man-hour/CX factor model; share w/ Matthew - WATCH: https://fathom.video/share/bxabXKo7NvySjui2fzz2N8y35mg9BGVS?timestamp=2449.9999 So maybe we have like a gamma presentation of the overview. And then we have a master document. Like what do you talked about in the call today with more? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

40:55 - Chris Andrade
I love that. Yep. Yep. Yep. Mm hmm. That's why I want to finish up this document, bro, because I'm really curious to see what this man-hour factor calculation will do for us, because I really, truly feel like that's going to be all our visual representation we need. I just need another eight hours worth of maker work, bro. That's all I need. I just need a make for a solid eight hours. I'll have it figured out.

41:26 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Okay. For which part?

41:30 - Chris Andrade
For the man-hour factor, the customer experience factor, and to figure out a way to build some sort of referenceable data table, to build some sort of analytical... I don't even know how to word it yet, bro. Like, hey, let me just talk this out while I'm walking my way home. Yeah. I'm trying to create a one-to-one ratio for every hour... of work that somebody is on, whether it's a dealership or plotter mechanics. You have one employee. That one employee can accommodate so many points per day in their eight-hour shift. I'm trying to figure out a way to create the task, associate a point system to the task specific for the client, to have some sort of reference value per employee brings to the company existing moment in time. Upon our conversation. This is where you sit. Then, we have our discovery call. We gain. We a little bit of insight. We get an understanding of what possibilities exist with what the economics BDF shows is that we can create our own point system. And then my idea is to create our man hour factor to a point system to get an added value to understand that we can turn one man hour into 1.75 for this one task by implementing this. So you gain 0.75 on this one task. And then we can go systematically through the task we already have created. To get a value per task. Does that make sense? Yeah, yeah. And then I know I can do it, bro. I know I can create it. It's right here in front of me. I just got to put my mind to paper. Yeah.

44:19 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
And I mean, you can, even this, what you just explained, you can pull that from the transcript on this call to get you started.

44:27 - Chris Andrade
Well, I, I, so that's why I'm going, I'm calculating the point system through the PDF right now. So I'm already, I'm already got, yeah, I already, cause you already got started. Yep. So I already have my point system started. I already see it. I just got to finish it.

44:46 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Yeah. Nice. I mean, do you want to work on that right now before the call or do you want to, uh, well, it's kind of hard because it's on my remarkable.

44:57 - Chris Andrade
Wait, I can actually. actually. I mean, yeah, technically I can. I just got home. Hold on. Give me one second. I gotta take a week. Hold on. Let switch to my computer real quick.

45:10 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Hi, sweetie.

45:12 - Chris Andrade
What did you guys make? What? You made a little zipline? That's freaking cool. That's what I'm talking about. Way to be creative, sweetie. Freaking it. Oh, uh-oh. Hold on. Hi, Mom. How's it going? I just got back from a walk. We're actually, I'm on the phone with Matthew. We figured out a solution, ultimately, but we're just trying to put it all together right now. So you're on speakerphone with Matthew.

45:44 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
That's Andrew.

45:46 - Chris Andrade
Switching out to you. Um, hold on. I got, let me take my headset off. Hold on, Mom.

45:54 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Can you, can she hear me? Can you hear me, Sandra?

45:57 - Chris Andrade
Matthew, can you hear me? Yeah, can hear you, Chris. Yeah, Matthew, Mom, this is Matthew from the Arise Group. Oh, okay. Hi, Matthew.

46:07 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Hi, how are you doing?

46:09 - Chris Andrade
Hey, Matthew was, I'm sorry, I just jumped in. Sorry, Matthew, or Mom, Matthew said how you were doing. Oh, good, good. Sorry, I just got back from a walk. I'm all hyped up right now, because we just got a lot of clarity on what we need to do. Um, we, uh, I was like, oh, uh, Matthew was doing some testing. And he did, like, he did, like, what we call, we secret shopped SNS bullshits. And, uh, Austin called Matthew right up. And, tell her, tell her, tell, tell my mom what you said, Matthew.

46:54 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Well, so, uh, that email, uh, you already, Sandra, you already, you were. So to the, I submitted something on just testing out the website. And then you replied like perfect to that one. I think you said thank you. And then what that system that you guys have set up is I ended up getting a call from Austin. So that was good that it works for like leads coming out. Okay, cool. Yeah.

47:28 - Chris Andrade
Did he answer your questions, though?

47:32 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Uh, well, so I wasn't really, I just, I wasn't really thinking that I was going to get a call. And so I didn't have anything prepared to ask him questions. I didn't do a great job with a secret shopper. wasn't even really planning on it. I didn't even know that that would happen.

47:51 - Chris Andrade
So, but Yeah, we usually get back to them within the hour or two hours of getting them. Unless it's on our day off. Got it.

48:03 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Nice. Okay, so SLA. That's the time they try to shoot for. Got it. Yeah.

48:15 - Chris Andrade
Okay, so... That's good.

48:18 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Yeah, speed to lead is important.

48:21 - Chris Andrade
Yeah, before they change their mind. Yeah.

48:27 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Okay.

48:28 - Chris Andrade
