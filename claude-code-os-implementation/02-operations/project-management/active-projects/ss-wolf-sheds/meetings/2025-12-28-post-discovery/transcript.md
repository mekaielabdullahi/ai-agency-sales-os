I've been having so many issues with Fathom today, but I'm pretty sure this one's recording.

0:17 - Trent Christopher
I am trying to build Loom. Loom has a meeting recorder, but we'll see how it goes.

0:26 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Cool.

0:29 - Chris Andrade
Oh man, I am so tired. It's the holidays for fun, but god damn, Kurt. It takes so much effort for one day. I know.

0:52 - Trent Christopher
Wait for a boy.

0:57 - Chris Andrade
Let me go ahead and... Let me this in here while you guys are waiting. Let me know if you got access to that. What is this?

1:17 - Trent Christopher
Oh, one second.

1:21 - Chris Andrade
Chip, what's up, buddy? I'm actually in the meeting with the guys. I was just seeing if you want any of this. Oh, damn. Yeah, I just hopped on this meeting, going over workbook one. Oh, yeah, my fault, bro. You don't have work tomorrow morning, right? Well, hit me up when you wake up, and if you want to do that, I'll be down. Bye. So I just shared the link, Mekaiel.

1:56 - Mekaiel Abdullahi
Hello.

1:56 - Chris Andrade
What's up, buddy? What up? Bye.

1:59 - Mekaiel Abdullahi
Joe.

2:00 - Chris Andrade
What we're looking at is a folder in this SOT, right, for workbook one. You share it?

2:15 - Mekaiel Abdullahi
It's in the chat. It's in the chat.

2:19 - Chris Andrade
And then if you guys can hone in to the PDF of B1 SOT, keys to the castle. I think I don't I don't see the thing in the chat.
ACTION ITEM: Upload SOT v1 'Keys to the Castle' to Slack for Trent, Matthew, Mekaiel - WATCH: https://fathom.video/share/DB8EPPNDUmnRMsex7xSZCoaeAq5kCXXw?timestamp=153.9999

2:32 - Mekaiel Abdullahi
I think you shared it before doing it here. I'll send you a you're talking about the other.

2:44 - Chris Andrade
And this is the we should probably put it in the slack, too.

2:51 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Yeah, I'll put it.

2:52 - Chris Andrade
I'll I'll actually upload everything up to it. I was just sorry.

2:56 - Mekaiel Abdullahi
Yeah, we can work however you guys want to do it.

3:00 - Chris Andrade
This is the one that I, so if you go down and you're going to see a PDF, this is called the source of truth. What I have done here is ultimately map out what I think is the solution of what honestly meant me to you guys. This is how I, this is how I got here. This is like a big moment for me because we, you know, the whole reason why we're all sitting here is because of that document. And I believe that this is the missing piece to SNS and also the whole Graceland infrastructure. What you're looking at. I kind of did a good, I tried to do as best as I could to kind of give a table of context. And I think I asked you, Trent, initially about how I should separate it. Because my thought here is, we can upload this source of truth v1 document to our OS or how that's described, and ultimately use that as reference with what we just used or got from the information from S&S Woolsheds, right? And then now I feel like we have a pretty good idea of what minimum viable product we can offer these guys right out the gate. Now, I woke up last night at three o'clock in the morning because I had an, I don't know, I had a, I remember what I was telling you about, like literally waking up and writing notes in my bed, in my sleep? Yeah. That happened, and And I came and wrote on my board, I don't know, like this, like came to me in the middle of the night, it was, you know, how we were just discovering like, a brand or like an AI champion for companies, right? I think it's cool to have maybe specialty versions of champions, like, for instance, for SNS Wolf Sheds, I think it would be cool to help them with like a AI champion, but geared for branding and marketing, right? Because I seen, I have it on my phone, can I switch? I want to show you guys something here. So I'm going to switch to, oh, we're not, I can't do it. Well, I seen this YouTube video, or I'm scrolling on my Facebook and And there's this freaking AI, know it's AI generated, but it's a whole marketing like video and what they did with buildings and it getting delivered down the road. And I'm like, damn, like that's some good marketing stuff, right? And I'm like, well, if we can train my sister how to use AI to make better marketing videos or marketing pictures or come up with some prompts that can be used in their marketing aspect to help gear up their social media presence, like that would speak volumes and that would be really cool for them to build that champion up with them. And that could be something that we could offer right away. But now, my source of truth that you guys have here can ultimately, I guess now it's for you to tell me, like, am I crazy, right? Like, now we have the... The to the castle of what I think, gentlemen, we can charge a monthly fee to manage other people's dealerships. And the cool thing about it is that it doesn't have to be just portable buildings. Like, if you break it down, it can be inventory management of a multitude of different types of things that are on the sides of the road or any kind of inventory management for opportunities, you know?

7:43 - Mekaiel Abdullahi
Wow.

7:44 - Chris Andrade
I realize that there's a lot. I mean, I think it's like, what, 295 pages of just crazy documents? Yeah. I don't know how you guys want to, like, is there questions that when you're looking at this, like, like, throw it at me. Like, what are your thoughts? So you're like, what do you think?

8:02 - Trent Christopher
Where do we start would be the question first. So the prompt breakdown, prompt results, master sheet, Word document, project summary, value proposition. That's what I was looking at.

8:30 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
So is this accurate? The goal of this project is to build a single interconnected Excel Google Sheets seven sheet workbook that transforms static product information into dynamic quantifiable business management tool. This system is designed to solve critical pain points and logistics and profitability by quantifying business value, calculating the true cost of doing business, and demonstrating ROI of marketing consulting fees, streamlining sales, providing single interface. Pricing the lookup tool for a quick, accurate shed configuration and quote generation, and then three, enhancing customer service, solving the last mile delivery problem by linking delivery drivers to client-provided custom maps and access instructions.

9:14 - Chris Andrade
So, I mean, I think we have a couple iterations that we've talked about since. believe initially, like this is like literally version one, right? And we've, I think, and touched on a couple other projects at the same time of how things would like interact with each other, right? I, but at the sense of the, at the end of the day, yes, that is the basis of it. And that's kind of how the original idea became. And then shortly after our discussions and just understanding what possibilities there are, I mean, it's been morphed like a lot, right?

9:59 - Mekaiel Abdullahi
That.

10:00 - Chris Andrade
But at the base of it, this is kind of just at the core of what could be beneficial or if there was a way that we could just get the inventory manager with the CRM, like that could be implemented day one, right? That would be beneficial for the lot, right? Or is it the, like, listen, there's so much, so many ways to skin this cat. It's just like, how now do we come up with the MVP for wolf sheds at this point, right? And which avenue do we think is the best route for us to pursue? I mean, we know that there's a lot.

11:00 - Mekaiel Abdullahi
Yeah, I would say there is a lot, but what I would be interested in before that would be to how you came to the workbook. I mean, obviously, like, yeah, what the goal of the workbook is, is kind of, like, yeah, CRM and stuff, but more like, why? Like, why implement it this way? Like, what's the goal behind it? Like, what's the end goal and the solution that we're looking for? And then maybe just work backwards from there.

11:28 - Chris Andrade
So, um, yeah, not be on my computer. Oh, I know what I can do. Give me one second. I can share my list.

11:44 - Mekaiel Abdullahi
So the goal kind of is to create a master inventory and pricing log for different shred models and their customizable options. And then for the user, a sales representative or internal stock needing to quickly look up specs and generate

12:01 - Chris Andrade
So the original idea here is to create a lot of tenants. So if somebody was to roll up onto the dealership, they would interact with the hyperlink. The hyperlink would be able to, like, they would be incentivized to give us their name, phone number, and email. Then, from that ability, they'd be like, okay, walk along the dealership, scan the hyperlink, right? And then get your information about the building, right?

12:35 - Mekaiel Abdullahi
Sure. Based on.

12:37 - Chris Andrade
And then, like, the analytic data of how long in between, how many buildings they walk through, how long did they spend inside the buildings, right? Like, you get it, right? And then, then that's where the, because a lot of the issues that, like, they talked about is, like, sometimes if there's 15 people, or 10 people, or five. We people at a dealership and we only have one attendant, right? Who's to say that out of that five people, one of them was able to slip away without even being noticed, right? And I'm trying to capture those guys. And how do we capture them? Well, if we incentivize them and make them go to the hyperlinks to get the information that they're seeking, that they drove an hour to go get? They could have came to their website. That's how they found us. But then they took it the next step, right? They're like, damn, I want to go see this. Then they drove all the way over there.

13:39 - Mekaiel Abdullahi
It's those ones are the ones that we're losing that I'm trying to capture.

13:43 - Chris Andrade
So again, if we use the hyperlink to capture them and to incentivize them, now we gain a marketing portfolio that they can reach out for their ads, their campaigns. And like their monthly deals, right? But now we turn the lead to actually get more, you know, that could be turned into a sale down the road. Just I'm trying to figure out a way to stop the sieve from leaking. That's what initially was my initial. And then I was like, connect the hyperlink to the building, right? And then we're providing a portfolio to like now when they drive away from the lot, they're going to be reaching that geofence. And then like get an automatically prompt. Oh, here's a report of all the buildings you scan. And just want to say, thank you. You know, just so you know, there's a sale come the sale on this and this building is going to end next week. You know, future sales coming up. Like, you know what I'm saying?

14:46 - Mekaiel Abdullahi
Yeah, I get the video to them, you know, an interactive way to handle your customers and to gather leads, to build, like to build a lead list, to build like. Curate that customer and client, as well as like some type of like, like interactive like way, so like, I get it, they show up to the shed, scan something, whatever, they get info or like interact with an agent, get information on that, so it would have to carry to like some type of internal backend, like, you know, like database and structure, and then all that kind of ties back into the website, and everything else in an internal, so that makes sense, and then the workbook is kind of how to get there, right? Right.

15:29 - Trent Christopher
So, is there anything quantified, or is that one of the points of your, your system is that right now you don't even know?

15:39 - Chris Andrade
Right, we don't even, like there's, there's so much out there to grasp, as far as what can be quantified, like the analytical data behind it is just kind of unreal, the opportunities that the dealer can gain on their clients, or their customers that are coming in, you know?

15:59 - Mekaiel Abdullahi
Right.

16:00 - Chris Andrade
And then be able to do specific targeting campaigns for people who just want a greenhouse versus the ones who want shipping containers or a metal building. Someone's looking for a 50 by 100 foot garage, not a little 10 by 20. know what I mean? Like there's, there's, or, or again, some people just need somebody who can build a pond or a septic system or a concrete pad, or that's where then the contractors come into play, you know, and again, the idea behind the lot attendance is to take the customer service out of the deal, like Graceland, because they're the ones dropping the balls all the time, and giving them the dealer a platform for For the customers to feel like they're getting taken care of, right? And so the customers, that's where all the knowledge bases, the information on how to anchor your buildings, they'll, the customer. We'll keep coming back no matter how many, if they buy their building, because now we're giving them all the information for the customer to keep interacting with that dealer. So then we turn that one customer into a revolving door because we're giving them all that, how to maintain your building. Oh, hey, by the way, if you go to our app or whatever, you get entered into a special drawing. Like, you know what I mean? Like the opportunities are so endless with the HOMOC plan.

17:30 - Mekaiel Abdullahi
Yeah, that's what I was getting.

17:32 - Trent Christopher
I was going to say, like you were talking about the hyperlinks. The first thing I think of with a hyperlinks is that it should make it easier for the client. But the prospect may come and they look at the sheds. Right. But then also, if you want to encourage them, even if it's only for a short period of time, you need to give something to them.

17:49 - Mekaiel Abdullahi
Right.

17:49 - Trent Christopher
And even if it's just like that rush of, hey, I get to put, be put in a drawing to save 500 bucks on my shed or whatever it is. Right. So. And you.

18:00 - Chris Andrade
It would cost us $2,600 for an 8x10 mini-shed, and then let's say if I throw another $2,500 in an ad campaign to run for a month to push for that mini-shed, and then now we're pushing that ad campaign to all of our ad users, and because you're an app follower, you get two entries or whatever, you know what I mean?

18:25 - Trent Christopher
Yeah, yeah, Ways to encourage people to provide their information to you, to engage with the client, the prospect, right? And then get them to be interested in what you have to offer. Exactly. Yep.

18:39 - Chris Andrade
And then, like, imagine how many, like, damn, I can win a building, I can win a freaking shed delivery, and because my dad is the transportation company, we're the only ones who can do that, because the other companies, he's the other, they rely on Graceland to supply the delivery. My parents are the only ones who could actually say, no, no, we don't need you Graceland, I got my own . I got my own trailer, my own equipment. I can do whatever I want to with my customers. Yeah, I can sell them a building and deliver them a building and you can't say . You know what I mean?

19:20 - Trent Christopher
So this workbook one, you're talking about, you know, you're providing basically like everything that on the table, right? And you have all these ideas and you've clearly created a lot of detail in here. And you're saying that what we probably need to try to do is narrow down MVP. And so that would be one of my questions is, is there any way that you have already quantified or any way that you have already identified the the hottest things that are on the list? I already have some in my head, but I'm curious what you would say would be the biggest impact in the shortest timeframe.

20:09 - Chris Andrade
And that's why I've been not really wanting to push it, because we've been working tangibly on other problems, like that overlapping effect that we've been touching on. You can see that we've been overlapping a lot of our other towards this, right? But at the end of the day, what I think, and I'd be curious to see what you guys think, is that I think, take aside my parents' involvement, I think if there was a way to immediately capture or create those leads that come naturally by going through the dealerships and forcing them to give us their information to capture the buildings, right? The hyperlink system to lock in that client.

21:03 - Trent Christopher
Yeah, so you're thinking just a very minimalistic, minimalistic system that you can start to implement with this hyperlink system, right? The idea is that you are going to collect information to gather from your clients, and you're also going to provide some level of engagement with the client, right? So that hopefully they're getting a slightly different experience than what they're used to or expecting. And it would be like nobody else even has anything remotely close to it.

21:32 - Chris Andrade
Like, listen, my parents just put a number one on the side of a building. All they did was print it in a 82 font, throw it in a laminator, stuck it on the side of a building, and Graceland thought they were the , you know? Yeah, yeah.

21:52 - Trent Christopher
So can we, can we just, maybe you already have it detailed out, but can you just... Maybe a high level. Detail that out again.

22:03 - Mekaiel Abdullahi
Can you see my screen here?

22:05 - Chris Andrade
Yeah, there we go.

22:06 - Mekaiel Abdullahi
Yeah, I can see it. So this is where I kind of started. I was trying to prepare for this as best as possible.

22:14 - Chris Andrade
So as the dealer, as you come in, right, this is the first step, is that the interaction, that they will scan the link, right? That's the first thing that I'm trying to accomplish. Can you see it? it too small? No, I can see it. It's just I'm on my laptop screen and then we're also inside of the meeting, right?

22:37 - Trent Christopher
So then it's, I don't know if I can make yours full screen. Yeah, I can make yours full screen. So that'll work.

22:44 - Chris Andrade
Okay, so the it kind of just breaks it down to, I think the first initial scan with that link, we're getting all of this information, right? Being able to just I'm We're designed to centralize hyperlink management dashboard that allows a lot of attendance and CRM managers to create, track, and modify all of the URLs used in customer communication. Can we pause on that for a second?

23:16 - Trent Christopher
Yep.

23:17 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
So let's say I'm thinking two things. So there's like a QR code. like the simplest thing we could do is set up one QR code that goes on every building and it just links to the website and it prompts you to log in and then you can log in.

23:39 - Mekaiel Abdullahi
Like a user form, right?

23:42 - Trent Christopher
That you have to give your information, maybe not a login, right? Sure. Yeah.

23:46 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Just, just capture their email, right? Yeah. So the simplest thing is just capture the email. Then what the other thing was, okay, there's a unique QR code for ... Chris, what you want, right? We know which building they're interested in, which one you scan. At a minimum, like, yeah, you're right.

24:11 - Trent Christopher
The lowest hanging fruit, if you want to give this experience, is to create a QR code that literally just goes to the website, to a user, like an intake form on the website. So then the next level is to create unique codes that you put on every shed that when they scan it, it might still only go to an intake form, but it'll have a parameter in there that it feeds us, telling us where it came from, right? Which QR code was the one that actually they scanned. So it was the one that they were interested in, right? But then the next thing is, is what if they scan another one, right? So now you need to track that same user has now scanned a second QR code, keep history on that particular user. So how does that work?

24:56 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
So what if, what if we What if we have them type in instead of like, it's a lot of, it's gonna be a lot of work to set up QR codes for every building and maintain that as new sheds come in, right? What if we just have them type in the building number that's on the side of the building at first? I thought about that.

25:18 - Chris Andrade
And my thought was, is like, every dealership only can do, let's just say 20 buildings, right? They can't have more than 20 buildings on that lot. Right.

25:30 - Mekaiel Abdullahi
make, just make 20 QR codes. then. Exactly. And then.

25:34 - Trent Christopher
Building one always has the same QR code. Building two always has the same bar. Right.

25:40 - Chris Andrade
That's what I initially thought is if we designate an inventory management on, on slot numbers and then, and then we can allocate that, that the, that then it would be okay. Now the only thing that the variable would be just that. The, the, specific. And what's cool about the specifications is that it's a copy from the – can I do it from here? Give me one second. I think I showed you, Matthew, how the buildings look, like the serial numbers. Oh, cool. I do have access to it. Give me one second. It's on the discovery call, too.

26:25 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
then as part of the process for, like, rolling out a new shed to a slot, you would just have someone update the back end and be like – Yeah, they're already doing that, right?

26:35 - Trent Christopher
So they already have a process where they know what one, shed one, is, right? So or shed two. They already have that.

26:43 - Chris Andrade
So can you see my screen? We can.

26:46 - Trent Christopher
It's – you know, all the print is small, but I can see the branch on two.

26:50 - Chris Andrade
So this is this is – this is SNS's inventory for Tuba City, right? So this is how every building – Is is described, right? We're saying we're seeing the diagram. Oh, yeah.

27:07 - Trent Christopher
Is that what you're saying?

27:08 - Mekaiel Abdullahi
No. Stop.

27:10 - Chris Andrade
I think I was sharing.

27:17 - Mekaiel Abdullahi
Oh, that's why. Boom.

27:24 - Chris Andrade
The specific window thing always gets me.

27:27 - Trent Christopher
It's so. Yeah. So the Oh, we just lost Chris. He dropped out of the call. But I don't have a lot of experience with taking a QR code and trying to track it. But on if we can send it to a system somehow, there's one. Once it's in like a webhook or- I think there has to be like some type of inventory management CRM or system that we could tie into- Your microphone's not working. You're muted. I'm not good on the Macintosh.

28:18 - Chris Andrade
I'm not good on- I'm still working.

28:21 - Trent Christopher
I've been using mine for, I don't know, five years and I'm still learning.

28:27 - Chris Andrade
It's just, I haven't got my baby. Like, dude, I have not had any time yet. And it's just like, it's been a little contingent moment with my wife. So I have to be nice. I have to be nice. Okay. So, Sandra, now, I don't know why, but when I tried to share my screen, it was not happening. So now share window. There we go. There we go. Okay. Now you guys can see. You guys can see. So this is S&S, this is Tuba. So I'm logging into Graceland's portal here, right? So here's my inventory manager. So you see, like, this is what's so cool is that you see the description in the building. This is all of it's the same. So the serial number. This is the serial number, right? Yep.

29:37 - Trent Christopher
GSX stands for garden shed, right?

29:40 - Chris Andrade
This is the unique identifier. Yep. This is, it's a 10 by 16 garden shed, right? So it's very easy. Like, like, there's only a certain amount of these that we can generate to plug in or like at the, or at if, if there Be like, oh, I have this that's logged in their inventory. They can just go copy paste into slot one for that dealer for hyperlink or however it works. I don't know. And then the pictures and stuff will obviously need to be allocated.

30:19 - Trent Christopher
How does, I mean, you were kind of showing us a little bit, but how does the mapping process go? Shed one equals this serial number. Where's that kept? So that is on their, is that on the website? Is that Excel spreadsheet? It's Excel spreadsheet.

30:41 - Chris Andrade
Yeah.

30:42 - Trent Christopher
Okay. Yeah. It's on their Excel spreadsheet.

30:47 - Chris Andrade
Yeah. I figured that's where it was. That's where the world runs out of Excel.

30:51 - Trent Christopher
So. Yeah. And this is why it's like, it makes it good for us though, right?

30:57 - Chris Andrade
Yeah. Because that's how everything is for them. So then it just kind of makes it easier for us to go and find it at the end of the day. Sure, sure. Yeah, we can hook right into that.

31:11 - Trent Christopher
The good thing about Excel is that you can build structure and you can make it whatever you want, pretty much. The bad thing about Excel is that you can make it whatever you want and people break it all the time. So the idea would be to migrate away from Excel, but meet where they are now to try to integrate what they have now to minimize the impact of implementing a system. Right? Right.

31:41 - Chris Andrade
And so the MVP guys, in all reality, yes, that would be optimum. And then what's cool about that is that we would be able to instantly quantify the amount of productivity that we were able to produce just by implementing that. Right? So. it. Small variable.

32:01 - Trent Christopher
Because we could measure how many more people were coming. Well, we don't have a baseline, though, do we? No, we do, though.

32:08 - Chris Andrade
We do. Right. If we're able to if we are able to kind of go because we have three years or two years worth of historical sales. Right. That we reference off of and if we're above average. Right. I mean, right now. Do you have accounts?

32:30 - Trent Christopher
Do you have any estimate or account of how many people show up and don't buy a current way to calculate the close versus sale rate?

32:40 - Chris Andrade
Yeah. No.

32:42 - Trent Christopher
Yeah. So, yeah, that's what I was thinking about. I didn't think you guys did. just thought I'd ask. That's what I'm trying to get them to do.

32:49 - Chris Andrade
Right. Because then we can actually be able to quantify what our ad spend budget can be. Right.

32:57 - Trent Christopher
Is there a one way in one way out? right. I hope. Do a situation at the dealership? If somebody's going to come visit, is there a one-way in, one-way out, like a driveway?

33:07 - Chris Andrade
Yep, there's only one. That's why, literally, I was always thinking about if I can stick a lot of tenant with the hyperlink and as soon as it sees a car pulling in, it's on its little Segway. Like, pull up to your front door and be like, hey, welcome to You're like a humanoid robot. It's legit. Like, be able to give them that hyperlink in their face, right? And be like, hey, scam me, scam me promotional. And look at, oh, you know, like, legit, that's what I was thinking. Like, we can eventually, we'll be able to offer. But then the best part about something like that is, is that then it turns into the nighttime security guard. Because that's ultimately another issue that all these dealerships have. Is that if somebody can break into the lot and that... So they have to take, because the keys always stay inside the building. Well, when you're in Paducah, Kentucky, and you got no, you know, the citizens don't, you know, walk around the corners in Paducah, Kentucky, like they do here on 39th Avenue and McDowell, people tend to sleep home in these buildings, right? So now they have to take the keys out, and it turns into, you know what I mean? Like, there's another opportunity there, you know? So what else?

34:35 - Trent Christopher
Like, if you say, well, the hyperlinks are in your mind one of the highest impact items you can have, what would be the next thing or what would be another priority?

34:45 - Chris Andrade
The customer ability to give a customer a portfolio for the dealer to reference about their spending. Because out of five customers, let's just say three of them return. One, two, three, we've had one guy who's buying like 15 buildings from us, dude, right? Yeah. I there's no way to keep track of those types of guys, right? So what I was thinking is that if we had a way to have a customer portfolio, then remember those maps and details that the customer gives about, then the second one is to connect that portfolio to the driver. then as the, as the dealer or, you know, the, the customer has access to their portfolio. So when they get that call the night before, Hey, I'm going to come in here with your building, like, Oh, cool. Hey, my dealer gave me this link, text it to the driver. Now the driver gets all the maps, all the details. They know how , if I load the building on this way, then I can just back up to the thing. And I, I don't have to unload the building and put it on wheels. And I just save you 45 minutes. Let me load up the building. Thanks dealer. Like that is valuable. Right. And that would, that would be what is going to catch Graceland's ears. So now I think the dealer to the customer and the customer to the driver. Yeah.

36:19 - Trent Christopher
So how is this, other than tracking and trying to mitigate issues, how is this making more money? Is it because we're able to now measure the metrics and now you know what to improve? Or do you believe that just implementing these things is going to bring in more revenue? Yeah.

36:45 - Chris Andrade
So what my thought here is that because of the leads and the quality of leads, like guys, I got guys who want shipping containers modified and like freaking Like the opportunity that comes through these gates for upsell for like myself with the GC license is truly like this is like a lot of missed opportunities for as a GC, right? And so me as a GC see value in aligning with somebody with these dealerships or having the ability to be like, hey, you guys keep sending me work, like maybe I should pay you a fee to keep referring me work, like it makes sense, right? And so my thought is we are turning that dealer and giving them like another version of an Angie's List, right?

37:47 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Like people who people who show up to the lot are people who need contracting work done. So we're kind of like just anticipating their needs with this idea and just being like weak. can also connect you if you need, like, these other services, right?

38:04 - Chris Andrade
Yeah. Oh, you need a concrete pad board? Oh, yeah, yeah. Let me get Remus Development over here. Oh, you need a septic system going? Oh, yeah, I got EUS Underground.

38:13 - Trent Christopher
What would be, so you could, sure, you could provide a contact list, right? But when you go to, like, for example, you go to Lowe's and you want them to install a floor. I don't think Lowe's actually has, you know, they don't have their own installation crew. They have people that they partner with, right? That do, like, contractors, right? So, you know, these...

38:40 - Chris Andrade
think the value of that, though, and I get what you're saying, but what you're doing is you're getting them to come to you to get that done, right? Going back to the dealer, because eventually, well, I'm going to need to have that container or that water bin or that greenhouse or...

39:01 - Trent Christopher
So what you're saying is that the Lowe's approach, it means they're just going to continue to go back to Lowe's, but they're not going to go to the contractor that can do more than what Lowe's can do, right?

39:12 - Chris Andrade
Yeah, and then using our interface to make that connection, and then for us, it gives us ad spend or clicks.

39:21 - Trent Christopher
Even if you're passing off the responsibility from S&S to Remus to pour the concrete, right? If you can streamline that in a way that like, okay, you know what size the building is, you know when it's going to be delivered, you know all of those things, and you can sort of hand off those details and all that, you know, Remus has to do is follow up and say, hey, look, we're going to show up and we're going to start pouring your concrete on X date. Right? And we'll take care of everything for you.

39:51 - Mekaiel Abdullahi
Right?

39:52 - Chris Andrade
And that's what I mean by bringing a whole other level of customer service and anticipation, because guys, this isn't This isn't like a 15,000 like some of these projects are in the hundreds of thousands of dollars right 50,000 we like like for one big one client bought four buildings that cost 30 grand a pop and put them on there and then he had cranes that had to get out there and then yeah septics and concrete and fencing somebody had to go build a road clear the trees. And the problem is is that the they they source these Craigslist or Facebook guys and then they get robbed and then again it goes back to the dealer the dealer you guys been here for 30 years how come you don't know anybody that can help me out like come on and that's ultimately what I'm trying to get out of that like it's an easy win for the dealer and it's easy for us because we are Weaving out the crooked guys And taking over this industry and construction in general. Yeah.

41:05 - Trent Christopher
I was thinking it would be interesting to know when I was asking that question earlier about do you have any idea how many people drive in but never buy? I was thinking it'd be interesting if you could count the people that come in or count the vehicles that pass into your lot.

41:21 - Chris Andrade
That's in there to have like because I know you there's the tracking like that we can put like imagine if we just had a we need a camera to monitor our security anyways, who's to say that camera can track how many cars go in and out and count how many people how many how long did the cars stay here like get using that AI tracker that the coffee shop guy put into his baristas to see which barista was more efficient than the other ones and literally tracked where they went and how they went. was like damn.

41:57 - Trent Christopher
They do that they do that in. I don't know if it was Chick-fil-A, or there was a, maybe McDonald's or something, there was a whole evaluation where they put cameras up right there and they were actually paying attention to how everybody was moving in there to try to make it more efficient. So I'm guessing it was Chick-fil-A, because Chick-fil-A can freaking crank it out. Holy bro, I've never had to be in 10 minutes, not even.

42:21 - Mekaiel Abdullahi
Oh man, it's like, I swear they have it ready.

42:24 - Trent Christopher
They have your order ready, like when you pull up to the window. I swear they do. But yeah, so, I mean, I love all the ideas. So, I mean, building out a system like this is definitely something that would be.

42:41 - Chris Andrade
The coolest part is that we have all the data we need, we have the end user, we have the user, we have the information that how they get the billing, what use, how, like everything we need to anticipate grace plans. Requirements. Requirements. And how to provide them some really good without even having a conversation with them. So when that conversation is ready, we are just ready to just have that presentation on cue, you know, at the end of the day, though, it's like, the possibilities of what can be done just to, like, capitalize on market, like, I even include our marketing research into the source of truth to reference just the volume of growth that is this, this market is about to hit in, but the next 10 years, why is it growing again?

43:46 - Trent Christopher
Like, what's the purpose? Like, why?

43:50 - Chris Andrade
Because the cost of living is so high. So Phoenix in Arizona, just passed a law that you can, you don't have, like, They just bypassed a bunch of the, um, ordinance and the, um, so you couldn't just put a grandmother's unit in any backyard, right? The permitting process, the dwelling unit, like all that, they eliminated all that. Okay. So now reduce the restrictions on housing and development and like, it's still expensive. So, so people need places to put things. Right. Right. More space for things.

44:33 - Trent Christopher
you're, you're the projection is that because people need more space, they're going to add it on in other ways. Instead of upgrading to a new home, they're going to add it on by throwing it in their backyard or off to the side or whatever they do. Right.

44:47 - Chris Andrade
So, and then, and that's just in portable building guys, the, the, the green, the researching greenhouses, right. And, and, and shipping containers, the home conversions and shipping containers. there's, This is what's cool is that like you guys doing stuff with that? What's that?

45:05 - Trent Christopher
Are you guys doing stuff with that like where they're doing the where they call those the container homes?

45:09 - Chris Andrade
Yeah, so I just got Archie Fab who is waiting to meet you guys. He is I don't. He's a huge level up for Remus or for SNS now because he can do the conceptual. He can do the vertical, the architectural. And send off the permitting for the client and completely handle the whole turn. It's a whole turnkey solution. Anything metal for us from now on. And dude, he can, he can build anything. And now I don't even have to worry about the what the possibilities are for shipping containers. This is why I'm trying to build this platform because if we can instill the trust in the client. We clients that are coming in through these doors as much as possible. Then when they see the backup of what we have by the contractors to support them after the purchase, not just getting to the purchase, but the support that goes after is what's going to speak volumes to the potential opportunity that we can provide, but then give the dealer the support that gives them the them the ultimate leg up in their own markets to say, Hey, this is what we do to give to you to make sure that our customers are taken care of. Right? So I just had an idea.

46:44 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
I'm sure you've had several ideas like this, but I was just thinking like a vision of kind of how the whole app idea could work is like, imagine someone rolls up on the lot and you have a person, a lot attendant person. sure a partner. uh. You know, someday maybe a robot, but like a person just tell them like, hey, if you sign up with this app, you can get 10% off your first shed, right? Then they download the app, they get the app, and then they log in so that you have their email. And then it's like, as they're driving to go park, like, then they can select like, what else do you need after, once you get your shed? Like, what do you need? Like, do you need this?

47:34 - Chris Andrade
Yeah, you're talking e-commerce stuff, right? Where like, Amazon always has the add-ons.

47:39 - Trent Christopher
They want to say, oh, what else goes with that? You need this too. And you need this, you need this too. Or like Best Buy says, oh, well, you need a surge protector for your TV, right? So that kind of thing.

47:50 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
It's like the money models, like literally, in the beginning of money models, it's like, when in the storage unit example, they're like, it's like, Like, oh, you need boxes, right?

48:05 - Chris Andrade
You need a lock. The first one needs a lock, right? Some people need movers. Some people, everyone, pretty much everyone needs boxes. Right?

48:13 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
And it's just like, yeah, the present fits of what I'm trying to do.

48:21 - Chris Andrade
What we're like, yes, we're trying to give them the locks, the box, the tape, the saran wrap, like all of those things. And that's because there's no one out there that's doing it. And so these customers who are literally trying to spend thousands of dollars, right, has no support system to leverage that missed opportunity to spend that money, dude. Like straight up.

48:51 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
It's like, could I really do this? Like I'm, I'm at the shed lot. I think I want one, but like, can I really do this? And then you have your app just showing. And then like, you can do this. We can do this for you. can do this for you. Just eliminating objections.

49:04 - Trent Christopher
Eliminate.

49:05 - Chris Andrade
So real quick, just while you test out of that is that, Matt, I have created in that source of truth, there is a section in there that gives some questions, like a way to, like part of it is like, hey, answer these five questions and you get a hundred dollars off your order or $50 off. that's what, with my mom, what they just said is that now Graceland is giving them those incentives, right? So now, hey, if you give us, answer these seven questions, you get $50 off. And then in these workbooks, there's really engineered questions to ultimately answer what kind of customer is this coming through here, right? And then, and then like, because they're answering these questions, dude, the man of The knowledge that the dealer gets from that customer for marketing, for ad spend, for how much inventory can it bring in, like, should I buy more containers or bring more greenhouses, like, it gives the dealer so much more power because then they're able to spend their money to buy inventory that doesn't sit on the lot, right? And now they're turning inventory faster because now they have these engineered questions that cater to, like, what kind of customers to sell for, what kind of ads to be pushing, you know? That's kind of what I'm, like, trying to scratch here is, like, dudes, like, the possibilities are kind of endless. And I'm trying to stay focused and just stick to the CRM because I can go crazy, dude. Come in. And come come in.

51:00 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
And even if they like, if they fill that out on the way in, and we can process it quickly, we could send that to the lot attendant and have them go talk to the client.

51:15 - Mekaiel Abdullahi
They could have an instantaneous response.

51:17 - Trent Christopher
I mean, there's, there's no reason in today's world that if they have internet access, there's no reason. There's no reason that they can't get an instantaneous notification somehow, an email, a text message. You know, maybe it's an actual system that gives them like, you know, push notifications, whatever it is, right? There is ways to do that. So then they could also, if they know the email or other things about the prospect, they could know a little bit more about them. You could go to somewhere else, get some information about that person, and then give them more information if it's useful, but maybe it's not useful in this case. So, but yeah, and then they could go out there and talk to them.

52:03 - Mekaiel Abdullahi
My question would be like, how would that look if it is an app that we choose to do? How would that look for internal versus like external? okay, so like, between a lot of tenant and like the system that they're using internally to communicate that real time data, like, how would that look like? Or like, what would they work out of? Like, would it be the app itself? Or what would it be?

52:29 - Trent Christopher
In the very beginning, if we're going to be just like scaffolding a couple pieces on the outside, or like, just tacking these new features on the outside of what they currently do for now, just to get it going. You know, we would just tie into whatever they currently have. So they can continue doing what they're doing, right? Whether it be on the website or an Excel spreadsheet, we would probably need to make the Excel spreadsheet something that is online if they're not doing that currently. It would need to be in Microsoft. It But otherwise, as long as it doesn't have macros, you can do that. If it has macros, you can't. But if it's just, I think as long as it's just a formula.

53:11 - Chris Andrade
function. Yeah. External spreadsheets?
ACTION ITEM: Ask Matthew re: SNS Excel external refs/macros; then migrate to online Excel/Sheets if needed - WATCH: https://fathom.video/share/DB8EPPNDUmnRMsex7xSZCoaeAq5kCXXw?timestamp=3197.9999

53:18 - Trent Christopher
Excuse me? When they're Excel spreadsheets that they typically use, are they referencing external spreadsheets? Or is it everything inside that one?

53:28 - Chris Andrade
Well, let's just chalk that up in our note taker to ask Matthew about that, because I'd be curious myself. To be honest, I don't know. I would like to see how he does that. But I think, to answer your question, Mekaiel, is what I initially, how I would see that. And this is something that I put a lot of thought into over the week, after realizing what opportunities we got. Because, to be honest, we have two. . So that we can kind of pursue with this. We got one avenue which I talked to you about going straight to Graceland. We got another avenue is by building out what we're doing as MVP just to get us what we need and then put SNS on the roadmap, right, as like the pinnacle, like the pioneers of this new methodology, right? Then my thought is because there's a lot of division in these dealerships because what happens is that sometimes there can be a phone call out here in, let's just say, Courtside, Arizona, right? But that dealer in Courtside is trying to sell a building in Flagstaff, Arizona, right? Yeah. And or they try to push ads outside of their bubble, right? And now they're infringing on another dealer in their area, right? So because there's a 50 mile radius of rule that Graceland can't, there's not another dealer that can open up within 50 miles, right? Well, what we found is that they're in Arizona, there's about six key players, right? I know all of these key players very well. And my second thought, which I talked to my mom about, and she thinks it's a good idea is we build this out, leverage the system to force Graceland to kind of adhere to, because what happens in Arizona is very unique to Arizona and Arizona only because of the terrain, right? Because the ground's so hard. Nowhere else in Missouri, I guess in New Mexico, so Arizona and New Mexico are kind of similar, but everywhere else, the ground is soft. It's just Arizona and New Mexico are unique to all the other ones. Graceland has to spend a whole lot of extra money to cater to Arizona and New Mexico. So the dealers also have a unique perspective of the problems that come just from being selling dealers or sheds here that other dealers don't have to deal with, right? And because Graceland doesn't give that special attention to these dealers. They kind of are forced to like, like they have no choice, right? Well, this would give them some leverage to make some solid requests in the company. And then once they see the support system, then they're going to be like, yeah, this is why we're doing so good. And then that's how we would be introduced to Graceland.

57:27 - Trent Christopher
Okay, so I can tell you spent a lot of time thinking about it.

57:34 - Chris Andrade
Obviously, this is like your life.

57:37 - Trent Christopher
And you got ideas in this workbook, and we're going to take us a little while probably like, dude, this is four years worth of work into this one document.

57:47 - Chris Andrade
I get it. I get it.

57:49 - Trent Christopher
Like, so So, um, what do you have in mind for the path forward? out. take Ok, We're So, let's you.

58:00 - Chris Andrade
I think what we discussed about how I think what I think the MVP is, and then at the end of the day, it's for you guys to kind of see if I'm like in an alignment with you guys. Identify MVP. Got it. And use what we have here with what we just got from our discovery call. And then let's find an alignment, and then let's kind of see how this looks moving forward. And then if we can come up with some sort of MVP to offer for our, you know, our initiation, right, of what, you know, with the Arise Group, then we can get that onboarded by Friday if we want. But at the end of the day, it's like, how does that look? I mean, that's a lot of internal discussion. So I know, Trent, you're going to be busy. It's already, , it's almost 10 o'clock for you right now. Have So, I mean, yeah. So, tomorrow morning, I told my wife, was like, look, love, I love you. But I got to get back to work here because we got a lot to do. So, tomorrow morning at 6am, I will be right here ready to get right back in it. And so, I'll be available, yeah, to meet with you guys and to really start going through all of the, I'll be going through that tonight too, to go get caught up on the Slack channel and then start getting everything lined up for this week. And then, you guys want to wrap up tomorrow morning, and then Trent, we can kind of just fill you in afterwards. I can meet with you afterwards, if you like. But yeah. We can listen to or see a summary of the transcript or something.

59:57 - Trent Christopher
That's fine too.

59:58 - Chris Andrade
So, I can listen to that.

1:00:00 - Trent Christopher
Maybe while I'm, you know, doing some work, like after you guys are done, if I see it pops through, whatever it is, I I can throw my headphones in and be doing something on the side. So I don't, I don't know how to skin this cat guys.

1:00:12 - Chris Andrade
And I don't know how, like, I don't like, this is one of the concerns I had, but every single thought that is in here and how I think it could work is in that document. That's 300 pages long. And I'm really sorry. But like, Matthew, like we talked about, remember when I was saying, like, as I built out this, like what I know would make it work, I was saving each PDF in a Word document, and it just kept building, kept building, and even the whole transcript itself on how this thing was built is in here.

1:00:53 - Trent Christopher
So, yeah, perfect.

1:00:58 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
I was saying it's perfect, because it's a lot of. I think that the more context we have, the AI is going to be processing it. We're going to be looking at it, too, of course, but like... We don't have to strategically...

1:01:14 - Trent Christopher
I don't think a 300-page document just dumping it in and saying, hey, what do you think is really going to be the approach here?

1:01:23 - Chris Andrade
I do have everything separated, too. And I think I gave you guys that folder as well.

1:01:30 - Trent Christopher
But even separate takes pieces out of context, right? So I'm kind of wondering how we can break it into pieces. If there's a way that we can get the AI to actually go through and sample it. I don't know. I don't know if you can put a 300-page document in there and expect the AI to be able to... Well, what if I eliminated...

1:01:55 - Chris Andrade
I don't know. Tell me how I can make this... Yeah, pre-processing, if we could figure out a way where you could do that.

1:02:10 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
That's what I'm trying to figure out is how do we pre-process this.

1:02:13 - Trent Christopher
There's probably information that's in here that is about the planning, and then there's details about implementation. Right? So I'm not saying that we should remove the context, but I'm trying to figure out is there a way to separate those two. Separate something. It doesn't have be those two, but like maybe it's not necessary to have the full context in the beginning, but then it will for implementation.

1:02:44 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
So you can you can basically like create embeddings and you can sort of search documents like by category or by topic. Similarity?

1:02:59 - Trent Christopher
Yeah.

1:03:01 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Yeah, like, it's sort of like how RAG search works, right? So you could search for particular things if we have specific questions, semantic similarity.

1:03:15 - Mekaiel Abdullahi
Yep.

1:03:19 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
In theory, so we could try that. See how it goes.

1:03:22 - Trent Christopher
So Google has a file search tool that might be very quick for us to be able to do something with it. I don't know if we can just upload it with Claude and just see what it does. I don't know. It's maybe it's a worth a shot. I just feel like it's going to be a big swallow for it. Yeah, I was thinking.

1:03:40 - Mekaiel Abdullahi
I could be underestimating it though.

1:03:42 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Yeah, I mean, they have like Google Drive integration now with these things. So like, I was thinking we just connect it. And then we ask it like, hey, this is a pretty big database. This is pretty big. This is a lot of context. Like, what do you think we should do and see what it says? Yeah.

1:04:00 - Trent Christopher
think that actually that's probably going to be the first approach really is to take this document and don't even like, maybe don't even put it in anything yet. Just have a chat with Claude or Gemini or whoever and say, Hey, look, we have this document has a bunch of information and it's all important for what we're trying to do. But how do we break it into pieces that AI can process it with without losing context?

1:04:26 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Yeah. When you say document, is it, is it one document? Are you talking about the whole folder? That's true.

1:04:34 - Trent Christopher
More things than just this single PDF. No, no.

1:04:38 - Chris Andrade
So every single thing in those folders are in that source of true document. Got it.

1:04:44 - Trent Christopher
It's broken into pieces inside the folder. This is, this is concatenated.

1:04:49 - Chris Andrade
This is a pen, right? Everything's appended to the end of it.

1:04:52 - Trent Christopher
Got it.

1:04:55 - Chris Andrade
Exactly. Everything, all of these documents, everything is in this. This SOT folder is all in that one V1 SOT keys to the castle. Yeah. Like my original thought process is why I did that. And I now on the hindsight, probably wrong, but I figure it could be used as our reference for when we need the question of what's the thought process here. I thought that's how it could work. Yeah, it might be perfect.

1:05:29 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Like we might just be able to ask it like, Hey, can you look at all the headings and give us an overview? And then we can just from the headings, can see like, where do we start? Yes.

1:05:41 - Chris Andrade
That's why I think I broke it down. I think that's when Trent, think I asked you about how I should try to approach something like this. And I just, I went through and gave the first page a heading of all the page numbers of what is where. Yep. Yep. Yep. reference the chat too. through here. Mm-hmm. And use that as a guide to like, hey, from here to here, this is just how this was the conversation from, I don't know, you know what I mean? So that's my why I like that.

1:06:13 - Trent Christopher
Yeah, an index, right? Something that points the AI or a human to where to go to for that particular thing. Yeah, yeah.

1:06:21 - Chris Andrade
And so that's on the page. And I figure if it had that, then it has some sort of reference to kind of go through all like it gives this PDF, this giant PDF, some sort of context that hopefully could be referenced in one way, shape or form. Yep. I'm with you. I'm with you. Yeah.

1:06:43 - Trent Christopher
So there's some interesting challenges here for sure. But, um, I, I think that we should definitely take it all on and because it's challenges that we need to overcome and, and I don't, I don't foresee this being unique down the road.

1:06:59 - Chris Andrade
Like I freak I could definitely foresee somebody like, hey, man, I had this great conversation with AI, and yeah, I think I want to tune this to that. How much is it going to cost?

1:07:11 - Trent Christopher
Yeah, a lot of the stuff that you have in here is applicable across many industries. Cool. Well, at least, cool.

1:07:19 - Chris Andrade
Awesome, man. And yeah, so I'll be up in Adams tomorrow morning available. I'll be locked in here with coffee and music and just going through, getting ready for how many people we got. Like, if we can get maybe another two or three onboarding calls done next week, I think that would be pretty cool.
ACTION ITEM: Schedule 6am Dec 29 sync w/ Matthew, Mekaiel re: priorities/MVP - WATCH: https://fathom.video/share/DB8EPPNDUmnRMsex7xSZCoaeAq5kCXXw?timestamp=4059.9999 Or discovery calls next week. That would be pretty cool. I think that's my goal. If we can get another two or three in the books, that'd be fun. That'd be good. And then tomorrow morning, Chris, to just go over, like, like, priorities this week.

1:07:57 - Mekaiel Abdullahi
And obviously, Plotter is one of our P0s. And just how we can attack that. also, like, just streamline process to like, I worked on intake form agent and like some just context building, like ways to build context on like the people you're talking to, and stuff so that that stuff can feed into our processes and maps and structure. And yeah, we can we can set time for that tomorrow morning, first thing. Just so yeah, Matthew, Matthew as well.

1:08:26 - Chris Andrade
So we can all just get aligned and then go break off, do whatever we're Yeah, so I got initiated Fireflies to transfer my Remus account to my PolyG account. So that's going to be huge. And then from there, my recording system will be pretty dope to be implemented to my clod eventually, right?
ACTION ITEM: Set up shared client intake/pre-call file structure in OS for Chris - WATCH: https://fathom.video/share/DB8EPPNDUmnRMsex7xSZCoaeAq5kCXXw?timestamp=4129.9999 So my thought is so.

1:09:00 - Mekaiel Abdullahi
That could maybe even just be on your cloud yourself. I can help you with the file structure. Just whoever you're contacting or planning to set up a call with, maybe a link on their website. Just some of the client intake stuff and just the pre-stuff to build context.

1:09:19 - Chris Andrade
Yeah, so you're saying as I'm onboarding, you guys are getting their website, their information, the context of who we're talking about. So then as you save on your OS and then I can just pull it down if you share it. Yeah, so I'm kind of excited about these phone calls this week. It's going to be some cool happening.

1:09:48 - Mekaiel Abdullahi
And yeah, I think also another, I think I thought of, what if we all sync up our calendaries, create a new calendar there, sync up our calendaries, and it's just a. Would able to see availability and stuff like that? Or would that work, Yeah, I highly agree.

1:10:06 - Chris Andrade
I agree that we should figure out how to do that.

1:10:09 - Trent Christopher
I am not clear at the moment on how it works. I mean, some of us are using Calendly and we paid for a membership or something. We're paying for a membership and we're on separate accounts. So I don't know how that works to link all of them together when they're not part of the same organization or team. I'm not paying for Calendly.

1:10:32 - Chris Andrade
Are you guys paying for Calendly? I don't think I am.

1:10:38 - Mekaiel Abdullahi
I think be on a free plan. I'm not sure. So free plan is fine for doing just the basics.

1:10:48 - Trent Christopher
But if you need to do like intake forms or you want to integrate it with other things or you want to create specific meeting types. So... So...

1:11:03 - Chris Andrade
And Trent, is it an option for us to tag on to you and then we just like pay you for it versus having, like, is that an option at all? It might be.

1:11:14 - Trent Christopher
I don't know. Let me see what I got.

1:11:18 - Chris Andrade
Let me see.

1:11:24 - Trent Christopher
I got the free plan.

1:11:26 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Holy . Enterprise is 15k per year. What does that even mean?

1:11:32 - Mekaiel Abdullahi
15k?

1:11:34 - Chris Andrade
15k? Yeah. No.

1:11:37 - Trent Christopher
What are you looking at? Would you smoke something before you got on here? Give me some, bro.

1:11:45 - Mekaiel Abdullahi
I'll show you guys a screenshot.

1:11:48 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
What in the world?

1:11:49 - Trent Christopher
I don't know what you're looking at, man.

1:11:51 - Mekaiel Abdullahi
He is in California. Yeah, maybe they got a California premium on it.

1:12:00 - Chris Andrade
I'm on the standard plan.

1:12:02 - Trent Christopher
Oh, yeah, the enterprise starts at 15k. Goodness. Oh, yeah. He says, oh, .

1:12:07 - Chris Andrade
He's right. I don't understand it. I don't know.

1:12:11 - Trent Christopher
What is so wonderful they have to charge $15,000 a year for?

1:12:18 - Chris Andrade
It's probably like you can give a thousand employees access or something.

1:12:22 - Trent Christopher
That's probably what it is. You get like, I'm looking to like, I don't see anything that tells you specifically.

1:12:31 - Chris Andrade
Hey, guys, give me a minute. I'm going to go say goodnight to the girls. Yeah, do it.

1:12:36 - Trent Christopher
All right. Yep. So I'm on the standard is 12 bucks a month, but I don't know how it works with business teams. So it says collaborate effectively team members drive business results with smart automations reporting. Oh, says $20 a month. Why does it say? Oh, that's team. I'm on the standard, but Teams is $20 per seat, which is like kind of a ripoff, but I'm wondering if we need to potentially not use Calendly, but let me just think on this for a second.
ACTION ITEM: Research Calendly sync options; propose solution to Chris, Matthew, Mekaiel - WATCH: https://fathom.video/share/DB8EPPNDUmnRMsex7xSZCoaeAq5kCXXw?timestamp=4387.9999 I got to figure out whether or not we can just synchronize our Calendly by just maybe asking Claude to see what it says. There's also another, there's an open source alternative that we could host ourselves, potentially. That works too. Yeah, so that might be a possibility. Like all these services, right? They just like continuously just don't want to nickel and dime you to death. It adds up though.

1:13:47 - Mekaiel Abdullahi
It adds up.

1:13:48 - Trent Christopher
But you know, I've been like signing up for these things in anticipation because I'm going to make some money and I have to have these tools so that I can make the money, right?

1:13:57 - Mekaiel Abdullahi
That's why I got it too.

1:13:59 - Trent Christopher
Yeah, I know. So it's like, oh man, but at the same time, you know, you have to make sure you're bringing in the money to pay for it. So, let's see, what's to say?

1:14:15 - Mekaiel Abdullahi
How about Cal.com?

1:14:19 - Trent Christopher
Yeah, that might be the one that I was thinking of, that you can host your open source as well. Like, they have their own online service, like, just like Calendly, but I think you can also host your own.

1:14:44 - Mekaiel Abdullahi
Well, the free plan lets you take payments via Stripe. That's pretty cool. You guys, can I show you guys something?

1:14:53 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Yeah. Yeah. All right. right. So I just use bolt.new

1:15:01 - Mekaiel Abdullahi
Yeah.

1:15:02 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
So I used it to, I just said, here's the SNS Wolfshed website. Can you, I think I said, like, can you create like an onboarding flow? So this is my prompt, ask for contact information. So there's, it did this in like one shot. So it has like our products, all this stuff, 10% off today, special offer, good 10% off, start application. We'll find the perfect shed for your needs. This will only take a few minutes. Start application, email address, phone number. And then it asks this, what type of building you're looking for?
ACTION ITEM: Re-run SNS onboarding flow in AI Studio; share results w/ Trent, Mekaiel - WATCH: https://fathom.video/share/DB8EPPNDUmnRMsex7xSZCoaeAq5kCXXw?timestamp=4541.9999

1:15:42 - Chris Andrade
Done. Done.

1:15:44 - Trent Christopher
Send them a bill. Crazy.

1:15:49 - Chris Andrade
Free plan. ran out of tokens.

1:15:52 - Mekaiel Abdullahi
Awesome.

1:15:52 - Trent Christopher
Hey, so can you do the same thing? Like, can you do the same prompt? Go over to AI Studio. see you next video. and do it there. I want to see the difference between the two.

1:16:03 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Okay. I think AI Studio might do it better.

1:16:06 - Trent Christopher
That's kind of what I've been thinking. AI Studio, I mean- That's what I noticed.

1:16:11 - Mekaiel Abdullahi
I'm almost like, why am I using Lovable Pro? Would you guys use Pro Preview, Repro Preview?

1:16:18 - Trent Christopher
You know, earlier today I was trying to use Pro Preview, but the default is Flash. So I don't know. Okay.

1:16:25 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Just pick one and go for it, I guess.

1:16:27 - Trent Christopher
Yeah. Pro is supposed to be the better. is AI Studio?

1:16:33 - Chris Andrade
It's Google's Bolt.

1:16:35 - Mekaiel Abdullahi
can think about that. It's or Lovable.

1:16:38 - Trent Christopher
It's Bolt or Lovable from Google's, and it's free right now.

1:16:41 - Chris Andrade
What is Bolt? That's crazy amount for that. already know.

1:16:44 - Mekaiel Abdullahi
Okay.

1:16:45 - Trent Christopher
So Chris hasn't been through the gambit of material in the accelerator yet. So are you familiar with Lovable?

1:16:54 - Chris Andrade
So yeah, that's like another version of Claude, right? No, not really. So what did actually-

1:17:00 - Trent Christopher
Well, kind of. Okay, so when I say kind of, it is designed for building web apps. So you have a chat with it, and you tell it what you want for a website or a web app, and it'll build it for you. Okay, Bolt.new does the same thing, except for Bolt.new does it like in their own way, they have their extra little features and stuff. And the differentiator between Lovable and Bolt.new was that Lovable was mostly UI and didn't really do the back end, like database. And other services behind it to make it function. Bolt.new had figured out how to do the back end stuff too. So bolt.new is a little better that way. However, it circled back around and Lovable caught on to it and said, Oh, we need to have it too. So they both have similar functionality. Yeah.

1:17:55 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
So this is the website that I'm, I'm, I'm, client who paid me a thousand. So far is is paying me to create like a chat interface on the lovable website. So I've hooked up to the database and everything. And I'm doing like sort of like a rag. I was working on this last night. So we can now upload documents. And then the chat can reference the document to answer information about it. And there's this knowledge document thing. I'm just showing you this because this one's still running. So but this is lovable right now on the background right now with Chris.

1:18:38 - Trent Christopher
So he's using lovable to help one of his clients to build this website. Yep.

1:18:46 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Yeah.

1:18:46 - Trent Christopher
And this website has an AI chat bot on it with knowledge base.

1:18:53 - Chris Andrade
Yeah, that's something that I've been wanting to talk to you guys about too. And I think you touched on it a little a little while. Last night Trent about how we plan on moving forward and like obviously we put a lot of work into our own brands and I think our own brands have that special connection to who we are as individuals right and I was thinking about that and I think for us I feel like it's a hell of an opportunity to leverage what we do as our day to day individuals. Use that as our catalyst to our social media presence because again I hate social media, right? But if I'm talking about something that I'm passionate about about what I do every day, right? Oh, damn. Go ahead. Does it work? Let's see.

1:19:49 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
see. 10% off.

1:19:56 - Trent Christopher
I mean, some of it's a little hard to read, right? Yeah. We can fix that through some Vibes.

1:20:02 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Yeah, it's like single prompt if you do the right prompt. General storage. Mentions. I mean, these aren't the best questions, probably, but, you know, find my shed.

1:20:18 - Chris Andrade
Hey, Matthew, can you, when you're, oh, damn. The high barn.

1:20:27 - Trent Christopher
Schedule a consultation for this shed. Dude, that is fire, bro.

1:20:32 - Chris Andrade
Like, that is straight fire. Interesting. Can you open up a website, go to, um, or Google, uh, American Steel. Dot com? Yeah, it's, yeah. Hit dot com. Maybe it should be dot com. What's wrong? No, type, just Google search American Steel there. Uh, right there. Right there. Yeah, it's AmericanSteelInc.com Okay, so go to Build. Yeah, so that's the promotion we can run, actually. So, go Build and Price. Yeah, where's their builder? Yeah, click on Builder. They changed their own website. Yeah, okay. So, this is how we are generating our quotes right now. And we have our own version of this for SNS website. Just type 85226.

1:21:50 - Mekaiel Abdullahi
Like an embedded version or something in your website, right?

1:21:54 - Trent Christopher
Oh, no. So, we can push people to our...

1:22:07 - Chris Andrade
And so now Graceland has caught on to this recently, this platform. Apparently this platform like killed it. And whoever created it is raking it in. But yeah, so this is how our quotes are done. Right. And you can can even actually like, I think they incorporated like bringing your environment and like upload some pictures and . But so do this company, what's that view in your space?

1:22:46 - Trent Christopher
So yeah, exactly.

1:22:47 - Chris Andrade
Yeah. This is what I'm trying to get with our Graceland buildings. Like if I can get like something like this to say, Hey, does it sit here? It would solve so many problems, dude. The sales conversion rate just from that matrix alone would be insane, because the amount of times that I had to turn down a building from being delivered because it was improperly inspected, because there's no matrix to support if this building can get in here or not safely. And it goes back to the dealer by not providing enough support to sell a building that the customer ultimately couldn't buy. Yeah, you know, dude, this happens all the time. Like I'm like, no joke. Right. And that's what I might. So anyways, this thing doesn't work. By the way, on my phone, it doesn't work.

1:23:52 - Trent Christopher
So it's exciting to see in a QR code and the description, but it doesn't function. So. Mm. Mm. Well, so I love the flash, and I love the idea because it could solve some problems, but that has also got some, I want to say, relatively high technical challenges. And I'm not saying we need to build this or anything like that, because we don't need to, but this is like... Let's start with more basic lower-hanging fruit, right? Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1:24:25 - Chris Andrade
Like, so all these, so James now is building all these for us. Archiefab. So, yeah, it's a whole game changer. And that's why I'm trying to figure out how to market stuff. And I think that's why it might be an option for us to give an MVP to show them. Like, I don't know what we can do to build us, like, a way for them just to upload pictures and to take those pictures. To create these marketing materials that can be used for Facebook.

1:25:00 - Trent Christopher
Well, I mean, it's thousands of dollars to create, so have you seen the, there's, there are AI tools or services that you can pay for that what you can do is you have a product you want to sell, like an object, right? You have something you want to sell. You can take a picture of the object. And then what it'll do is it can actually put it into like, either an image or even a video of somebody new somebody using it or it doing a thing in a different place and creates all these images that you can use in your, in your material to sell it. Um, so I don't know if something like that might be interesting for a shed to be able to put it in different places.

1:25:44 - Chris Andrade
Um, it was so cool about like our, the, what we can do with our marketing is because of obviously just like the delivery side and the installation knowledge that we can provide. Right. Right. Most of these, most Steelers don't know what it takes to actually install a building because they've never seen an installation done, other than what's been shown on YouTube, you know, and that is what I'm trying to guess, what I'm trying to leverage on that front, but, I mean, So, yeah, so, yeah, we can probably build all these things, right?

1:26:34 - Trent Christopher
So, I think really kind of where we're at is parsing through the information to identify, we really need to do, you know, business function mapping and opportunity matrix to kind of really, and I think that it wouldn't be a bad idea to see if we can make an attempt on Calculating some ROI, but I don't know if we can get the numbers to be able to do that, but again, you, I mean, the reason

1:27:00 - Mekaiel Abdullahi
The I say that is that some of the metrics aren't measured right now, so it's good to know, it's good to know like the end goal and also like what, how things are currently being done and where things are right now to bridge those gaps. And then also just like definitely opportunity metrics, see what makes sense to the low hanging fruit, see how we can properly scope it out, you know? Yeah, I think there's a lot of opportunities that are going to be identified in the document.

1:27:27 - Trent Christopher
Right. And I think the first thing we're going to have to do is probably bubble the bubble, the good stuff to the top somehow. It's all good, but we need to somehow bubble the things that are going to bear the most fruit in the beginning and then put those on and put those on a opportunity matrix themselves. Like we'll have to do it in like groupings or phases or, you know, categories or, you know, I don't think we can, I guess.
ACTION ITEM: Grant Matthew website access; then fix image issues, add intake form, set up dynamic QR - WATCH: https://fathom.video/share/DB8EPPNDUmnRMsex7xSZCoaeAq5kCXXw?timestamp=5276.9999 you. Thank We could potentially put them all on an opportunity matrix and just have little bubbles with a number on them.

1:28:07 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Yeah, I'm thinking for quickest when, how soon can we start playing around with the website? I think that needs addressed. Yeah, because if we can just add a form, if we can fix up the issues, even before we add a form, just fix up the issue and just get the images all showing, that might just help a lot right away. And that would be very low effort on our part as long as, I mean, we just, we need to get connected to the website anyway. And then as soon as we have, if we can get a form like the one that I just, that we just saw up on there, then it's just like, I guess we had to figure out how the QR code on each barn works, but there's, mean, QR codes tying to a website is very easy. I've done that. ofieni8204 of

1:29:03 - Trent Christopher
So the trickiest part there is that more than likely just creating a simple QR code to a web address is quite literally it's just encoded in the QR. The web link is just encoded in the QR, right?

1:29:22 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
You can do dynamic ones, though.

1:29:25 - Mekaiel Abdullahi
You know what I mean?

1:29:29 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
So can have one QR code that has a dynamic link in the back end so you can change the link anytime you Yeah, I know what you're saying.

1:29:40 - Trent Christopher
like, was it like Bitly, right? Bitly has that and I use Dubb is what I currently use for myself because it was free and it gave me a lot of stuff. But yeah, and it has a little QR creator for that, too. Okay. But I don't know if that's That's the solution that we want for it, but because I don't think it's, I don't know if it's going to track the metrics that we need, but so.

1:30:10 - Chris Andrade
I have access to the website whenever you want, and I guess we'll just, can I ask you a question? If we work on the website and we see what happens, let's just say like down the road. Does another website like reiteration, can it, can it be built off of what we're talking about, excuse me, about iterating right now? Or is it how you think it might need to be a completely redone in the next iteration? Yeah, I see what you're saying.

1:30:49 - Trent Christopher
You're, you're wondering if the effort put towards fixing the current website is worth it. Correct. That's kind of your question, right? Because if we were going to. If a total revamp on the website, then maybe it's not worth it. But it would be more about filling in the time gap. If we have a plan for revamping the website with new features, it would be, that's great if we can just flip a switch and it has all the features, but it won't. It won't be immediate, right? So it's going to be the time span. So, right.

1:31:23 - Chris Andrade
And I think, I think personally, I think right now the website is functioning, has been working. I think we're losing opportunity every day by not capturing people that are coming in and out is my, my, honestly, is that's what I'm trying to capture. I, that is our biggest lost opportunity every day is by not capturing a wave of people's numbers, emails all in one.

1:32:00 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
So, but the easiest way that we're going to be able to set that up is through the website. Like, creating an Android app is going to take longer. Adding something to the existing website, which is a new path, will be the lowest paying fruit, I think, for helping with that.

1:32:17 - Chris Andrade
And then it makes sense, right? And then it makes sense to redo the website. And how does that look? Redo it or just add a web form?

1:32:29 - Trent Christopher
I think what Matthew's saying is that just fix a couple of the issues and put a web form on it right now so that you can get started doing what we're doing. Like, if we can just put those pieces in place using the existing website just to get started with your goal.

1:32:48 - Chris Andrade
Well, I like that.

1:32:50 - Trent Christopher
And then we're going to revamp, a total revamp. Right. That makes sense.

1:32:56 - Chris Andrade
That makes sense. And that's where I leave for you. Yeah, but now I just honestly I feel so relieved now that you guys got my workbook on your table and I know it's like a crazy rad test but there is some methodology to it. I promise. It's just a lot. Like I said, it's four years worth of skit that I got onto that one piece of applicable thing. So, yeah, yeah, it's a really good problem that we have.

1:33:38 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Yeah, usually the problem is not enough information.

1:33:46 - Trent Christopher
This one might be we have a little too much information up front. So it's actually a good problem like Matthew said.

1:33:54 - Chris Andrade
That's cool. Oh, that's cool. Awesome. Well, I tell you, Trent, I tell you. What time do you got to get back at it tomorrow morning?

1:34:02 - Trent Christopher
I'll be up probably at 6am, but I need to be in there at 7. So it'll be me knocking the crusties out of my eyes and drinking some coffee until about 7, about 630 probably. Okay.

1:34:17 - Chris Andrade
Well, I will be up in Adams that time, but two hours later. Yeah, I know.

1:34:26 - Trent Christopher
I'll plant.

1:34:28 - Chris Andrade
I'll already be in the factory. All right, dudes. Well, yeah, I'm going to get busy. We'll be here and let me know if you need anything. then, yeah, Mekaiel, Matt, I'll up tomorrow morning when you guys are up.

1:34:44 - Mekaiel Abdullahi
Yeah, I just wanted to really quick to show you, I feel like the easiest way, I don't know why I didn't think of this before, just hit me when Trent said, um, it's a hard way to like, look at everything. Oh, yeah, there you go. I just threw the document into . And then just did a mind map. But maybe just playing around with it here and seeing it laid out in a different way or in different forms.

1:35:11 - Trent Christopher
You took that whole document and dumped it in there? Yeah.

1:35:16 - Mekaiel Abdullahi
Wow.

1:35:17 - Trent Christopher
So a lot of these different services, like when you just want to put a file into it. I don't know how big the file is. How big is the megabytes? Like how many megabytes is it?

1:35:29 - Mekaiel Abdullahi
I got it right here.

1:35:30 - Chris Andrade
It's only 3.9.

1:35:32 - Trent Christopher
So it's not really that big from a file size perspective. But yes, right away it did it. Maybe I was thinking there's a problem when there isn't so. Hell yeah.

1:35:48 - Chris Andrade
Honestly, I was waiting for this. I wanted to see what this looked like. was like, I wonder what it would look like if they put it in their OS. And then now I get to see what they look like when they're around with it. Like that's it. Yeah, this was like that. This was...

1:36:00 - Trent Christopher
I mean, I think, is that free access or do you have to have like a Google Pay account? It's free. It's a free Google tool.

1:36:11 - Chris Andrade
Google is like on, bro.

1:36:12 - Mekaiel Abdullahi
Like Google's one of, like...

1:36:14 - Trent Christopher
Google's got one of the best all-around AI tool sets. Yeah.

1:36:20 - Chris Andrade
That's why Gemini...

1:36:23 - Mekaiel Abdullahi
They just brought some new tools, too. I think it's called like Opus something, but like a browser, like, they're doing a lot of stuff. Like, there's so many... What the show is Poppy AI?

1:36:36 - Chris Andrade
Poppy?

1:36:39 - Mekaiel Abdullahi
Yeah. Poppy AI?

1:36:41 - Trent Christopher
I think I saw that. Yeah. So Poppy AI. Okay. I know what that... I know what it is. It's coming back. So there is a whole section in the YouTube mastery for a section in the accelerator for Poppy. It talks about what Poppy is, is... It was... will help you either take your own videos or other people's videos and material and you can ideate, you can create content ideas from that and build out like your content that you, your content plan for like YouTube or for LinkedIn, but it does it in the theme or the tone or the, the method of the videos that you're you feed into it, which could be yours or someone else's or a combination of it. Is that a tool?

1:37:37 - Mekaiel Abdullahi
It's expensive. It's a thousand dollars a year.

1:37:40 - Trent Christopher
Which is about a hundred bucks or something.

1:37:43 - Mekaiel Abdullahi
Yeah.

1:37:44 - Chris Andrade
But if you use it a lot, then yeah, but it's like, is that something that can be beneficial for wolf sheds? And if they have all the video and if we're able to figure out a way to pump out the media, let's over media. Yeah. I

1:38:01 - Trent Christopher
Maybe. Do they have any model videos? Meaning, is there someone else that's creating videos on YouTube that they really like in the same kind of format that are successful?

1:38:14 - Chris Andrade
No. That would be the trick right there.

1:38:19 - Trent Christopher
Poppy AI is designed for... Yeah, there, click on that.

1:38:25 - Mekaiel Abdullahi
Oh, you're the top one. Or you can do that too. It's fine.

1:38:30 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
So it works off of like, there's working examples out there. Yeah. Yeah. It's designed to pull from working examples.

1:38:40 - Trent Christopher
Right. Yeah. You can organize your ideas, your assets, like all the different things to help you create your content plan. I don't know...

1:38:59 - Mekaiel Abdullahi
don't

1:39:00 - Trent Christopher
I if it's going to be a tool immediately that's immediately valuable for wolfsheds.

1:39:07 - Chris Andrade
I would consider some of the white labeling stuff.

1:39:09 - Mekaiel Abdullahi
I don't know if you looked at Crystal's post, but some of that, I feel like some of that stuff would be useful to get. You're about Krista? Yeah, Krista, yeah, sorry. Krista, Krista Green? Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1:39:24 - Trent Christopher
We have her, we have her white label sheet.

1:39:28 - Mekaiel Abdullahi
Yeah, I should have her too. I say we have that somewhere.

1:39:32 - Trent Christopher
I swear we put that somewhere. Did she DM it to us?

1:39:36 - Mekaiel Abdullahi
love DMing it to us. Yeah, she DMed it to us.

1:39:38 - Trent Christopher
I have it and you have it. Oh, there it is.

1:39:48 - Mekaiel Abdullahi
I think I downloaded it somewhere. I downloaded it somewhere. Where did I put it? You know how it is?

1:39:56 - Trent Christopher
Yeah, so. I think I found it. I if it's going to be a tool immediately that's immediately valuable for wolfsheds. I would consider some of the white labeling stuff.

1:40:09 - Mekaiel Abdullahi
I don't know if you looked at Crystal's post, but some of that, I feel like some of that stuff would be useful to get.

1:40:19 - Trent Christopher
You're about Krista? Yeah, Krista, yeah, sorry. Krista, Krista Green? Yeah, yeah, yeah. We have her, we have her white label sheet. Yeah, I should have her too. I say we have that somewhere. I swear we put that somewhere.

1:40:34 - Chris Andrade
Did she DM it to us? love DMing it to us. Yeah, she DMed it to us. I have it and you have it. Oh, there it is.

1:40:48 - Trent Christopher
I think I downloaded it somewhere. I downloaded it somewhere. Where did I put it? You know how it is? Yeah, so.

1:40:58 - Chris Andrade
I think I found it. There's your services.

1:41:05 - Trent Christopher
So you got AI twin services, AI monthly content packages, because there's AI twin monthly content packages. So let's see what else AI content without an AI twin. So if you don't want an AI twin, meaning somebody that looks like you doing stuff, short form videos Lifestyle content, b-roll package, voiceover.

1:41:33 - Chris Andrade
How the hell are all these videos and content captured? And this is just to post it? Like post production it?

1:41:45 - Mekaiel Abdullahi
Go, go down, go down and stop here at social media management just for a second. Or I just stopped there for a second.

1:41:53 - Chris Andrade
Says clients must provide their own photos and videos. Yeah. Okay. Bye. That's great. But what they're going to do is they're going to take your videos and your pictures, and they're going to build out a social media content schedule with all the things that they need to do to be able to post it all, right?

1:42:14 - Trent Christopher
So they'll do eight posts a month, but they're not just taking a picture and posting it. They're going to do it. They're going to process it through their methodology, get the proper tagging, make sure it has the proper title, make sure that it has – they're going to run it through their process. They're make sure it's optimized. Mekaiel, is this what we were talking about initially with how we were trying to develop this with our video editor guy?

1:42:42 - Chris Andrade
Yeah, the same kind of idea. He's offering some of the same services, but not to the extent that they're doing it.

1:42:48 - Trent Christopher
He's probably doing some of the just some of the videos. You're telling me right now that I can pay these guys to get eight posts?

1:43:00 - Chris Andrade
So what was the 12 posts a month?

1:43:02 - Trent Christopher
Yeah, go down. Go down. Go post a month, a thousand bucks.

1:43:10 - Chris Andrade
Content already, especially. So Krista said that she offers the services to people that are inside the accelerator at wholesale price. So if you want to resell it to one of our clients, the suggested range is $1,200 to $1,800 to $2,800 a month for 12 posts a month. Do you realize that I was about ready to start paying $150 for a 30-second short per short? Yeah, I wouldn't do that. I was about ready to pull the trigger because that was the best deal I got. You guys. Business website, eight pages, they're charging $2,500 wholesale, but look, they're offering to sell at $6,000 to $10,000. You guys, once SNS has their daily operating costs down, and they're able to really identify an ROI calculator legitimately, and once we're able to start tracking how much the website and the Facebook analytics are really on par and they're humming, and we can actually quantifiably see iterations of whatever we decide, and if we start introducing a little bit of blips of these services, right, of like, like, I will pay for that 12th post, like right, like tomorrow.

1:44:55 - Trent Christopher
I got, I got 30 hours worth of time. High-end videos of drones, videos of deliveries, pictures, like, I don't have to worry about that. Yeah, so we can, I think that he needs to send this document to you, so that you can glance over it. I think I have seen it once, and yeah, you're right, I need to, is this in our notion somewhere? Yeah, it might be. put the link in the Google Meet chat, too. Yeah.

1:45:31 - Chris Andrade
Oh, yeah, it's in this chat, but it gets lost, so you need to make sure you grab it. Yeah, I'll save it to my desktop, I'll download it. This is, this is like, so dude, this, you're selling, like, we can, we're getting wholesale prices on this stuff, guys? Yeah.

1:45:53 - Trent Christopher
Yeah, that's the way Krista described it to me. I got, I jumped on her call, and I asked her about this, and she said that.

1:45:59 - Chris Andrade
That's right

1:46:00 - Trent Christopher
What she's doing is anybody in the accelerator gets it at the same wholesale price to apply it to our agency, okay, however we want to use it, right?

1:46:08 - Chris Andrade
If you want to use it in your business or whatever, internally, she's offering wholesale price. But she's saying if we want to resell it to a client, they suggest a price range. They're not enforcing it, though. Like, you can sell it for whatever you want. You want to sell it for a million dollars or you want to sell it for a dollar, that's fine, but you still got to pay $1,000. No, it's our plan initially, yes, because we need it initially.

1:46:33 - Trent Christopher
And then once we start getting it being, like, we're starting to see the trend of how lucrative one particular niche or whatever white label is. And we're like, we should probably start doing that ourselves. Yeah, that's the goal.

1:46:54 - Mekaiel Abdullahi
Yeah, I think that's kind of the goal is to be able to do some of that stuff. Yeah. the goal is to be But in some in some ways we have to say, well, what things do is worth handing off to someone else, right?

1:47:07 - Trent Christopher
Exactly. Like what? I mean, honestly, though, that is kind of a cool problem to have, right?

1:47:14 - Mekaiel Abdullahi
I mean, to have so much work to do that you can hand it off to somebody else and then you have somebody else to hand it to. Yeah, exactly. Like, I mean, that means we got we're like overloaded and, you know, like it's kind of a good problem. Yeah.

1:47:31 - Trent Christopher
So I think that this is actually a really good option if these are things that you think that you could use.

1:47:36 - Chris Andrade
I think this is a good option because I think, you know, you know, anybody that's inside the accelerator is going to be, you know, they're gonna be a plus people because they're they're killing it just like we're trying to and their their reputations on the line. Right. So. I would only work with these guys, like, honestly, like if you need work done. Right. might right? use making you're For this type of service. Yeah. Yeah. So if we need somebody to build out something like a full stack build, I have two people that we can reach out to.

1:48:12 - Trent Christopher
So when we're ready, and you got if we need it. Yeah. Yeah. And I think for me, like also like just the video stuff and stuff like that, like that dude, like I've been working with, it's just to start getting an idea.
ACTION ITEM: Review Krista Green white-label sheet; assess fit for SNS marketing - WATCH: https://fathom.video/share/DB8EPPNDUmnRMsex7xSZCoaeAq5kCXXw?timestamp=6502.9999 These guys are obviously more professional, like, you know, and when we're ready, for that, like, there's definitely something like we could do, you know?

1:48:33 - Chris Andrade
Yeah. Yeah. So, so anyway, yeah, make sure you have this, Chris, take a look at it tomorrow. So this ad like for ad management, I have two dudes. I can't like, there's so many possibilities going on. You guys, we really gotta get He's rolling in the gold right now. We need to get this onboarding system Okay. Like, legit, the faster we can get discovery calls in, I feel is like the faster we can get contracts signed. Mikel, Matthew, and I were talking about like, is there a way that we can streamline that whole process and make it just more automated? We know that we can, but we were also debating on whether or not we should spend time on that or be spending time on other things.

1:49:29 - Trent Christopher
So I think that's something that happens as the evolution of projects get completed, right?

1:49:38 - Chris Andrade
Like, I think that's like where that overlapping kind of comes into play, because eventually we're just going to be able to like, oh, we can use this here. Oh, yeah, let's copy that into this. Like, I would imagine that's how things would play out. I don't know. know, I mean, right now.

1:49:58 - Trent Christopher
We're, we're.

1:50:00 - Chris Andrade
Once we get it fully automated, where it's like a full flow from transcription to opportunity matrix, we know that it takes us three days to go from transcript to proposal, you know what I mean?

1:50:23 - Trent Christopher
And then we could actually... Days? Days? You're talking about days? In three days?

1:50:31 - Chris Andrade
Come on.

1:50:32 - Trent Christopher
I want to get it down to hours or minutes. Okay. Well, I'm saying like, from the time... I mean, yeah. Okay, cool. Again, you guys bring me back to reality. We should be able to do it in hours or minutes. That would be like phenomenal, like being able to set up a discovery and close within that freaking... Day? Day? same day? Day? You guys... Like, dude, like, I'm just seeing, like, again, I'm just trying just to keep grounded here because I could just see how easy the scalability will happen once we just start having the conversations. Yeah, yeah. So, but anyway, yeah, we were talking about it. This is real, real. We have other things that we need to do. Like, we have a lot of things to pay attention to.

1:51:26 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
We only have an amount of time and attention that we can spend on things. So, do we automate our process or do we work on the other things that are, like, for example, plotter mechanics?

1:51:38 - Trent Christopher
We know that is critical to make sure that that goes through and that works well because we're hoping and expecting that we're going to have a long term relationship with them to continue improving. So, that's critical. So, I feel like we need to be either doing it in parallel or we need to hammer one out so that we can focus on the other one. Right. It's like one or the other. I mean, I guess that's really the only options we have unless we just say no to one of them completely.

1:52:07 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
We could also do like a few hours a week on the automation stuff and then hammer on the current project.

1:52:15 - Trent Christopher
Yeah, you're talking about having time budgets, right? Per week or per day, that kind of thing, right? Per period of time. And that might be one of the better ways to try to balance it out, really to be honest. And then another idea is what I was thinking is literally like have autoclawed working in the background on stuff that we just are not super prioritizing.

1:52:36 - Chris Andrade
Yeah, we need to figure that out like you've been doing that. And we need to figure out how to set it up so they can build these things that we have ideas on that we need to get done while we're working on something else. And I was doing that today, not the way you're doing it, but I was doing that today with my laptop off to the side. I'm like vibe coding.

1:52:56 - Trent Christopher
I'm vibing on the left and then I'm doing my other work. And then. And once it's done, then I'm like, okay, vibe a little bit, and then go back to what I was doing, so.

1:53:05 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Yep, yep. And then we need to manually review at certain points in that process, so we'll figure it out. Yeah, we'll figure it out, but I am going to call it a night, but if you guys need to, I'm obviously available via chat. Short phone call or meeting or something tomorrow, I can probably do, but anything that's lengthily I'll have to avoid until later, so. Okay. All right. All the time. All right, guys. Well, good powwow. Welcome to my madness of thought process to workbook one. Yeah. Yeah. Appreciate it. Now I can start pulling that over, and then maybe I'll get to sleep tonight. We'll see. No, you'll be able to go do this again, and this, and then be like, oh, . Oh, damn. Exactly, exactly. I need like a, well, yeah. I was gonna say I need another. We'll days! But really, I just need to figure out how to use two computers better. All right, guys. Well, guys have a good night. I'll talk to you tomorrow. You too. See ya. All right, you guys. See ya.
