## Pain Points Identified

### 1. Lead Volume Collapse (CRITICAL)
- Paused ~$400/month paid ads in October
- Traffic down to ~25% of prior levels
- Phones no longer ringing
- Both foot traffic AND web/phone leads affected

### 2. Website Issues
- Mobile UX problems hurting conversion
- Broken embeds from hosting changes
- Storage migration caused layout issues
- SEO visibility dropped for "sheds near me"

### 3. Repetitive Inquiry Time Drain
- Answering same questions repeatedly
- Pricing, RTO terms, timelines
- Happens on Facebook and messages
- Info exists in listings but not found by customers

### 4. Delivery/Ops Friction
- NetSuite passes minimal info to dealers
- Dispatch texting/call follow-up failures
- Caused cancellations and irate customers
- Dealers can't communicate directly through Graceland system

### 5. Custom Order Build Errors
- ~5-6 out of ~40 orders last year (12-15%)
- Door/window sides/swings built incorrectly
- Causes rebuilds adding 2+ weeks
- High reputational cost
- One lost expansion worth ~$24k via word-of-mouth damage

### 6. Analytics Gaps
- Uncertain attribution
- Limited understanding of current data
- Need better dashboards
- Can't quantify lost opportunities or CAC/ROAS

---

## Specific Requirements

### Website Rebuild
- Mobile-first UX
- Clear inventory pages
- Fixed embeds/storage issues
- Improved SEO for "sheds near me" in Northern AZ

### AI/Automation
- Chatbots for FAQs and lead triage (24/7)
- Pre-prompted flows: payments, RTO, timelines, quotes
- Deploy on website AND Facebook
- Escalate to human when needed (preserve human touch they value)

### Funnel Restoration
- Paid traffic plan (Facebook/Google)
- Measurable analytics with clear attribution
- On/off testing capability

### Operational SOPs
- Lead-to-delivery documentation
- Checklists at plant pickup tied to order spec
- Catch misbuilds before delivery

### Analytics Stack
- Connect: website, ads, Facebook, Zoho
- End-to-end dashboards
- Quantify lost opportunities and CAC/ROAS

### Promotion Mechanism
- Voucher/promo system
- Aligned with new Graceland commission structure
- Drive lot visits without eroding margin
