Do you remember Gray Eyes? 
S
Speaker 2
00:04
Gray Eyes. 
S
Speaker 1
00:06
He were. Eli Gray Eyes. He worked for Mark. 
S
Speaker 2
00:09
Oh, yeah. Oh, no, the very. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay. 
S
Speaker 1
00:14
Finally. So Scott went, like, last year looking for him, and he was busy doing work for his uncle. 
S
Speaker 2
00:23
He's so cool. That was. He was like. He was like the first guy. Like, the really first guy. Right? 
S
Speaker 1
00:28
Huh? 
S
Speaker 2
00:29
Yeah, I remember him. His name was Gray Eyes. Yeah, I remember. 
S
Speaker 1
00:32
Yeah. Really intelligent. He does. Architect. 
S
Speaker 2
00:35
He was a solid dude. Like, he was like one of the best Native Americans I've ever met. Right. 
S
Speaker 1
00:42
So anyway, Scott had done a repo of his cousin. I guess his cousin had hung himself. And. Oh, and Scott went to repo the building, and he left a message telling them, you know, we need to get a hold of Gray Eyes. You know, here's my car. Tell him to call or come by as soon as he can. This was like, what, a year or two ago, huh? A year and a half ago. At least a year and a half ago. 
S
Speaker 2
01:14
Well, today. 
S
Speaker 1
01:16
Yeah, he just came by today. Yeah. And I was there. And you know how I am when I meet people. I could either tell them they're full of or liars, or I just get that feeling when I shake their hands. Yeah. Well, I took them into the office and we just started talking about everything. I told them how easy the sales are now. And he says, would you mind, like, if we're. We don't have customers and we're not busy, that I do architectural work, too? And I said, not at all. He goes, do you know if you guys would be interested in opening a lot in Kayenta? He goes, because my brother wants to work for you too. And I said, you know what? I said, you're about the second or third person to talk to me about opening another lot. 
S
Speaker 1
02:20
I said, let me talk to my boss and I'll. I'll give you answer. He goes, well, for sure. You got. You got my brother. And I. He goes, I'll work it, too, but, you know, like three days a week. 
S
Speaker 2
02:33
And then my brother, he would take. He'll be able to work tuba. 
S
Speaker 1
02:37
I'm talking. 
S
Speaker 2
02:39
Sorry. 
S
Speaker 1
02:40
Yeah, I don't want him the whole week. Because the way I feel is that he can help his brother out over there too, right? So he gave me his number, I gave him mine. I talked to Scott Passmore. He goes, absolutely. That's on the border. Utah, huh? 
S
Speaker 2
03:04
And I said, yeah, yeah. He goes, that's Four Corners area, Mom*. 
S
Speaker 1
03:10
He said, this is what Scott said. 
S
Speaker 2
03:13
Passmore. You got last names? 
S
Speaker 1
03:16
Passmore said, as long as we can get Scott Bomier help by like opening the hub in the middle for you guys. Oh, he can pull the buildings from the hub and deliver them and so. 
S
Speaker 2
03:36
Create another hub in Northern Arizona just for us. That's so smart. So this is why. Okay, Mom*. And we're recording this conversation because we just had a meeting about this with the guys. We're working on the deliverables that we want to provide. SNS Woolsheds. Right. This ties in perfectly to what I was saying you guys need. What you need is a checklist to. To follow every single day, to hold the representative that you pay to sit on that dealership responsible for. And that checklist is meant to be able to hold that person accountable, to follow a. Just a simple checklist of like, did you get gas today? Do you need gas tomorrow? Like, yeah, that kind of stupid stuff, right? Did you turn the lights on? Are the doors shut? Did you make sure all the keys are put away? 
S
Speaker 2
04:47
Did you spend an hour cleaning up the lot, like, picking up trash? Like, you know what I'm saying? Just like stuff like that, right? And create a way to hold these dealerships responsible. Right? And then, so then we have a way to hold some sort of level of accountability, right? And when we do that, what that does is then we get to see how much they're interacting with. Now, this new accountable system that we have, Are they make. Are they checking the boxes? Are they doing the checklist? Are they adding the pictures of the lot when we need them? Are they giving good pictures of the buildings? Like being able to give some sort of way to make these dealerships accountable. Right? And then so when we go for our monthly reviews, whoever's on that system or logged in that dealership, right? 
S
Speaker 2
05:53
Then we can give performance reviews and then get like, yeah, you guys are killing it. You deserve a bonus. You know what I mean? 
S
Speaker 1
06:00
Well, that's what I was saying. I was thinking, you know, if we keep like that spreadsheet, we keep who is the sales on what day and what buildings they sold. And I told them, I said, I'm even willing to pay quarterly bonus something. 
S
Speaker 2
06:24
So this is what I mean by if we create this checklist system, at least give us at least something to start building off of, right? And if we focus on creating the. So of what Sandra Santa's standard is of what she wants every dealership to look like. 
S
Speaker 1
06:44
Yeah. 
S
Speaker 2
06:44
She wants every dealership to do this. Every dealership to feel like this. And every customer is meant to go through this process to make sure we make them feel like this. Right. And that way then if people aren't. If we get complaints or something's wrong or something's broken or. So maybe it's the. Maybe you need to supply that one dealership with something unique because they're unique. So now you have the information to support that dealer to the best of your abilities. Right. And now that's what we're trying to get at. Because from what we do, once we do that, then we can create a how to guide. 
S
Speaker 1
07:34
Yeah. 
S
Speaker 2
07:35
And now they can upload that 360 images to the. To the website. How to. Now we. Now they give a. An instruction to update the website. How do you update the website? You know what I mean? And now we make the dealership, the person running the dealership be responsible to upload their pictures to that dealership's website. Right, right. And how do we make them do that though? Well, we have to create the systems to create the flowcharts and the instructions on how to do that. Right. This is what I think is how we at least eliminate the issue with dealerships and finding quality help. 
S
Speaker 1
08:24
So I'm not done talking. 
S
Speaker 2
08:26
Okay. 
S
Speaker 1
08:28
So I talked to Passmore and he is more than excited about it because he's been wanting to get into, Utah. 
S
Speaker 2
08:42
Right. So do we. 
S
Speaker 1
08:45
So yes, we'll be into Utah too. Southern Utah. 
S
Speaker 2
08:53
So where does this fall in an alliance with the three dealership rule though? 
S
Speaker 1
09:01
No one is up towards there at all. I'm all by myself in Tuba City. 
S
Speaker 2
09:08
I guess you're true. So nobody could touch you. So even if somebody wanted to try to open up something up there, they couldn't. 
S
Speaker 1
09:17
They could. They can't for 25 years. Mom*. 
S
Speaker 2
09:24
Dude. Mom*. 
S
Speaker 1
09:25
Do you know who tried? 
S
Speaker 2
09:27
Who? 
S
Speaker 1
09:28
Chris and his wife. 
S
Speaker 2
09:31
Who's chris? 
S
Speaker 1
09:33
What's his last name? 
S
Speaker 2
09:34
Oh, Willie. 
S
Speaker 1
09:35
Willie. Willie, yeah, Willie and his wife. Yep. No, in. In the Navajo Nation. Cuba City. 
S
Speaker 2
09:47
And they said. 
S
Speaker 1
09:50
Yeah, they told him, no, we only. We already have a dealership. And, and how I found out is the guy that works at the chapter house told my security guard and he told me. 
S
Speaker 2
10:05
Oh my gosh. Well, yeah, do you know what that. 
S
Speaker 1
10:09
And Now I have 25 years. But I'm not done. 
S
Speaker 2
10:12
Okay, keep going. 
S
Speaker 1
10:13
So anyway, I told him, I said I'm more than willing to open up a dealer there, but what about property? Do you know of any property that I can get a hold of and something at least an acre? So they told me not one, but two places that are legitly. Cleaned out, ready to go. Lots of that are more than an acre. So Scott, my husband and I have to go and check out the lots, talk to the chapter house. And that's another thing. Gray eye says, don't worry about the license. I'll get your license. I got hookups. He goes, and we're trying to expand Kayenta. And I'd be. I'd get your license, I get your. Your lease, and you can come up and choose one of the two lots. Okay, So I told Passmore this. 
S
Speaker 1
11:20
He goes, get me a coordination coordinates and from there we start looking for hublots. 
S
Speaker 2
11:28
Mom*, can you hire me to go with you to go do the drone footage and reconnaissance to prove. 
S
Speaker 1
11:36
Well, yeah, but I gota. I gotta find which one I want to go with first. 
S
Speaker 2
11:41
Well, why not go check both of them out? 
S
Speaker 1
11:44
I am. 
S
Speaker 2
11:45
So let me go with you and I'll go bring my drone and we'll do both of them. 
S
Speaker 1
11:52
When can we do it, Scott? Saturday. You're not. Yeah, you're not delivering. Alex doesn't go in the hospital till 10:30 at night. If you can come up here Saturday morning, we can go. I'm going this weekend. That's how fast we're moving on this. 
S
Speaker 2
12:16
I need a car, Mom*. 
S
Speaker 1
12:20
Let me get this lot open. And that's another thing. I'm gonna have to be using the new car because I still have to go and check on them at least one or two days a week. So I'm going to be driving to Kayenta, then to Tuba and check on them. And then. 
S
Speaker 2
12:40
Well, this is where this accountability checklist needs to come in, Mom*. And guys. So this is for the note. I know. No, I know, but this is for the note taker. Like take that into effect of how we can implement the system to accommodate this. Daily check in to make sure that they are keeping up with the standards. Because mom, you gotta think of. 
S
Speaker 1
13:04
Well, I think I got it. I just need to meet the brother and see how he is just speaking to gray eyes. He's very intelligent. 
S
Speaker 2
13:15
I know he is. I know he is. 
S
Speaker 1
13:17
He's intelligent. He. I could tell. Dad says he's trustworthy. 
S
Speaker 2
13:22
I know he is. 
S
Speaker 1
13:23
And he's a hard worker dad, Dedicated. Yeah, yeah. 
S
Speaker 2
13:29
Dad, what ways can we be screwed here with. With this type of setup? Like, if there was a way that we could get screwed. Which way? Like, like how can they. How can they steal money from us? In other words, the only way that. 
S
Speaker 1
13:48
They'D be able to is if there was a Large deposit or something. But yeah, that. There's accountability on that. Because mom sees it. Yeah. 
S
Speaker 2
13:57
How does mom see it? 
S
Speaker 1
13:59
Because the down payments, you put it down whether it's a credit card, debit card, cash or money order or check. Before you put in the down payment, you have to choose one of those four. So if it's cash, naturally I'm going to know. Okay, you owe me a thousand $155 for the down payment. Where is it? And I would have to go and pick it up. Or they can drop it off at Wells Fargo. Oh, yeah, I can open. And I can open up a Wells Fargo for them. There's one in Kayenta and there's one in Tuba. So they can just go and deposit into Wells Fargo. I can pull it out and then send the money order to Graceland. 
S
Speaker 2
14:52
And you won't have to drive there to do that every sale. 
S
Speaker 1
14:55
No, no, but I do have to. 
S
Speaker 2
14:58
Daily deposit type situation. 
S
Speaker 1
15:02
Daily deposit? Yeah, he can get. Yeah, he can do daily deposits. 
S
Speaker 2
15:07
He would have to. Right, especially so that would be a part of his. That would be a part of his daily check in his closing. Yeah, so on his way. So he would clock out when he deposit his check. 
S
Speaker 1
15:22
Right. 
S
Speaker 2
15:23
So that's how we can hold him accountable. 
S
Speaker 1
15:27
Right. 
S
Speaker 2
15:28
Clock out every day is you send a picture of the deposit. But what happens on days that don't get deposited? 
S
Speaker 1
15:38
I'm gonna have cameras and I see what time they come in and what time they leave. 
S
Speaker 2
15:44
Well, what if we submit. What if we have a lock that they have to submit a picture of it being locked every day before they leave? 
S
Speaker 1
15:54
Well, like I said, I have security cameras in Tuba and I'll do the same thing. And the. Yeah, so I have to go check. 
S
Speaker 2
16:05
I have. 
S
Speaker 1
16:05
I don't know what's there. 
S
Speaker 2
16:07
Oh, gotcha. So if we needed to run a solar generating power system to do. Just to do the security system, the thing that we've been talking about doing for a while, might be worth it. 
S
Speaker 1
16:17
Yeah, solar. 
S
Speaker 2
16:19
Yeah. Well, that's. Remember that solar kit guy who can design a solar kit to a portable building to do exactly that? 
S
Speaker 1
16:27
Yeah, yeah. 
S
Speaker 2
16:28
I mean, this gives us an avenue to invest in something like that if we need it. 
S
Speaker 1
16:34
Yeah. And. And eventually we'll want to do it in Williams too. 
S
Speaker 2
16:39
I know, I. That's what we've been wanting to do for a while. 
S
Speaker 1
16:43
Yeah. 
S
Speaker 2
16:45
Well, hey, just so, because we're on recording here, are we still locked in for giving us the 10,000 by the end of January or beginning of February 1st to get all this stuff done. Are we still good for that budget? Are we only good for 5000? 
S
Speaker 1
17:09
Is it 5000 or 10,000? You. You went from 5000, 10,000. 
S
Speaker 2
17:14
5000 is the first iteration, and then the second iteration is going to be another 5,000. So it's 10,000 total. 
S
Speaker 1
17:22
Okay. Yes. 
S
Speaker 2
17:24
By February 1st. 
S
Speaker 1
17:27
Yes. 
S
Speaker 2
17:28
Because we're just trying to get in order for everybody to. We're just trying to gauge where we're sitting right now because we're ready to put an application in, too. So. 
S
Speaker 1
17:36
So this is what else I was going to talk to you about. I've been in Tuba the past two. 
S
Speaker 2
17:42
Days. 
S
Speaker 1
17:45
Doing massive sales, and I've had so many people come looking for 1440s and this and that. Big buildings, they're checking them out, getting numbers, because they keep saying they're coming in with their income tax. I have one lady coming on Friday and then another lady coming in two weeks to buy 1440s. So it's picking up. So when you guys. I'm telling you, if February's a good day, that's going to work for us. Because what. 
S
Speaker 2
18:24
Because we're going to take off thinking. This is what we're thinking. This is where I'm trying to get the understanding. So I think, mom, we should put the money towards the sop. Like, we're talking about that checklist creating a wolf. It looks like we may be able to create some sort of app that's proprietary to you. Right. That each person has its own login. 
S
Speaker 1
18:47
Right. 
S
Speaker 2
18:49
Each person has its own checklist that they have to do every single day. Right. 
S
Speaker 1
18:54
Wait, what's more important is the website, mom, hold on. 
S
Speaker 2
18:59
What is important with the website that's not working right now? 
S
Speaker 1
19:05
I don't know. You guys were discussing. 
S
Speaker 2
19:08
That's what we're trying to say here is we can put more. More the bigger. To. In order. Like for the instance you're gonna have, you're building another dealership that you're gonna have to manage, right? Yeah, but you don't have a way to manage them. 
S
Speaker 1
19:29
Yes, I do. It's called a vehicle. I'm driving my ass off. 
S
Speaker 2
19:33
Exactly. But in order for them to keep a set of standards to make sure that your brand is overall protected. Right. You don't have a way to do that. And that's where I'm trying to say is that, okay, we need to put that money towards building that. And then the first. And then what happens when you do that? Now you have this system that hold people accountable, and then we can start seeing results, right? 
S
Speaker 1
20:07
Yeah. 
S
Speaker 2
20:08
Because make sure. What if we make sure that everybody has to put a post one day for that dealership? 
S
Speaker 1
20:16
Yeah. 
S
Speaker 2
20:17
And everybody's responsible to do at least one post of their favorite building one time a day. Part of their work, their. Their checklist. 
S
Speaker 1
20:27
Well, so let's go back to. I need to go check out lots, because I would like to get things going by the end of February or March. 
S
Speaker 2
20:43
Oh, damn. So you want to have that lot open by then? 
S
Speaker 1
20:47
Yes, and I think we could do it, but we got to be smart with the money, because I gotta find a building. I got it insulated. I got a drywall. It. 
S
Speaker 2
20:57
I gotta have ready buildings that we have sitting right now ready to go out of the ones you have sitting in the backyard. Nothing. Yeah, because why not? Let's find a car. I can get Clay to go up there and. And redo it and fix it. Get it ready to go. 
S
Speaker 1
21:17
Okay. 
S
Speaker 2
21:19
And get the building just beautiful. Get the office just beautiful. Spend good. Spend like. 
S
Speaker 1
21:25
And that way I won't have to get a building. 
S
Speaker 2
21:27
Right. How much would you cost to spend the bill to get the building? 
S
Speaker 1
21:32
No, I said I wouldn't have to buy a building. 
S
Speaker 2
21:34
Okay, but how much did you spend to retro out the office in Williams? 
S
Speaker 1
21:39
About three grand. 
S
Speaker 2
21:41
Okay. And I think. And. And I think Clay could do that with. With. I. I'll get. I'll get. I'll see what he'll. Cause Just give me the. 
S
Speaker 1
21:53
We'll figure it out dimensions. Okay. 
S
Speaker 2
21:55
And then he can just do it. 
S
Speaker 1
21:57
That one's harsh. Partially done. It just needs to be finished. 
S
Speaker 2
22:02
Well, just send me pictures and all that. 
S
Speaker 1
22:03
And it is already have electrical. 
S
Speaker 2
22:06
And then all. All he has to do is just finish it out, right? 
S
Speaker 1
22:10
Yeah. 
S
Speaker 2
22:10
And then we'll have that office building ready to go, and we'll get it all. Security gated everything out. 
S
Speaker 1
22:16
Yep. 
S
Speaker 2
22:18
And that should only cost us three, four grand. 
S
Speaker 1
22:21
Yeah. 
S
Speaker 2
22:23
And then boom. Office done now. And so. And then. So this is. 
S
Speaker 1
22:30
So here's the thing. Okay. 
S
Speaker 2
22:33
Is I don't have another job. This is my sole job right now. Right. So I am giving everything I got to this agency. Right. And we need to get to $50,000 a month. And right now we're right around 20, and there's only two of you. So I'm not saying this 10,000 is going to get us to February. Right. Then that will get us to March. But then the next 10,000 that we're trying to get out of S and S Woolsheds it's going to have a plan that is say, hey, you're going to give us 10,000 and we're not going to get. We'll get the 10,000 will be made back in six weeks. 
S
Speaker 1
23:24
Yeah. 
S
Speaker 2
23:25
So you're going to turn 10,000 back into 10,000 in six weeks. 
S
Speaker 1
23:30
Okay. 
S
Speaker 2
23:31
And then develop a plan where we keep making you back that 10,000. Eventually that 10,000 is going to be made back in a week, two weeks. 
S
Speaker 1
23:42
Yeah. 
S
Speaker 2
23:42
Now that 10,000. Now you're making that 10,000 is making you 15,000 in four weeks. 20,000 in six weeks. But it's like we have to prove it. Right. And that's where developing those little sops and how the dealerships are managed. That's why we have to do that is because. 
S
Speaker 1
24:01
Yeah. 
S
Speaker 2
24:02
It's the only way to quantify things. Right. So this is exciting news, Mom*. Like things are just coming together. 
S
Speaker 1
24:10
I'm gonna be busy, but I'm doing this because you guys are gonna take over. I don't care if you don't want to leave Phoenix. You will. I can't do this my whole life, Mom*. 
S
Speaker 2
24:25
This is why we need to put this in place. So we can hire people at a decent wage where they're making a decent living. 
S
Speaker 1
24:35
Right. 
S
Speaker 2
24:36
And we can provide families to live in. In. In these areas. Flagstaff, Winslow Williams, Tuba and Gray Eyes. 
S
Speaker 1
24:48
Already lives over there. 
S
Speaker 2
24:50
You know what I mean? Like, listen. 
S
Speaker 1
24:52
Yeah. 
S
Speaker 2
24:52
Literally just all. And then this is our next step would be Utah. And then from Utah we go to Oregon. And from Oregon we go to Washington, Montana, Idaho. Like this. We just keep going up. We keep going. 
S
Speaker 1
25:07
I want to retire, Mom*. 
S
Speaker 2
25:10
But the way we do that is by creating these systems. So then it just a copy and paste and then we hire the right. 
S
Speaker 1
25:18
People that I think Gray Eyes is definitely. I need him talk to the brother and interview him. 
S
