## Accountability System Details

### Why It's Needed
- Sandra currently manages by driving: "Yes, I do. It's called a vehicle. I'm driving my ass off." (19:29)
- With Kayenta opening, she'll need to drive to Kayenta > Tuba > check on them regularly
- No way to ensure brand standards are maintained across locations

### Deposit Accountability
- Payment methods: credit card, debit card, cash, money order, check
- For cash: Sandra knows exact amount owed from system
- Wells Fargo branches in both Kayenta and Tuba for deposits
- Daily deposit with photo proof before clock-out
- Security cameras verify arrival/departure times

### Security Infrastructure
- Security cameras at Tuba (existing)
- Same setup needed for Kayenta
- Solar-powered security system discussed for remote locations
- "Solar kit guy" reference - can design solar for portable buildings

  - Chris: "He was a solid dude. Like, he was like one of the best Native Americans I've ever met."
- **History with Family:** Known since 2016, worked with Scott (dad), Chris, and Austin

## Website vs Accountability Debate

**Sandra's concern (18:54):** "Wait, what's more important is the website"

**Chris's response (19:08-19:33):**
- "What is important with the website that's not working right now?"
- Sandra: "I don't know. You guys were discussing."
- Chris pivoted to accountability: "You're building another dealership that you're gonna have to manage... but you don't have a way to manage them."

**Resolution:** Chris advocated for accountability system priority given expansion. Website is secondary concern that came from earlier discussions.

## Long-Term Vision

**Sandra (24:10):** "I'm gonna be busy, but I'm doing this because you guys are gonna take over. I don't care if you don't want to leave Phoenix. You will. I can't do this my whole life."

**Chris's response (24:25, 25:10):**
- "This is why we need to put this in place. So we can hire people at a decent wage where they're making a decent living."
- "But the way we do that is by creating these systems. So then it just a copy and paste and then we hire the right people."
