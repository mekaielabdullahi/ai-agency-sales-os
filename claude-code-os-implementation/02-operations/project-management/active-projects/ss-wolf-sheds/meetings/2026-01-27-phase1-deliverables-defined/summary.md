## Meeting Purpose

Refine the SNS Wolfsheds proposal and storyboard the client presentation.

---

## Key Takeaways

1. **Phase 1 Offer: $5k, 2-3 Week Implementation** - Fix SNS's "lead leakage" by capturing organic lot visitors via QR codes

2. **Core Features** - QR-code system for lead capture, Clerk.com for seamless user profiles, Gmail alerts for immediate staff notification

3. **ROI Justification** - $5k investment recouped by converting just one additional lead (average sale is $8k)

4. **Presentation Strategy** - Visual storyboard to demonstrate system value, framed as partnership to build key case study for Arise

---

## Problems Identified

### Uncaptured Organic Leads
- SNS Wolfsheds currently captures zero information from organic visitors who browse the lot and leave
- This "lead leakage" represents significant lost revenue
- Prevents data-driven decision-making
- Goal: Capture all leads, creating a database to inform future ad spend and strategy

---

## Solutions Defined

### Phase 1: Foundational Lead Capture ($5k)

**Goal:** Stop lead leakage by capturing visitor info via QR codes on shed placards

**Process Flow:**
1. Visitor scans QR code → Lands on lead capture page
2. Visitor provides name/phone number → Receives small incentive (e.g., 10% off delivery, a $300 value)
3. Staff receive instant Gmail notification with new lead's info

**Technology Stack:**
| Component | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Clerk.com** | User management tool for seamless, free customer profiles (up to 10k users) |
| **Dynamic QR Codes** | Allow easy tracking and future content changes |

**Timeline:** 2-3 weeks (under-promising to enable over-delivery)

---

### Future Phases: Advanced Features

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Customer Profiles** | Track which sheds each logged-in visitor scans |
| **Sales Dashboard** | Visualize lead activity (daily scans, conversion rates) |
| **Automated Follow-up** | Simple email campaigns for captured leads |
| **Value-Added Services** | Referrals for related needs (site prep, tree trimming) |

---

## Presentation Strategy & Storyboard

The presentation will use a visual storyboard to demonstrate the system's value.

**Narrative Flow:**
1. **Customer Journey:** Arrival → Scan QR code on placard → Receive incentive → Browse lot
2. **Staff Experience:** Instant Gmail alert with lead info → Approach customer with relevant details

**Closing Pitch:** Frame the project as a partnership to build a key case study for Arise, following the successful Plotter Mechanics project.

---

## Internal Tools & Research

- **SNS Data:** Chris shared spreadsheet with shed inventory and hyperlinks - will be fed to Claude to inform proposal
- **Personal AI Assistant:** Chris plans to install Claude-based bot on dedicated Dell Precision laptop (i9, GTX 490, 32GB RAM) to manage communications from Slack, WhatsApp, and email
