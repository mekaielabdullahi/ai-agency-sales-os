## Fathom Summary

### Meeting Purpose

Refine the SNS Wolfsheds proposal and storyboard the client presentation.

### Key Takeaways

- Phase 1 Offer: A $5k, 2–3 week implementation to fix SNS's "lead leakage" by capturing organic lot visitors via QR codes.
- Core Features: A QR-code system for lead capture, Clerk.com for seamless user profiles, and Gmail alerts for immediate staff notification.
- ROI Justification: The $5k investment is recouped by converting just one additional lead, as the average sale is $8k.
- Presentation Strategy: A visual storyboard will demonstrate the system's value, framed as a partnership to build a key case study for Arise.

---

## Topics Discussed

### The Problem: Uncaptured Organic Leads

- SNS Wolfsheds currently captures zero information from organic visitors who browse the lot and leave.
- This "lead leakage" represents significant lost revenue and prevents data-driven decision-making.
- The goal is to capture all leads, creating a database to inform future ad spend and strategy.

### The Solution: A Phased Digital Sales Engine

#### Phase 1: Foundational Lead Capture ($5k)

**Goal:** Stop lead leakage by capturing visitor info via QR codes on shed placards.

**Process:**

1. Visitor scans QR code → Lands on a lead capture page.
2. Visitor provides name/phone number → Receives a small incentive (e.g., 10% off delivery, a $300 value).
3. Staff receive an instant Gmail notification with the new lead's info.

**Technology:**

- Clerk.com: A user management tool for seamless, free customer profiles (up to 10k users).
- Dynamic QR Codes: Allow for easy tracking and future content changes.

**Timeline:** 2–3 weeks, under-promising to enable over-delivery.

#### Future Phases: Advanced Features

- Customer Profiles: Track which sheds each logged-in visitor scans.
- Sales Dashboard: Visualize lead activity (e.g., daily scans, conversion rates).
- Automated Follow-up: Simple email campaigns for captured leads.
- Value-Added Services: Referrals for related needs (e.g., site prep, tree trimming).

### Presentation Strategy & Storyboard

- The presentation will use a visual storyboard to demonstrate the system's value.
- Narrative Flow:
  - Customer Journey: Arrival → Scan QR code on a placard → Receive incentive → Browse lot.
  - Staff Experience: Instant Gmail alert with lead info → Approach customer with relevant details.
- Closing Pitch: Frame the project as a partnership to build a key case study for Arise, following the successful Plotter Mechanics project.

### Internal Tools & Research

- SNS Data: Chris shared a spreadsheet with shed inventory and hyperlinks, which will be fed to Claude to inform the proposal.
- Personal AI Assistant: Chris plans to install a Claude-based bot on a dedicated Dell Precision laptop (i9, GTX 490, 32GB RAM) to manage communications from Slack, WhatsApp, and email.

0:05 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
I'm trying to put together a please say hi, this is Matthew.

0:15 - Chris Andrade
Hello, how are you doing? Do you have that pulled up on your screen? Do you want to go over on your? Yeah, sure.

0:33 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Let's do it.

0:47 - Chris Andrade
I can't wait. Yeah. So my daughter, maybe the best friend in kindergarten, like her very first best friend. It looks looks crazy. So, yeah, it's crazy. I don't know. When you have kids, you're going to understand one day. Matthew, how old are you again? 24 or 26?

1:14 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
I'm 31, bro. 31. 31.

1:17 - Chris Andrade
Oh, . I thought you were way younger. So is Mikael 27 then?

1:22 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
I think he's 30 or 31.

1:27 - Chris Andrade
Wow. thought, wow. All right. Well then, game on. Yeah.

1:34 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
It's time to start doing it for me.

1:41 - Chris Andrade
I'm here for you whenever you can sign. I've been told twice in a week that… Um… What we're doing, bro, and how energized I am, and what people are seeing, the value is just like when I show up, and it's kind of just crazy to see how amazing it is, and I'm trying to still understand it.

2:35 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
As soon as we get our first couple of clients happy with good reviews, and we get our systems dialed in, like today that meeting we had about client acquisition and the whole funnel, building out those things is going to make us seem so much more professional that you're just going to want to be like, here's our website, here's this.

2:59 - Chris Andrade
Yes. This is what I mean by we ultimately still have not even given that to SNS of who we are. Right? And this is what I'm trying to say is that we, because of me, are at step three, but they haven't understood step one or who or what. You know what I mean? They only hear from me. They kind of need to hear from, from the, the arise. Yeah. Because again, it's like, this is where I would like to be a third party member on this next delivery. Like, I don't want to pitch this off. Yeah. And what I just, if we can just come up with some sort, that's what I mean by the storyboard that we, ultimately talked about how So. So. So that first iteration of when somebody shows up to the dealership and they have that hyperlink right in front of their parking spot or right next to their parking spot on this really nice, dude, I've got these wooden pillars that are going to be getting made that are going to sit, like, designate the parking spots that are going to have that placard on it. And it's going to look nice, dude. And it's going to have our hyperlink and just be an overall greeting, right? I'm trying to paint the picture here for this storyboard. Yeah. And these, whatever we decide, these pillars, they're going to look inviting. And it's going to show where, when the customer comes in, now they know where to park. Boom. So, this is where we go. What's this, Gerald? Oh, greetings. Welcome to SNS. Yeah. Let's go look around. Let's No, if you have a question, scan this link. It will notify me you're here. Or, you know what I mean? Because nine times out of 10, they don't want to have to go into the office to go into the building. They just want to go straight to the building. Right? We're anticipating that. And we're just inviting them into the dealership now because they don't, they don't, like, we, like, scan this. Let us know you're here. We don't want to interrupt you. Go have fun. And then, yeah, I'll, you know, if you need me, right now, because we want to seem busy. Right? So I, if you need me, please put this button or right or whatever, and I'll come out. Just I'll be out, you know, you're notified you're here. We're doing, just wrap up this call, whatever that feel is, right? And just go look at the building, have fun. But please give us your name and phone number. Right? And then that call to action, what we talked about, right? Right? How are we going to get that name and phone number? Right? That's that. We're talking about the idea of the money model, generating the money model behind that ad campaign. Right? And what does the ad campaign look like if we're going to give away a billing and a free delivery that only SNS can offer? No other dealership can offer this. No other dealership can offer this. But click this link and you get access to that with this free monthly or quarterly drawing. That's like an $8,000 drawing. And honestly, it cost us probably $4,000, maybe $5,000. Right? Right? Imagine the interest somebody... Like, that's what I'm trying to get at, right? That call to action is probably the emphasis of the presentation that we need to make, I think. That's the wow factor, right? That's going to make my mom like, damn, you're right. Because we're not supported. Just real quick.

7:26 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
got an idea about that just now when you're talking. Because so like a full free shed delivery, I think probably like scares people at SNS because it's like, wait, that's $3,000. Like, how is that going to come back? Exactly. So what I'm thinking, my idea was like, if we say like, 10% off your delivery, and that's a $300 value, just for scanning this, it's like, am I okay with giving my data for possibility when 300 bucks?

7:59 - Chris Andrade
Like, yeah. Oh, let's do that. You know what, bro? I'm so happy you just said that. don't mean to cut you off, but maybe that's how, let's start with that call to action. Instead of my mom having to pay up the $5,000 right away, maybe that can be for a really big marketing ad campaign on Facebook. But let's say, hey, just for showing up, just for coming by, and just for giving us your name and phone number, which we have to make, like, how do we make it feel comfortable? We're not going to sell it. We're distributing it. This is just for your experience only, for your profile. So you're going to send us your name and phone number, and immediately you get a profile that gets returned to you. So when you go through our journey, you have a profile where all your buildings you scan goes to. Yeah. Now you have a selection of all the buildings you're interested in in this profile. Let's start there. Name. Because you came here, you scanned here, got that hyperlink, you get an additional, let's just say, I don't know what, we'll have to ask, I think my mom did talk about that, maybe like, a $200 or $100 credit.
ACTION ITEM: Confirm SNS incentives w/ mom; update proposal - WATCH: https://fathom.video/share/uKjUsmGq-5yXsyRthxXsUZJKMEmRUbPU?timestamp=547.9999 And so those would be questions, let's put that for the note taker of, hey, what options can we give away for this action during the meeting, right? And okay, cool, then it goes to the next, and then now we're, now they're in the system, now they're getting the hyperlink, now they're walking the dealership, ooh, this building looks cool, add to the profile, ooh, this building looks cool, add to the profile. And then you, then, whoever's at the dealership, at the lot, they're seeing where they're at, and then now they see them staying a little longer at one building, they're like, okay, that's my cue. They're at this building for a little longer. longer. They're the other. So let me go over there and let me say hi now, right? Oh, hello there. Hi. Yeah. Oh, nice to meet you. My name is Chris. It's from S&S. You like that? Yeah. There's a sale on it right now. There's a promo. Just letting you know this is the price and they'll have their tablet show them all the pricing, all that stuff.

10:23 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
And they have a copy of all the QR codes that they've scanned and they're like, Oh, I saw you were looking at this.

10:29 - Chris Andrade
We actually have a deal on that one.

10:31 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
We've been trying to move it. Like, uh, people, people, they want it, but you know, whatever the salespeople say in the backend, right?

10:39 - Chris Andrade
My mom's able to have special pricing right now on those buildings. Like, dude, we have the only 16 foot wide building sitting in our dealership and it's on a huge sale right now. Like nobody else has that sitting there. And it's a, what we call a side porch cabin. So on there did. It's going to be like S, B, P, C, side, porch, cabin. Yeah, anyways.

11:11 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
You guys have a shed that nobody else has that's a really good deal. Why is that not front and center of your website right now?

11:18 - Chris Andrade
Well, the problem is that it's a 16-foot wide, which takes extra permits. So it's a nightmare. That's why it's not selling. So, the problem is that there's, yeah, it's a nightmare. What does that mean?

11:36 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Like, I don't understand.

11:38 - Chris Andrade
So, our buildings, they go up to 14 feet wide is the standard, right? Mm-hmm. Okay. That's what our permit is for. Anything over 14 feet wide requires an additional extra wide permit. Okay, so that's why you don't want put it on your website. Well, that's why it's not selling. Because the locations and the restrictions for that extra wide is very tough. Like the fact that we even got it up there was an accomplishment. Now we can't get it out. But I'm just saying in general, we have a bunch of those, we have repos. So repos are another building selection that, dude, we have so many because we're on the Indian reservation. And I'm sorry, I don't mean that, you know, it's part of the nature is that people, the repos on Indian reservations are a lot higher. Right? So that's how Graceland makes their money. Right? And so we got more repos than the normal dealer. So we have like almost like these auctioning boards, dude. So like sometimes we have like flash sales on repo buildings because they, we just picked it up. So now we need to have like a flash set. on these repos because we can even like drive up the cost because the demand is so high so then we can even charge up a little extra because now we're generating so many interest and almost we're creating like a bidding war dude we come across that all the time yeah there's no infrastructure to support it but that's why that's why just collecting the system collecting the information just selling that to go back to the point to them when they watch why we want them to scan and give us their name and phone number after that when they do the experience and they either go now that's all our selling and then the moment close happens right then that gets into a whole other profile system of just all the other into a little bit to pop up We that they want to be, they want access to, right? Of all the other environments that SNS has or has to offer or whatever have you, you know, that's all the extra that we've been talking about, right? But ultimately, we're trying just to collect their information and then generate using the spreadsheets of the three years worth of data to support an algorithm to generate a lead sale and a lead conversion for Facebook, social media dealerships, and be able to run campaigns based off of the information that the dealerships are providing, the sales records have, and just reflect and build something that we can say, hey, I'm a little slow this month. I really need to generate. What did I do different last year? Why am I so here? You know what mean? And be able to use our historical sales to come up with a way to reference the next movement. That's where the ROI comes into play, right? How do we get them there? Right? And that's why we need to start tracking the buildings. And that's where the first $5,000 implementation comes in, because then it gives us, it paints the So if we can paint just what that story looks like and attach a $5,000 bill just to start collecting the lost revenue right now, because that's what S&S needs. They don't need an audit right now. They need to capture all the leads. And that's what this proposal is saying. $5,000 is going to stop that SIV from leaking. Now you have all the dealerships not out. Right now, we're going to focus on one, right? Because we got to test it, flow it, right? We're going to start. Hi, Staff. We're going to capture all the organic leads. We're going to say, hey, no more leaks. That sieve is captured. Every client, they're going to have a way for us to interact. Now, the ones who don't interact will have a reason to why. Like, man, why didn't we capture that dude? What happened? Right? Right. Yeah. And then from there, we have that selling point, second selling point. Now we have all your data with all your sales. Now we have a way to reference something, to build a model, to build an ad campaign that's efficient, where your ad spends will be quantified for a dollar per lead ratio. Right? You'll know how much you're spending, where you're spending, how much does organic pay out more than... then may may may may may Social media, I'd rather spend more on organic because that means I get more things on my lots to attract more attention. Should I get one of those little wishy-washy things that stand up with the flags and pay something more than just spending another bet on social media? You know what mean? Because it's like $850 for one of those. But we have no way to strategize. You know what mean? That's why just collecting the buildings, collecting the information, creating some sort of platform to be referenced to build models forward.

17:37 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
So, I also heard on the call with your brother, Matthew, that he started building out a spreadsheet, right?

17:46 - Chris Andrade
So, I think it's part of... Sorry? Do you want to export it? You want me to pull it out right now, actually? Let me share that. We probably should do that right now, not thinking of it, if I'm being honest, right? Yep. Thank that's Future It's I Thank I mean, I don't know.

18:02 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Let's, we could, I think, because we want to see if that would be part of the, we don't want to see anything that they have already built, right? But, but do you think we could look at the gamma really quick before we dive into that?

18:17 - Chris Andrade
I'm glad you thank you for putting me back on track. Thank you. No, yeah, no problem. We just, let's just, yeah, let's just look at that real quick. And then, and then, so we don't get to turn away.

18:33 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
No, it's, it's good that we like that you mapped out all that stuff. Cause like you said, in the very beginning of this call, like we're going to, we want to storyboard it. We want to, we want to figure out like, what is, what are we going to communicate? That's like, whether we ask for 5,000 or 10,000, like if we're asking, we got to do the value. If we ask for five, we can just, you know, do less.

19:00 - Chris Andrade
But they don't know who we are yet. Other than having a phone call, right? They got to meet us. They don't know who the Arise group is. They don't know what we do, who we are. We still have it. They only know that through me. You know what I mean? Yeah.

19:16 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
And I mean, part of me is thinking, like, I don't know how much they really care about that.

19:22 - Chris Andrade
Like, they care about what is the But they deserve the attention to kind of, like, bring that to the table when we're trying to present that dollar value, right? Yeah.

19:38 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
As part of what they're getting out of it, it's like, first, the result for your business is what you're getting. That's what we're selling. And then this is kind of how we're going to do it. And then this is who we are. So, you know, you can trust us. And then here's the offer that we have for you guys to get started. You know, we understand it's, it's, this is the price that we think you guys are willing to go forward with. And, but that's only like, after we've shown them, like, Hey, this is what we're thinking.

20:14 - Chris Andrade
Can I touch on that real quick too, to add value to what you just said? I think it would be very wise for us to not only like, we, the value that the document that we're trying to provide them, right, at the end of the day is clarity, right? And we, if we incorporate why you guys, why, why is this important to you guys? Matt, you, Mikael, Trent, right? What I'm trying to get at is at the end of the day, you're investing in us and we are investing in you because this ultimately is going be something that can be scaled big time. Yeah.

21:26 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
And I think that's, that's a great point. And that's like part of what sold plotter mechanics, I think is like, we're like, like the only way that we have a chance that succeeding as an agency is if we deliver results for you guys, and we can tell other people how we made your business better. So like we can tell SNS at the end of this presentation, like this is what we're thinking, like lead capture, digital sales engine, QR lead capture system, three week implementation timeline, ROI investment, whatever. Or whatever. And then at the end, it's like, look, we have a case study we're building with Plotter Mechanics. That's case study number one. And full transparency, we're working on their stuff too. But case study number two is really going to lock in our future as an agency. So we really want to deliver actual results for you guys. That's why we're starting out with this. And we want to stay in contact with you guys as much as possible. We want to have your input as much as possible. So that we make sure that we're just, we're your transformation partner. We're not just here to take $10,000 and not give you nothing and leave. like what they need you guys do like straight up at the end of the day.

22:44 - Chris Andrade
That's the, that's the close right there at the end of the day.

22:50 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Yep. That's all we're missing, bro.

22:53 - Chris Andrade
So let's take a look at the gamma. I'm just curious now. That's, that's, that's honestly, man, that's what we're missing, right? Yeah, cool.

23:03 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
So, okay, so we'll figure out where to fit that in, but I think probably towards the end, probably right at the end, actually, if it's a close, but yeah. So digital sales engine for Shed Dealerships, you can't see it? Oh, killing me, killing me. Yeah, exactly. I love that movie, by the way. Oh, man.

23:30 - Chris Andrade
Full time.

23:33 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
So... It goes out your screen again.

23:35 - Chris Andrade
It says test out Trent's theory. Hit that X. Okay.

23:40 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Good, bro, you're live.

23:42 - Chris Andrade
I got you.

23:44 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
All right, might as well go presentation mode. Okay, so here's where we can kind of talk about stuff. Like, definitely, this has got to go on the next line, but whatever. And we want to say SNS Wolfsheds, S&S Wolf Sheds Premier Shed Dealership. But I love this graphic right here because it's dashboard and all the sheds. Oh, I didn't even see that. There's QR codes with each one, bro. That's crazy. Oh, god damn, bro.

24:15 - Chris Andrade
We need to zoom that in. It's so far out. Exactly. That needs to get zoomed in. And then that digital, I feel like the digital needs to be small. That needs to be flipped, for reals. And then, I would like to throw in their logo, their new logo. my God, about their new logo. Oh, it's gonna be so sick.

24:38 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Sweet, dude. Yeah, that sounds You can see the same colors, too, if I'm being honest.

24:44 - Chris Andrade
So, yeah, bro.

24:46 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Okay, cool. And then, so transform your physical lot into a powerful digital sales engine that captures every opportunity.

24:55 - Chris Andrade
Just so you know. Oh, sorry, I didn't hear it. We're just... I didn't realize that it is a dashboard with hyperlinks on each building, dude. That's so cool. That's so cool.

25:09 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
It is. McHale made that or Gamma made it.

25:12 - Chris Andrade
I wish that he was here. He'll hear the thing, but I guess I wish there was a way that like, bro, if there's a way that I can create, you know, when you drop a little person from Google map and you drop him in on a road. I wish I can be dropped and I'm staring at that board and I'm looking around the lot and I'm seeing all those hyperlinks as I look like a augmented reality type situation. Well, like, yeah, but like legit, like if there was a way for we like, this is how it started. And then we saw this and then I just visually just drop myself. Okay. So. I my screen. Like, you know where it says Lee Cooper, right?

26:05 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
I can't see your screen now.

26:07 - Chris Andrade
Oh, no, but it's fine. It's him being just dropped right in front of that whiteboard, right in the middle, right? And now he sees this board, and you can see all these hyperlinks on these buildings, like something like that. That would be so freaking cool.

26:25 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Yeah, and are you talking about like a video, some type of video we show them, or like?

26:30 - Chris Andrade
Honestly, I mean, how hard, how complicated is it to get a video just to create some sort of visual, like to get them to see that? Bro, it's literally just what you just described.

26:46 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
We just pull it out of the transcript, and we send it to VAO3. That's why I try to be descriptive.

26:51 - Chris Andrade
Like, yeah, like, Google Maps dropped me right in front of this board, and then I just want to just look. IANCY difficult thatазыв And as I look to the left, I see the office, and I look to the right, and I see all the buildings in this big old beautiful dealership that's outside in the Sonoran Desert, in the high desert, and in Tuba City, and see these hyperlinks that gives me all the information to their pricing. And opportunities for sales coming up. Yeah, and like, which one has a discount?

27:36 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Like, does this one have a discount? Yeah.

27:39 - Chris Andrade
Oh, which one's on sale right now? I think I can get away for an extra two feet for an extra hundred bucks. Yeah. And then, and then be like, so this would be like now, right? Like, that's what we can do right now with this $5,000, right? thank you. Thank You And because at the end of the day, that's exactly what we're doing. We're draining hyperlinks, putting it on a spreadsheet, right? Boom. And then the future, right? Where then now, the delivery, after the sign of the contract, after they close, right? After they make the close and they say, thank you for coming by our dealership and buying your billing with us, your portfolio will be updated, your profile will be updated. Make sure you send this to your driver when they show up, or when they call you to schedule your delivery. And make sure you put all your maps and all the information. And if you need tree trimmings or anything like that, if you need somebody to make a fence or whatever, just put it in there. We'll get you taken care of.

28:57 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Yeah. So that's, we'll get that right when they

29:00 - Chris Andrade
Yeah, I mean, at the end of the day, that's what the portfolio is going to be, the profile is going to have that where they can put all that maps and all those pictures and get all those requests to look for contractors to do these crazy jobs that come in, I need to build a road from here, oh , yeah, you good? No, because I literally, this lady needs to build a road from the highway to her property, and I haven't gone back to her. I got you. Keep going. So what's the next slide look like?

29:52 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Sorry, yeah, Google Meet just freaking cut me off again for some reason, but this, so the. Yeah. We went over the first slide, and then this is the second slide, so first they see this, second slide is lead leakage, visitors walking away uncaptured, so everything you just talked about is how you're going to capture those leads, even if they don't want to shed today, and you're telling them all that stuff about handling their other needs, you might walk away, you might capture revenue just from referring them to somebody about something else, or maybe it's part of the whole shed process, right, more likely. So the problem, the challenge, you can still hear me, right? Yes, I got you. I'm letting you run.

30:45 - Chris Andrade
I like it. Cool, cool.

30:47 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Okay, so every day potential customers visit your lot, browse sheds, and leave without you capturing their information. These missed opportunities represent significant lost revenue. Additional methods failed to capture leads at the critical moment of interest, resulting in dispersed opportunities that never convert. So 70% lost leads, visitors leave without contact info. And I think we can update this slide to talk about...

31:16 - Chris Andrade
Is there a way to turn that text into a chart? Yeah. Let's create a prompt that just instead of reading it, I want to see it. Bro, let's see it. And then have a little quick little one-line banger underneath it. You know what saying? Damn, you're making me believe I haven't eaten, bro. Keep going. Actually, hold on. Can I go see if I got something real quick? Hold on. Go get it.

31:58 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Don't we'll DEMON w

32:11 - Chris Andrade
Thank you. Thank you. We're almost there. you. I was going to ask, do they look weird? If not, I'll still- You know, I would, earlier down when you do it, I love my wife, she's the best, I love it, okay, so, oh, your screen's not sharing, here, let me pull it up, on my end, so you don't have to keep us, let me, quit being lazy, sorry, I know you had that, that was on my Slack channel, bro, hey, this is a side note, let's put this on a wish list, agenda, note taker, can we add this somehow, down the road, your app creating opportunities, your time that you get for creating apps, that's easy. Okay, for me?

34:59 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
I mean, a record.

35:00 - Chris Andrade
West, if there's a way that I can plug my WhatsApp, my Slack channel, really just and my emails, if I can plug those three in to some sort of agent that can notify me in real time of my current situation. So, if I don't check in from 7am, and then I don't have a moment to look at all of them until 2.30, because this is what's happening, is that because there's so much happening from the time blocks, right, and they're on all these different channels, and then I have to spend time to figure out, and because I still haven't connected this thing to my Notion or my Slack channel, So, I can just figure out a way to go to . One assistant to be like, hey, no, this is what should happen from 7-20 to now. And it can be like, play-by-play, oh, yeah, you need to get over here, like, soon, because they're waiting for you there. So as soon as you can look at this gamma, the faster the guys can move. Can you do this like that? You know what I'm saying? Yeah, do.

36:25 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
I know exactly what you're saying, bro. And so would it be cool if that thing would, like, reach out to you proactively? Like, it would just be like a brain, it's connected to everything, and it knows everything, and it just reaches out to you?

36:37 - Chris Andrade
On WhatsApp, look on Kelsey, look at what he just posted. He got himself on new, like, he got a new client, and he, like, looks like he's next to a printer or something? What is that? Dang, that would be really cool to post right now on social media. You should push that to your LinkedIn. Yeah, bro.

36:55 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
So do you, Chris, do you have, like... I know you said you might have like an extra laptop or something.

37:04 - Chris Andrade
you have like an extra laptop later on? Dude, check this out, bro. Hold on. I've been waiting to show you this. Hold on. Man, hold on. Did you send this meeting to WhatsApp? What? Did you send this meeting to WhatsApp, right?

37:23 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Yeah, the meeting link? Yeah. Here directly on WhatsApp.

37:27 - Chris Andrade
I don't need to go off track, but you have to see this . Okay, I'm going mute this one. Mute it.

37:37 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
I'm just throwing food. I'm about to throw some food in and then it's all good. Should I admit?

37:49 - Chris A
Okay. Check this out. Let me turn my camera on. You You understand. I don't know that's There we go. Can you see this? So this is my computer, right? This is how I talk, right?

38:08 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Yeah, all right. I have this.

38:12 - Chris A
Two. Holy .

38:14 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Wait, wait, wait, wait. Hold on, bro. Hold on. Wait. Wait. Then I have this. Mac, right? Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

38:25 - Chris A
Hold on. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Wait. I have this precision.

38:34 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
. Okay. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, Seven monitors? Seven monitors.

38:49 - Chris A
You see what I'm looking at here? Look what I did.

38:53 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
I have no idea. I see lights. Is it a CPU? So this is.

39:00 - Chris A
Mike, this is my main computer, right here. Okay. Yeah.

39:04 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Sweet. See this?

39:06 - Chris A
I put it on my old longboard. I built this shelf for my longboard. And that's my Precision. The CinderBlox Dell?

39:17 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Dell Precision? Yeah. That's this computer. Wow. That's so sick, dude. Sony monitors, bro.

39:28 - Chris A
Bro, my efficiency, this is what I'm trying to say. Like, I am cooking over here. Yeah. Dude, Kenny came over. My buddy Kenny came over. Yeah. He's like, how the ? What? He was mind blown. Because he saw us meeting, and he saw our office and . And he's like, what the are you doing, dude? He's like, bro. I'm so proud of you right now.

39:58 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
I can right, I can go. Yeah. Yeah. It was the coolest moment, bro.

40:04 - Chris Andrade
It was the coolest moment. He's like, I'm just so happy that I answered your call. was like, damn. He's like, you know, he's in a rough spot too. And I gave him energy, man. He's like, dude, I just want to know that I love you, bro. I appreciate you. And he's like, you always just been crazy. And I see now why. I got this. Like, this is how I own. The only way I know how to explain is I have this, this true north, like this, this call, this feel, this guide, just whatever path or whatever obstacle is in my way, I just go north. Boom. That's it. There's no other question. And I really truly feel like Matthew. I really found mine. Now it's not, now I know where I was going. Now I have this picture of like, oh, I just got to go like this and paint it now.

41:10 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

41:12 - Chris Andrade
And now, so like what we're doing here. So yeah, this is what we need to do for them, right? And so this, I love this dictation of it. If we can just create some sort of, like, again, to go back to what... So, hold on.

41:28 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Real quick, before we get back on track, I wanted to say, I think there's something that if you have a computer that is, like, not really doing something, or you could move the operations of it to something else. I know they're probably all doing something, though. So, but I was wondering if you have an extra one.

41:49 - Chris Andrade
No, not so that's, so I literally started a conversation today with Claude, because I'm connecting my mics to my computer, then from... So each computer is going to have its job. So this computer, I plan for my construction stuff. So that all my construction, all that stuff lives in there, right? And Mac is like my note taker, my messenger, my personal stuff, right? And that's my demo. That's why I want to install that cloud code and my visual on my demo on my laptop on the Precision. Two, just to be put some demos on in front of people as well. Demos, okay.

42:38 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Is there one that you, so... But I have another laptop too that I can dedicate.

42:44 - Chris Andrade
I just haven't used it yet.

42:46 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Oh, you have an unused one? Mm-hmm. Okay, because, so something that's been apparently sweeping the nation over this weekend is, might just be exactly the thing that... That can like connect to things and reach out to you and it's like its own brain and you can you can literally like chat with it like you can send it messages from through whatsapp or like through like a computer to be my assistant yeah that's this one that's what I want this one to be yeah okay which one which one and it already has my my my Remus one the construction one but this is the one I already have visual studios and I already have the quad environment installed that one this one's ready to go okay okay so yeah maybe maybe it is that one but basically like I think we should get you set up with it because it needs to be a beefy computer where the system requirements or something like that I don't yeah I don't know I think think um

44:00 - Chris Andrade
This one's built for it, bro. This has an i9 with a GTX 490 with 32 gigs. So this thing's ready. I was trying to get another computer for CAD and stuff. That's why I got this one. Right.

44:22 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
I don't know if it uses a lot of the compute power of the actual computer, because mostly Claude is doing it.

44:30 - Chris Andrade
I put this computer to devote to a project like that. So that's what this is for. Because I want this to communicate to all my other stuff. Okay.

44:42 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Yeah, bro. I think you should get... So Claude bought... I saw that this morning.

44:50 - Chris Andrade
That's what you guys were talking about. And he ran through the whole install. So I want to run that install on here. Yeah, think so.

44:58 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
But like, so... Trent was kind of like he put on his computer that he's not that is like not like he's trying to silo it off because it's pretty autonomous. So it can just go do stuff. So he doesn't want to cause havoc by being like, kind of like on a computer that he uses all the time. So then maybe I don't.

45:19 - Chris Andrade
Okay, I got you. I got you. Do you know what's funny? I have this. You know, you know what a Raspberry Pi is, right? Yeah, yeah.

45:34 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Check this out.

45:37 - Chris Andrade
I got a little computer built right here, bro.

45:40 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Yeah, I've seen videos about people, I think putting a cloud bot on one of those are like AI local model and one of those. I don't know the spec situation or how you're going to interface. Well, got you got Yeah, but

46:00 - Chris Andrade
It's been a long time, bro. I messed around with this thing. But I'm pretty sure the operating system is still on this.

46:08 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Okay.

46:09 - Chris Andrade
But no, this is all through Linux, I believe. No, there was Windows. I don't remember what was installed. Ubuntu? Man, it's been a long time. Okay. Adam, I'm pretty sure. So, if I remember right, yeah, Arduino had their own little script, actually. Now I'm thinking about it. Yeah, Arduino had their own little script that you got. Anyways, but I mean, listen, I would love to do that. I think it's something that would be very helpful for not only me, but us as a group to have something like that. And then I think for you, you can get paid to develop the bones for it.

46:55 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Yeah, I mean, or like the training, so that like... Maybe we do a session with Trent as well, because he already set up for him. I don't know at what point, but I'm thinking as a retrospective on the last couple weeks or whatever, and the problem that we just talked about is you keep getting pulled into stuff, and there's all these urgent things that come up because it's just like, oh, , I should have done that or whatever. And, like, if this bot can kind of, like, tell you a bit ahead of time, a bit in advance, or, like, so you can plan your day around it, like, potentially that can actually make a difference in your life.

47:43 - Chris Andrade
That's why I've been thinking about it, and then I don't know what happened today. I think it was when we were talking about it because of how Notion is and how Slack is used. And then I realized, once I opened up my Slack channel, how much information I missed. And because we've been looking at WhatsApp, we've been talking on, you know what I mean? And it's like, it's just, and then I get emails that get sent and I don't realize the emails are in there. So it's just one thing after another.

48:16 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
So the setup of that CloudBot thing is like, you just connect it to everything. And then what Trent has done is like, he has, he asked it, like, can you just put together a daily report for me that I, and you send it to Every day at 8 a.m.

48:34 - Chris Andrade
Damn. Oh, here it is. You know what? I'm gonna . I don't care. This is literally a brand new laptop that I have nothing, you know, like nothing, nothing to do on. This is for Remus development because I was the IT guy. I had a feeling you might have one of those.

48:54 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Like, it's so funny to me. You're just like pulling out a laptop and a Raspberry Pi and like eight monitors.

49:02 - Chris Andrade
My buddy walked in and he's like, what the are you doing, dude? I'm like, I don't know.

49:10 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
I'm just figuring it out as I go.

49:15 - Chris Andrade
Okay, let's go back to SNS. Let's knock this out. Okay, let's do it. Yeah.

49:20 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
You want to share a screen or should I do it?

49:24 - Chris Andrade
I was finding that's where we got sidetracked because you're right. It is something that is needed. It would help a lot of our daily day. So I'm going to go ahead. Am I am sharing my screen, right? I can't see right now. I'm sorry. There you go. Okay, so yes, let's zoom this in a little bit. Wait, you're note takers on here, right? Yeah, I hope so. mind's on. much. Yours is gone, too?

50:03 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Yeah, mine is gone, thankfully.

50:05 - Chris Andrade
Let me write this down, because I figured S and S. Is that?

50:17 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Okay, that's changing the name of the Fireflies title?

50:22 - Chris Andrade
Yeah, in the extension that gets sent to Google Drive. So this one gets sent to Google Drive. This, the other one that is in the meeting rooms gets sent to Fireflies. Okay.

50:41 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
All right.

50:43 - Chris Andrade
So, okay, so we have this one. Wait, where'd it go? Whoops. I guess it would. What is this digital? Oh, this is Gamma. Sorry. Okay, so can you see my screen again? Yeah. Digital Sales Engine Capture Process Notified. You are a central process automated data organization and routine. my dashboard. Okay, so what do you think? There's a way to visualize the dashboard. Like, I like this, right? Yeah. The central process seems confusing. I don't understand what that means. I think that needs to be eliminated and just go to this lead capture to this dashboard. Or you lead to instant alert to live dashboard. That's it. And then have a real cool, like, maybe an intro to what that, like, did I show you? Hold on, let me... Hey, what's this? Oh, yeah. I forgot about this. Yeah, what is that? I've made this storyboard on how they started.

52:50 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Oh.

52:53 - Chris Andrade
This is when I was trying to... This is when I spent those hours that whole day before the meeting. you. Thank you.

53:01 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Oh, yeah. Okay.

53:08 - Chris Andrade
Man, I need to, let me save this and sit. Where should I, can I move? Where should I go? Let's move this right here. So, I need, let add this to my to-do list. I need to go through and organize my drive. So now, you can still see my camera? I think. Huh?

53:40 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
I think Notion is going to be a good play. I think they paid for Notion now. I think.

53:46 - Chris Andrade
Oh, Mikael did pull the trigger. He did both pay for that?

53:49 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Yeah, I think that's what they jumped to go do, because I just pulled up Notion. I don't see the two days left thing anymore. Okay, cool.

53:56 - Chris Andrade
That's good. Okay, so damn, now I definitely want to start using line. I really depend on that, dude, because that's why I wanted to have these couple computers around me, because if I can have Notion just sitting on one, or Slack on the other, and then have my desktop to do my thing, and they're just constantly going, I feel like it'd be really nice, you know what mean? Where I can sit on top of stuff, that's why I made this arrangement, ultimately, because it's nice to have my stationary computers where all my information is just coming to where I can just glance and look real quick, but then have my workstation that I don't really need to, so I started breaking it up, like I have, like, plotter review, right, my walkout when I need to have my ideas, or when we have meetings pop up, I have all that information right here, and then my source of truth, what, my main desktop, where we, where I mainly work out of. Cool. Oh, cool. All right. So, my fault. Again, I think this is why I know where it was. See, I created this, but I never implemented it. So I think you were looking for something related to. Oh, I wanted to show you the. I know I just saw it. Where is SNS? I just saw it. Yeah, where the is SNS at?

55:34 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
The logo, or? Yeah, have you seen the logo?

55:39 - Chris Andrade
Or what are you looking for right now? Yeah, I just wanted to show you, like, where the logos and stuff were, but I can't show it right now. But you know what I was trying to get at is, like, go have their logo, like, have, like, their logo with that banner, what it would look like, right? Yep. To cut down to, like, what this dash. What does an instant alert look like when they're in the dealership and they're in their office? Create a story of that. Somebody comes in, they scan this link, they go to this dashboard, and then you're sitting in your office and you just get notified that somebody pulled up or somebody just parked their car and they just scanned the link. Who is it? So what do they use right now?

56:32 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Do they use anything like WhatsApp? Nothing. Do they get notifications about anything? Other than Gmail?

56:43 - Chris Andrade
This is their only source of truth, dude. This is their only way.

56:50 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
I was thinking like we could install an app on all their phones, but... is language. You If It might be a bit clunky, and it's not- have dedicated office phones, like iPhones, so that's definitely doable. Yeah, we could, I mean, I've got a lot of the app built out, but like, but I was thinking today, like if, especially on that networking call, it was like, well, you know, they already have Microsoft Teams, like a lot of the big companies. So I was thinking like, if SNS, if we get a good picture of what the SNS uses, like Katrina was saying a lot of small companies use Google Suite. And I know that SNS uses Google Sheets. So maybe the notification is an email that comes in and they can just set up, like maybe it's as simple as that. We just set up an automation that's like, the QR code just goes to, it takes them to SNS, a special page that captures the lead through a special page. And then whenever it's captured.

57:59 - Chris Andrade
And

58:00 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
It just triggers a Gmail notification, and they get a notification through Gmail.

58:06 - Chris Andrade
Dude, that would be freaking beautiful. Oh, yes, I do have it. I don't know. I was like, I swear I have. Okay, so check this out. Look at this, dude. Oh, this is the one I built a long time ago. This is old. This is ancient. . Wow. Matthew, dude, that's my boy. Yeah, Matthew. Let's go. Oh, damn it. Represent. Oh, damn it. Okay, at least you got this.

58:42 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
It was the access or something?

58:46 - Chris Andrade
No, he had this all encrypted. He had this all offline. He built the, he took a long time to build this dude. Like, this is some really crazy . I forgot what this means. things. I forgot what this means. So, and then there's multiple pages, though. That's cool.

59:09 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Yeah.

59:10 - Chris Andrade
Is there anything we can do with this to enhance our proposal, you think? Hell yeah, dude.

59:17 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Like, what? Like, what could we do? I was gonna say... Well, we already have a lot of concepts and ideas and, like, we can feed those to Cloud and feed this CSV to Cloud and be like, hey, how can we utilize this type of data to build out our vision? And then it's gonna spit out something amazing. You see how they already do this, Matthew?

59:50 - Chris Andrade
See this? Number 40, number 29, number 18. These are the numbers that was... so, memoriesになused, Steven, all do the vitesse The hyperlink. This is the hyperlink. Number 29, hyperlink kit. Number 1, hyperlink kit. Number 38, hyperlink kit.

1:00:13 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Okay. And is there, so that's a naming scheme. Do we have like a SOP on how they create the name? Oh, so that's all up in here.

1:00:27 - Chris Andrade
So while I, oh, why, wait, where did this? Oh, hey, sweetheart. Say what? I'm going tie my hands. I'm going to tie your hands. What the heck? What the heck are you trying to show Matthew over here? Why are you going to tie your hands, you crazy girl? Me. What, are you probably playing cops or something? Huh? Are you playing police officers? Yeah. Oh my goodness. I'm not, I'm, you're crazy. crazy. Okay, sorry, sorry. His name's Matthew. Okay, sorry. Mama better not get mad at me. If I did, it's your fault.
ACTION ITEM: Create Drive folder for SNS assets; upload new logo, naming SOP, CSV, storyboard; share link in Slack - WATCH: https://fathom.video/share/uKjUsmGq-5yXsyRthxXsUZJKMEmRUbPU?timestamp=3685.9999 Okay. Oh, no. Go show Mama. Go show Mama. She looked at it better than I did. I love it. Sorry, what were you saying?
ACTION ITEM: Update SNS proposal: simplify flow, add desert visuals, add Clerk, add ROI; share in Slack - WATCH: https://fathom.video/share/uKjUsmGq-5yXsyRthxXsUZJKMEmRUbPU?timestamp=3698.9999

1:01:36 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
I don't remember, but, oh, just, like, basically, let's feed this to Claude. But let's get all these documents in, like, a Google Drive folder and just put that in the Slack channel. And we can, we're going to, let's, we're going to incorporate the transcript from this meeting and edit and update that gamma. go. Let's Like we can probably have that done by like by tonight and then also just any documents that are going to be useful. I know you already sent us workbook one, but like maybe like a new folder that's just some of the stuff that you mentioned, like the new logo we're going to need.

1:02:24 - Chris Andrade
So, yeah, I'm pretty sure I already said that I'll double check so I'll create an action item list from this recording just create all the stuff I need to get done. Where's that the arise group one? The, one, I put a, I made a folder in here for Matthew to put this in, he was supposed to put this in here, but he did it. So, yeah. So, So, This is their Google Drive.

1:03:14 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Hey, bro. Sorry, my computer just does not like me right now.

1:03:32 - Chris Andrade
Oh, dude. What is this?

1:03:35 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
I forgot I built this, dude. What is it? These are our buildings. Wow.

1:03:51 - Chris Andrade
These are all our buildings, all our options, and here are all our colors. Oh, you know what? I think Matthew did this one. I'm pretty sure. Yep. This is what he did. So I asked him to go through. So, dude, wow, this is so good. Yeah.

1:04:09 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Nice.

1:04:12 - Chris Andrade
So then I'm going to come in here. Oh, okay. All right. So do we want to keep going over? Yeah, let's keep going. Let's keep going over this. Cause I'd like to get, whoops.

1:04:31 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
I want to know all the data, all the documents like that you can get us. Like we can refine like what we can build for them. But yeah, I guess let's let's go through.

1:04:44 - Chris Andrade
I have not yet. Again, this is me being too freaking busy. Oh, going through. Where is my meeting at, Matthew? I can't find you, dog. There you are. no. that was a great Yeah. Yeah. Cool. Cool. you. Oh, and then I'm going to be here. Yes, I think that's where we got for it. I think it would just be cool to see that right here, you know what I mean, to get to that dashboard, to load the system. Okay. it works. I mean, if we do, we can do this, combine these two together with that. You know what I'm saying? Well, I know what you're saying, but the note taker doesn't know what you're saying. Oh, so digital sales engine and capture process with these four, we want to, we're going to remove the central processing and just keep the QR. And then we're going to change it to the instant alerts, right, that follow the QR that we get instantly alerted at the office through our dashboard while they're sitting in their office waiting for them. Right. Then would it, so, well, we can picture. We can picture that, I think, with the storyboard, right, like we can do what we're talking about, how that story looks like here, and then we talked about the story of somebody sitting at the dealership, and they're doing paperwork, and we hear a dean come across their desk at the dealership. Another thing we probably want to capture is maybe add a little bit more of a Sonoran desert vibe, right, high desert vibe, right, to actually put that in the picture, in the presentation, right? But yeah, simple form appears, boom, boom, boom, data flow to system, entry to your, yeah, you know, like can we make an illustration to that, you know what I mean?

1:06:51 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
To what, to the QR code lead capture system?

1:06:55 - Chris Andrade
Yeah, yeah, like, I think we can do this. And the digital sales engine and the QR capture lead system, figure out a way to merge both those together. Okay. Yeah.

1:07:09 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Do like a storyboard or like a visual walkthrough of how it works. Right. Right.
ACTION ITEM: Define Phase 1 scope (QR→Sheet→Gmail→Dashboard); align w/ Trent; update timeline - WATCH: https://fathom.video/share/uKjUsmGq-5yXsyRthxXsUZJKMEmRUbPU?timestamp=4034.9999

1:07:15 - Chris Andrade
And then the three-week implementation timeline, week one discovery, week reviews, week two, build and deploy.

1:07:25 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
So I have a question about this, because it seems like what we want to do is more like move that build and deploy thing up to week one. And then I don't know about if we'll have the dashboard ready in phase one. We may, we might be able to, I don't know, but I don't know what we're thinking. Like, do we want us to set up foundation?

1:07:45 - Chris Andrade
That's I think for you and Trent to decide, right, if the dashboard is feasible by week three. If not, then maybe, maybe we can hold off or maybe that can be a part of the second phase. So now we gave them a tool that needs an SOP. So that's why we need to go into our interviewing process. Because now we've got to integrate this dashboard and make sure it's being utilized correctly in all your systems. yeah i think we start with like if we start with a simple enough dashboard we can do it phase one like if it's just very simple like okay like this many qr codes got scanned today right boom like oh you know what i mean like just get like a health like uh like just like organ we'll call it the organic health organic lead health monitor and just start there and this is what we're gonna get you're gonna just be able to say hey you are now organically capturing this many more leaves than you were This time last year, right? Or months ago, right? So now you're ready to capture more leads. Now you can reach out to more people for sales. You know what I mean? And then now you're able to generate your own database to reference and have some sort of idea of how to like calculate ad spends to generate more leads. Yeah, yeah.

1:09:32 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
And like, we can deliver that incrementally. So it's like the first step is, you know, we, we deliver, we promise that we're going to deliver the simple dashboard. And then we over deliver on that promise. We, we get like, the one graph up there. And then any more data we can just plug in, we just pile on the value, we just deliver more. And then we're like, okay, like, like now. So, like, one thing at a time, though, like, one or two things at a time, make sure that they, it's actually useful. We're not just doing random stuff. And then we, like, once we have started to deliver these, like, QR code to lead capture to Gmail notification, simple. First, then we build out. Hold on, bro.

1:10:27 - Chris Andrade
Don't yell at me, okay? Don't yell at me, please.

1:10:30 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
I don't need to be yelled at. Okay.

1:10:35 - Chris Andrade
No, I, uh, sorry. Yeah, I was saying, Mr. DuMass, please don't yell at me. Do it for that, son of a . . Yeah, okay. I was trying to solve your other problem, sir, okay? And I got the idea about you trying to figure out how big that hole in the ground is that you need to fill. these nons, doesn't matter. Body Oh, yeah, so I got you. I need an email so I can send you the plans. Oh, gotcha. Okay. Did you talk to your buddy? Is he going to help us? Yeah, yeah, yeah. He's on board. But actually, hey, Matthew, hold on. I'm going to have to turn my fireflies on. The other side will be here. Real quick, can you... Hey, Mr. DeMoss, can you give me a real quick description of exactly what you need on that for, like, what the deliverables that you are requiring in order to justify the cost for me to go out there and fly the drone? Well, I'm to give you the plan so you'll have the existing topo. you, you Thank Okay, got it. And so on the back end, the way the report, have you ever seen like a 3D report or like the quantities or calculations? Have you ever got them? Okay, you have seen that? Okay, cool. Yeah. Okay. So I am going to get, I'm sending you my, texting you my email right now. And then, yeah, send me those plans and then I'll send you the, I need to send you the plans for Shaw Butte too, right? Oh, yeah, yeah. Okay, cool. I'll send that to you right away, sir. Okay. All right. So you're going to text me your email? Yep. I just switched to iPhone. Otherwise, I would be doing it right now. email. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. I'm still figuring this fucker out. That's all the way to go, dude. No, I'm surprised to hear you say that. I'm it's, yeah, it's all right. It's, it's fine. It's cool. I appreciate it. But I'll, I'll, I'll talk to you soon. Thank you. Dude. You don't understand to be able to talk to that guy the way, like, it is a privilege to even, and for him to give me a moment, he does not give two bucks about anybody, and he will tell you in front of your face.

1:13:39 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Yeah.

1:13:43 - Chris Andrade
Sorry. I got to text him real quick. Yeah. Otherwise he's going to yell at me again.

1:13:49 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Chris. Do it, bro. At the polygy.com. Okay.

1:14:04 - Chris Andrade
All right. So now timeline. Yeah, we got it. I think we shared revise that. And I think we started out with like the 5000 for just the implement the QR to the Excel spreadsheet. And I think you talked about maybe an email notification and hopefully a dashboard, right? Maybe, maybe not. Well, you guys depend. then then I think we just stick to that for the first three weeks, maybe two weeks. Hopefully we can get it done in two weeks.

1:14:44 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Yeah. Yeah. If we promise. I mean, I kind of think we're going to be able to. So we're going to under promise and over deliver. So I think we're going to be able to implement some stuff pretty quickly and and like have it. Ready, I guess we'll need to spend some time testing. And then do we want to do interviews?

1:15:06 - Chris Andrade
don't mean to interrupt you, but I need the task taker, the note taker to note that I, Chris, need to start working on the platform, the placard that the hyperlink needs to get on, right? Because ultimately that's, because as soon as we get the hyperlink system established, then I need to go and start testing it and implementing it in real time, right? That's ultimately going to be the next holdup.

1:15:35 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Yeah, I mean, the first, the first step is going to be printing QR codes, printing different QR codes that are dynamic QR codes. So we're going to set up, that'll be part of our deliverables and setting, and I know how to do that. So you, it's pretty simple to, you just, you can ask Claude too, like how, how do I create a dynamic QR code? I've done it on qrcodegenerator.com. And then basically, we got to print those out, get them laminated. And then I think later you can upgrade like it to the placard, unless you want to do it right away. course, it's up to you. But I'm just saying like, QR code itself is the foundation. And then we're going to build out the mapping. And then that's going to help us to customize that email notification that gets sent to the lot people. And then it's going to be able to say like, okay, like this, like somebody scan like the very, very basic one is somebody scan this QR code. Like, it's the part about keeping track of one person scanned three buildings is a bit more complicated than just the the bare bones. I don't think we need to offer that stage.

1:17:05 - Chris Andrade
think that's an iteration. That's like an add-on, right? I'm just saying for just stage one, we're just trying to get their initial information to be put onto a spreadsheet and to say, hey, you got an email notification. Say, hey, you got a new lead that came into this lot. Because then that will create a tally marker for how many times the dealership, like, my mom will be able to see, like, damn, each dealership. Like, I got a dashboard to see how many people are doing it. Like, that will bring value along. You know what I mean?

1:17:40 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Yeah. So what about, like, so, because it's going to be kind of annoying if they have to enter their information each time, each time they scan a QR code. I'm thinking, I wonder how easy it'll be to set up, like, login on SS Wolfshed's website, like, customer-like.

1:18:06 - Chris Andrade
I think if we do that, I have that server space just sitting there, just waiting for it to be used.

1:18:14 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Yeah, I mean, I've done it on my Infinity Ball website. Like if there's like a, we can just hook up clerk and basically that way, like if they scan the QR code, if they're already logged in on the website, then the next QR code they scan, they're not going to have to give their information again. And like, even if we don't give them like a custom experience in phase one, we'll at least be able to track per customer, like, hey, like they've scanned two today or three. So that would be cool. And then on the back end, eventually we can hook up like, okay, the lot attendant can see this customer profile just scanned a couple today. Dude.

1:19:00 - Chris Andrade
So that will sell in and of its own Yeah, customer profile.

1:19:09 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, because it's obvious what you can build more stuff after that, like a whole thing. Dude, maybe.

1:19:19 - Chris Andrade
And then when they build a profile, where does their phone number go?

1:19:31 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
So I can share my screen and show you real quick. It's just a service provider. It's called Clerk. So like you go to infinity vault cards, there's this is my e-commerce website and you can do sign in and then you can sign in with Google. By the way, you can do like three different ones. You can do up to three different types of sign in. But Google is a simple. You can sign in with your phone number. It makes it easy. then if I sign in, then now I have this little thing. says my name. It has my Google thing right here. And then all the stuff on the site can be customized now to that user. And where it's managed is this site called clerk.com. So this thing, more than complete user management. So it's building, you can build for free. They don't charge you anything really until you have like 10,000 users. So for SNS, would probably be free for like forever. Potentially. I mean, until, you know, until they really build. Follow up. Good problem to have. That's for sure. Yeah. Like, Oh, now they're gonna charge me 50 bucks a month. Now that I'm making millions.

1:21:03 - Chris Andrade
So this will give SNS the ability to plug in a profile for the website right away? Yeah, like very quickly.
ACTION ITEM: Research Clerk on WordPress for SNS; report back - WATCH: https://fathom.video/share/uKjUsmGq-5yXsyRthxXsUZJKMEmRUbPU?timestamp=4873.9999

1:21:15 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
It should be very quick. I've never done it on, is it, it's WordPress, right? So that, I'm sure there's gotta be a way, probably a way.

1:21:24 - Chris Andrade
Do you want to, let's just add that to the list to do research for is, is, let's look into that. Yeah. it's already 530 and my daughters are going to be wanting to get to bed here pretty soon. So let's, let's finish this out real quick. Holy , dude.

1:21:45 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
I didn't even know I had all these users on my website. . Really? I haven't looked at this in months, dude. That's so cool.

1:21:52 - Chris Andrade
Yeah, I think we definitely got to sell that, bro. That was selling again. That's like added value times. 10. They're going to lose their mind when you say that. So I guess that answers this implementation. Let's reassess that, right? Investment and ROI, what you get.

1:22:16 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
So should we recap the deliverables real quick? I think this is like the last slide or something. It is the last slide.

1:22:22 - Chris Andrade
Yeah. So all these, if we just focus on capturing the SIF, the lead, right? And let's say if we capture two more leads per day, and let's just say that is 60 leads per month, right? That can turn out of, let's say you think it realistically out of 60 leads that come into that dealership per month, you're converting two. So an average ticket of sale. On two buildings or two sales tickets, it's $8,000, so you just made an extra $16,000 that month because we created this lead funnel capturing device, and that's how we can quantify ROI.

1:23:19 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
How does capturing the leads tie to increased sales? Like, are we reaching out to them after?

1:23:27 - Chris Andrade
Yeah, so we'll go with just the overall consensus. If right now we have no way to capture any leads, right? And let's say we implement this strategy, and from implementing, let's just say we capture one to two more leads a day, right? Mm-hmm. So that's either going to be 30 leads or 60 leads, right, in a month. Yep. And you got got extra. out And out of those 30 or 60 leads, let's say we just make them turn one into a sale. We just make one sale.

1:24:07 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
But how? How does that one person turn into a sale? Like, how does that happen?

1:24:13 - Chris Andrade
Well, the natural process of the buildings, the selling, the services, they want something. Out of those 60, I'm just saying one of them we can convert. And because...

1:24:23 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
But do you have, sorry to interrupt, but do you have existing email campaigns that you're sending out to an email list right now? Or do we build that out as a RISE group?

1:24:36 - Chris Andrade
No, we don't have existing email campaigns. No.

1:24:40 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Okay.

1:24:41 - Chris Andrade
I'm just trying to figure out a way to say that if we, if there's a way that we can say by capturing one more lead organically, by implementing this, this way to, to, like to get people to go to your, uh, If we could just gain one more a day, one more lead by implementing this.

1:25:09 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
So potentially, with that discounted delivery offer, that could be something more than what they're doing right now.

1:25:20 - Chris Andrade
That could be one more lead by just implementing one thing that costs $5,000. And that one thing can potentially, one sale can pay for this because an average sale is $8,000.

1:25:38 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Yeah. And we could set up like a single follow-up email campaign as well. Yeah, exactly. We don't have anything like that. Yeah.

1:25:51 - Chris Andrade
Let's just say one of those, and then you've seen the spreadsheet. We have, let's just say 500, and let's say we convert one out of those. We just made another $8,000.

1:26:04 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Yeah, I really like the idea to keep phase one, like foundational, just this, like all the ideas, but just simple, like, okay, one email campaign follow up. One, like, I mean, capture their email on the website, like just get that foundational QR code stuff. Yeah.

1:26:26 - Chris Andrade
Hey, man, I've really got to go take a leak. I think it's a pretty good stopping point for the moment.

1:26:32 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Yeah.

1:26:33 - Chris Andrade
Come back on. Let me just hang out with the kiddos for a little bit, because I literally have not spent any time with them today. And then I can come back on tonight, but I think this right here, we got a lot to kind of go run on. Yeah, this is exactly what we needed.

1:26:48 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
I think we've, we've got like our phase one deliverables. So I'm gonna let you go. And thank you for taking the time to do this.

1:26:53 - Chris Andrade
And any time, dog, you, you, you, you guys are the only ones that. I can say, Chris, I need to, I need an hour, bro. Chris, like you need to give me an hour. I'd be like, I, I gotta go see ya. Turn my phone off. Straight up. Yeah. And that's on me too.

1:27:11 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
I gotta know that. I gotta know that. Thank you for reminding me and I'll, I'll, I'll do better about doing that too. Yeah.

1:27:18 - Chris Andrade
I mean, at the end of the day, until we have my app or she had my, my, my, I won't call her the B word, my, my lady friend who can be like, Hey, uh, yeah, you just got this guy from Matthew. He's saying that we need to get this gamma reviewed. Like right now. Oh . You know what saying?

1:27:37 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Yeah, I think so. All right.

1:27:40 - Chris Andrade
All right, dude. I'll talk to you later. All right. Have a good evening, brother. You too, Mike. Bye.
