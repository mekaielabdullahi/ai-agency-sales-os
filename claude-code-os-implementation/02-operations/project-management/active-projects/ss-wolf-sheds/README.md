## Core Pain Points

### 1. Lead Volume Collapse (Critical)
- Paused ~$400/month paid ads in October
- Lead volume dropped to ~25% of prior
- Phones stopped ringing
- Both foot traffic and web/phone leads affected

### 2. Website UX/SEO Issues
- Mobile UX problems
- Broken embeds from hosting/migration
- Storage changes causing layout oddities
- Poor "sheds near me" visibility in Northern AZ

### 3. Repetitive Inquiry Time Drain
- Answering same questions repeatedly (pricing, RTO terms, timelines)
- Happens across Facebook and messages
- Info already in listings but customers don't find it

### 4. Delivery/Ops Friction with Graceland
- NetSuite passes minimal info to dealers
- Dispatch texting/call follow-ups failing
- Caused cancellations and irate customers
- Dealers can't communicate directly through system

### 5. Custom Order Build Errors
- ~5-6 errors out of ~40 orders last year
- Door/window sides/swings built incorrectly
- Causes re-builds, 2+ week delays
- High reputational cost (one lost $24k expansion sale)

### 6. Analytics Visibility Gaps
- Uncertain attribution
- Limited understanding of current analytics
- Need better dashboards
- Can't quantify lost opportunities or CAC/ROAS

## Recent Updates (January 20, 2026)

### Phase 1 MVP: Lot Assistant Defined
Technical requirements finalized for digital transformation:

| Component | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **QR Lot Assistant** | On-site lead capture via QR codes on each shed |
| **Giveaway Incentive** | Free mini-shed delivery (~$2.5k value) for Name/Phone |
| **Data-Driven Ads** | Cross-reference 3yr sales data with Meta performance |
| **Man-Hour Factor** | ROI model to quantify efficiency gains |
| **Hub Vision** | Starlink + generator for 24/7 self-sufficient dealerships |

### Key Developments
1. **Lead Capture Focus** - Visitors leave acre-plus lots without engaging; QR codes solve this
2. **Ad Strategy Shift** - From "shotgunning" $400/mo to targeted data-driven campaigns
3. **Graceland Gap Management** - Automated post-sale follow-ups to catch fulfillment issues
4. **Infrastructure Play** - Starlink/power hubs could become revenue stream for other dealers

### Immediate Action Items
- [ ] Draft giveaway lead-gen plan (prize/terms/promo/tracking)
- [ ] Build MVP QR lead form with attendant alerts
- [ ] Define designated parking + signage for lots
- [ ] Document post-contract delivery timeline
- [ ] Evaluate Starlink security trailer hub feasibility
- [ ] Finish man-hour/CX factor model
