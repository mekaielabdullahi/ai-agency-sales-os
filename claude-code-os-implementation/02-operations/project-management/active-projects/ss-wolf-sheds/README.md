## Core Pain Points

### 1. Lead Volume Collapse (Critical)
- Paused ~$400/month paid ads in October
- Lead volume dropped to ~25% of prior
- Phones stopped ringing
- Both foot traffic and web/phone leads affected

### 2. Website UX/SEO Issues
- Mobile UX problems
- Broken embeds from hosting/migration
- Storage changes causing layout oddities
- Poor "sheds near me" visibility in Northern AZ

### 3. Repetitive Inquiry Time Drain
- Answering same questions repeatedly (pricing, RTO terms, timelines)
- Happens across Facebook and messages
- Info already in listings but customers don't find it

### 4. Delivery/Ops Friction with Graceland
- NetSuite passes minimal info to dealers
- Dispatch texting/call follow-ups failing
- Caused cancellations and irate customers
- Dealers can't communicate directly through system

### 5. Custom Order Build Errors
- ~5-6 errors out of ~40 orders last year
- Door/window sides/swings built incorrectly
- Causes re-builds, 2+ week delays
- High reputational cost (one lost $24k expansion sale)

### 6. Analytics Visibility Gaps
- Uncertain attribution
- Limited understanding of current analytics
- Need better dashboards
- Can't quantify lost opportunities or CAC/ROAS
