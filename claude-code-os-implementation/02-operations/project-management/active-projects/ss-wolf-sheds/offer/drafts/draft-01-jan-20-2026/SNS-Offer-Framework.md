# S&S Wolf Sheds Offer Framework
## Digital Sales Engine
### Draft: January 20, 2026

---

## The Problem We're Solving

**S&S Wolf Sheds is leaving money on the table.** Customers drive to your lots, walk around, and leave without anyone knowing they were there. Your $400/month ad spend is "shotgunning" - no targeting, no tracking, no ROI visibility.

**The Core Issues:**
1. **On-Lot Lead Leakage** - Visitors browse acre-plus lots and leave without engaging (no capture mechanism)
2. **Untargeted Ad Spend** - $400/mo Meta ads with no data-driven targeting or ROI tracking
3. **Fulfillment Communication Gaps** - Graceland drops the ball on customer updates, requiring manual intervention
4. **No Customer Intelligence** - 3 years of sales data sitting unused; can't identify ideal customer profile

**What this costs:**
- Every uncaptured lot visitor is a potential $5,000+ sale walking away
- Untargeted ads waste 50%+ of spend on wrong audience
- Graceland communication failures create negative reviews and lost referrals
- No ideal customer data means marketing campaigns are guesses

---

## The Solution: Digital Sales Engine

We're building a system that **captures every visitor, targets the right customers, and automates follow-up** - so SNS can scale from $20k/mo to $50k/mo revenue.

### How SNS Will Make More Sales

| Problem | Solution | Revenue Impact |
|---------|----------|----------------|
| Visitors leave without capture | QR Lot Assistant on every shed | Capture 100% of interested visitors |
| Don't know who to target | Cross-reference 3yr sales data + Meta | Ads hit ideal customers only |
| Wasted ad spend | Data-driven campaigns with ROI tracking | 2-3x return on ad spend |
| Graceland drops ball | Automated post-sale follow-ups | Prevent bad reviews, recover referrals |
| Slow seasons kill revenue | AI-powered proactive marketing | Compensate for lost foot traffic |

---

## The Engagement

**Investment:** $10,000
**Timeline:** 3 weeks
**Structure:** Stakeholder Interviews + Quick Win Deliverables

| Week | Focus | Deliverables |
|------|-------|--------------|
| **Week 1** | Discovery & Foundation | Stakeholder interviews, sales data analysis, giveaway campaign plan |
| **Week 2** | Build & Deploy | QR lead capture system live, designated parking signage, lead tracking |
| **Week 3** | Intelligence & Follow-Up | Customer follow-up system, data-driven ad strategy ready for March |

---

## Week 1: Discovery & Foundation

### Stakeholder Interviews

Validate assumptions and fill data gaps with structured interviews:

| Stakeholder | Duration | What We Learn |
|-------------|----------|---------------|
| **Sandy** | 30 min | Revenue, pricing, lead flow, close rate, customer profile |
| **Matthew** | 20 min | Operating costs, lot operations, time tracking |
| **Chris A** | 20 min | Operational insights, expansion plans, accountability needs |

**Output:** Validated baseline metrics, confirmed pain points, prioritized opportunities

### Sales Data Analysis

Review 3 years of historical sales to identify patterns:

- Which sheds sell best?
- Which customers buy multiple?
- What's the seasonal pattern?
- Which channels drive sales?
- What does the ideal customer look like?

**Output:** Ideal Customer Profile (ICP) definition for targeted marketing

### Giveaway Campaign Design

Create the lead-gen incentive strategy:

**The Offer:** Free mini-shed delivery (value: $2,500+)
- Something only SNS can offer (unique competitive advantage)
- High perceived value, manageable cost
- Risk mitigation: First campaign could be discounted delivery instead

**Deliverables:**
- Prize/terms/promotion plan
- Landing page copy
- Tracking mechanism
- Winner selection process

---

## Week 2: Build & Deploy

### QR Lot Assistant (MVP)

Every shed gets a QR code that captures visitors:

```
Customer arrives at lot →
    → Parks in designated area (with signage)
    → Scans QR code on shed they're interested in
    → Enters Name + Phone (email optional)
    → Gets entered into giveaway drawing
    → Lot attendant gets instant alert
    → Customer info saved to lead sheet
```

**Deliverables:**
- QR codes for all 3 lots (20 per lot)
- Mobile-optimized lead capture form
- Instant attendant notifications (SMS/email)
- Integration with new lead tracking sheet

### Designated Parking & Signage

Guide visitors to engage:

**Deliverables:**
- Parking area designation plan
- Signage design for lots
- QR code placement strategy
- Installation guidance

### Lead Tracking System

Capture and organize every lead:

**Deliverables:**
- Lead tracking spreadsheet/database
- Meta Pixel installation on landing pages
- "How did you hear about us" attribution
- Source tracking (QR scan, website, walk-in)

---

## Week 3: Intelligence & Follow-Up

### Customer Follow-Up System

Proactive management of post-sale experience to catch Graceland gaps:

**The Problem:** Graceland drops the ball on customer communication. Customers get mad. You lose referrals.

**The Solution:**
```
Contract signed →
    → Day 3: "Just checking in - has Graceland contacted you?"
    → Day 7: "Your build is underway - any questions?"
    → Day 14: "Delivery scheduled - do you have any special instructions?"
    → Post-delivery: "How was your experience?"
```

**Deliverables:**
- Post-contract delivery timeline documentation
- Customer follow-up script templates
- Sequence design (ready for automation)
- Issue escalation workflow

### Data-Driven Ad Strategy

Turn historical data into targeted marketing for March/April campaigns:

**Deliverables:**
- Ideal Customer Profile (ICP) report
- Targeted audience definitions for Meta
- Campaign strategy recommendations
- CPL/CAC/ROAS tracking framework

### ROI Tracking Foundation

Measure what matters:

**Deliverables:**
- Lead source attribution tracking
- Conversion tracking setup
- Basic KPI dashboard (leads, sources, conversion)

---

## What's NOT Included

- Chatbot/AI assistant (future phase)
- Full CRM build (future phase)
- Dealer accountability app (future phase)
- Starlink/infrastructure upgrades (future phase)
- Website rebuild (already handled separately)

---

## Why This Plan Will Generate More Sales

### The Math

**Current State:**
- Lot visitors/month: Unknown (no tracking)
- Capture rate: ~10% (only if attendant engages)
- Ad spend ROI: Unknown ("shotgunning")

**With This System:**
- Lot visitors/month: Tracked
- Capture rate: 50%+ (QR + giveaway incentive)
- Ad spend ROI: Measured and optimized

**Conservative Projection:**
```
20 additional leads/month from QR capture
× 25% close rate
× $5,000 average sale
= $25,000/month additional revenue

Annual impact: $300,000
Investment: $10,000
ROI: 2,900%
```

### What No Other Dealer Can Offer

1. **Free mini-shed delivery** - Unique SNS capability (no other dealer can deliver minis)
2. **Data-driven marketing** - Targeting based on actual sales patterns
3. **Proactive customer experience** - Catch Graceland issues before they become problems
4. **Multi-location lead capture** - Scale across all 3 lots (and Kayenta when ready)
