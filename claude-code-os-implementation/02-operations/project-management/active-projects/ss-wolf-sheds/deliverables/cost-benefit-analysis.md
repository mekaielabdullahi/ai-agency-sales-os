## Risk Factors & Mitigations

### Participation Risk
- **Risk:** Low sign-up rate
- **Mitigation:** Test messaging, A/B test incentive framing

### Redemption Risk
- **Risk:** Low credit redemption hurts perceived value
- **Mitigation:** 12-month expiration, follow-up reminders

### Margin Risk
- **Risk:** Too many redemptions hurt profitability
- **Mitigation:** Credit is for delivery (high-margin service), not product discount

### Data Risk
- **Risk:** Poor data quality limits future marketing
- **Mitigation:** Required fields, phone verification via Clerk
