# Digital Sales Engine: Phase 1 Proposal

**Prepared for:** S&S Wolf Sheds
**Prepared by:** Arise Group AI
**Date:** January 28, 2026

---

## Executive Summary

| | |
|---|---|
| **Investment** | $5,000 |
| **Timeline** | 2-3 weeks |
| **Goal** | Stop lead leakage by capturing organic lot visitors |

### Projected Return on Investment

| Metric | Conservative | Optimistic |
|--------|--------------|------------|
| Year 1 Additional Revenue | +$99,400 | +$148,400 |
| Net Year 1 Benefit | +$93,600 | +$142,600 |
| **Year 1 ROI** | **1,015%** | **2,459%** |

**Break-even:** Converting just ONE additional lead ($8k average sale) pays for the entire investment.

---

## The Problem

Every day, potential customers visit your lot, browse your sheds, and leave—without you ever knowing they were there.

**Right now, S&S Wolf Sheds captures zero information from organic lot visitors.**

This "lead leakage" costs you:
- Lost sales from visitors who needed follow-up
- No data to understand what's working
- No way to reconnect with interested buyers
- Blind spots in your marketing spend

---

## The Solution: Foundational Lead Capture

We'll build a simple, automated system that captures every interested visitor and alerts your staff instantly.

### How It Works

```
Customer arrives at lot
        ↓
Scans QR code on shed placard
        ↓
Signs up in 10 seconds (phone or Google)
        ↓
Receives 10% off their order ($300+ value)
        ↓
Your staff gets instant email notification
        ↓
Staff approaches with context: "I see you're looking at the Side Porch Cabin..."
```

**No apps to download. No complicated forms. Just scan, sign up, and browse.**

---

## What Your Customers Experience

### First Visit

1. **Arrival** — Customer sees welcome placard: "Scan for 10% off your order"
2. **Scan** — Opens phone camera, scans QR code
3. **Sign Up** — Signs in with Google or phone number (10 seconds)
4. **Confirmation** — "You're all set! Your 10% discount is saved."
5. **Browse** — Customer explores the lot freely

### Return Scans (Same Visit)

When a customer scans multiple sheds, the system recognizes them:

- "Welcome back, John! You're checking out the Lofted Barn 12W."
- Shows which sheds they've viewed
- Staff gets updated notification with browsing context

**More scans = more serious buyer.** Your staff knows who's comparing options.

---

## What Your Staff Experience

When a visitor signs up, your lot staff receives an instant email:

```
Subject: 🏠 New Lead at Flagstaff: John Smith

Name: John Smith
Phone: 602-555-1234
Shed: Side Porch Cabin 16W
Time: 2:32 PM

They're browsing the lot now - great time to say hello!
```

**No more guessing.** Staff can approach with relevant information and make a genuine connection.

## April Ad Campaign Foundation

Phase 1 isn't just about capturing leads—it's about making your $400/month ad spend actually work.

### Current State

| Metric | Today |
|--------|-------|
| Ad targeting | "Shotgunning" with no data |
| ROI tracking | None |
| Ideal customer profile | Unknown |

---

### Capability 1: Meta Pixel Tracking

**Finally see who's coming from your ads.**

We install Meta's tracking pixel on your lead capture page. When someone signs up after clicking an ad, you'll know exactly which ad brought them in.

| Before | After |
|--------|-------|
| Blind spend | Full visibility |
| "Did that ad work?" | "That ad brought 12 leads this week" |

---

### Capability 2: Ideal Customer Profile (ICP)

**Know exactly who buys from you.**

We combine your captured leads with 3 years of sales history to build a profile of your ideal customer:

- Demographics (age, location, household)
- Shed preferences (size, style, price range)
- Geographic patterns (which markets convert best)
- Buying triggers (what makes them say yes)

---

### Capability 3: Targeted Audiences (Lookalikes)

**Find more customers like your best buyers.**

Once we know who your customers are, Meta can find thousands of similar people. Instead of "shotgunning" to everyone, you target people who look like the ones already buying.

| Before | After |
|--------|-------|
| Show ads to everyone | Show ads to people like your buyers |
| Hope for the best | Precision targeting |

---

### Capability 4: CPL/CAC/ROAS Tracking

**Know what every lead costs.**

With proper tracking, you'll finally answer: "Which ads actually drive sales?"

| Metric | What It Tells You |
|--------|-------------------|
| **Cost per Lead (CPL)** | How much you pay for each sign-up |
| **Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC)** | Total cost to get a sale |
| **Return on Ad Spend (ROAS)** | Dollars back for every dollar spent |

---

### Capability 5: Seasonal Campaign Data

**Advertise the right sheds at the right time.**

Your captured data reveals patterns: which sheds sell in spring vs. fall, which sizes move fastest, when buyers are most active.

| Insight | Action |
|---------|--------|
| Cabins peak in March-April | Push cabin ads in February |
| Lofted barns sell year-round | Steady budget allocation |
| Weekends drive 60% of visits | Increase weekend ad spend |

---

**Timeline:** By April, you'll have 60+ leads captured and enough data to run targeted campaigns instead of blind advertising.

---

## Timeline

| Week | What Happens |
|------|--------------|
| **Week 1** | Build QR system, lead capture page, sign-up flow |
| **Week 2** | Connect automations, staff notifications, testing |
| **Week 3** | Dashboard, follow-up emails, final polish |

**Go-live:** End of Week 3, with staff trained and system running.

---

## Success Metrics

### What We'll Track Weekly
| Metric | Target |
|--------|--------|
| QR scans per day | 5-10 |
| Sign-up rate | 40%+ |
| Staff response time | Under 5 minutes |

### What We'll Track Monthly
| Metric | Target |
|--------|--------|
| Total leads captured | 60+ |
| Discount redemptions | 20%+ |
| Sales from program | 2+ |
| Monthly revenue impact | $16,000+ |

---

## Investment

| Item | Cost |
|------|------|
| Phase 1: Digital Sales Engine Foundation | $5,000 |
| Ongoing costs (hosting, tools) | Minimal (mostly free tiers) |

### What's Included
- Complete QR code lead capture system
- Staff notification automation
- Customer profile database
- Lead health dashboard
- Automated follow-up email
- Staff training documentation
- 30 days post-launch support

## What We Need From You

To hit our 2-3 week timeline:

1. **Incentive Approval** — Confirm the 10% order discount offer
2. **S&S Logo** — Updated branding for the sign-up page
3. **Shed Inventory** — List of sheds with IDs for QR codes
4. **Staff Email** — Gmail address(es) for notifications
5. **Placard Plan** — Where QR codes will be displayed

---

## Future Opportunities (Phase 2+)

Once Phase 1 is running, we can add:

- Sales dashboard with conversion tracking
- Multi-step email sequences
- Value-added service referrals (site prep, tree trimming)
- Lot-by-lot performance comparison
- Integration with your sales data

**But first, let's capture those leads.**

---

## Why Arise Group

This is Case Study #2 for Arise Group. Our first, Plotter Mechanics, proved our approach: build foundational systems that pay for themselves quickly.

**We succeed only if you succeed.**

That's why we're starting with a $5,000 system that pays for itself with a single converted lead. We're your transformation partner, not a vendor who takes money and disappears.

---

## Next Steps

1. **Review** this proposal
2. **Confirm** the incentive offer
3. **Schedule** kickoff call
4. **Go live** in 2-3 weeks

---

## You Get Clarity. You Get Vision.

Right now, you're flying blind. Visitors come and go. Ad dollars disappear. You hope things are working but you don't really know.

**After Phase 1:**

- **Clarity** — You see every lead, every scan, every opportunity. No more guessing who's on your lot or whether your marketing is working.

- **Vision** — You understand your customer. You know what sells, when it sells, and who buys it. Your decisions are backed by data, not hunches.

This is the foundation. Everything else—better ads, smarter follow-up, higher conversion—builds on this.

**Let's start capturing those leads.**
