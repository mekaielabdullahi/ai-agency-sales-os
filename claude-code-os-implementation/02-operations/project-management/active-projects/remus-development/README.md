## Key Takeaways from Discovery

### The Core Problem
**Bids not converting to contracts** - losing hundreds of thousands per quarter in a relationship-driven Phoenix land development market.

### Root Causes Identified
1. **No follow-up system** - Bids go out fast, then sit with no tracking
2. **Relationship gap** - Unknown entity vs. established competitors
3. **Competitor pressure** - Main competitor bidding at zero margin
4. **Data blindness** - Can't identify why bids are lost

### What Michael Committed To
- [ ] Set up Outlook Tasks for bid follow-up (next week)
- [ ] Train David on the system
- [ ] Add last 2 months of bids
- [ ] Update timesheet template for job costing

### Our Next Steps
- [ ] Analyze transcript for quick-win solutions
- [ ] Draft proposal (if engagement makes sense)
- [ ] Schedule follow-up meeting after holidays

## Team & Roles

| Person | Role | Responsibilities | Compensation |
|--------|------|------------------|--------------|
| Michael Kocourek | Owner | Accounting, BD, strategy | - |
| David Navarez | VP of Ops / Superintendent | Field projects + ALL bids | $3,500/week (cut from $4,500) |
| Chris Andrade | Partner (External) | BD relationships, admin support | TBD |

**Key Insight from Internal Debrief:**
- **Roles are backwards** - Chris is naturally good at relationship BD but got pulled into admin. Michael admits he's not good at relationship building.
- **Optimal allocation:** Chris → External BD (bars, events, social). Michael → Internal ops, systems, bid review.
- **David:** Needs Loom video training (4-5 iterations to learn new processes)

**Note:** Currently doing PIECEWORK for other contractors, not winning full contracts yet.

## Opportunity Assessment

### Quick Wins (Michael Owns)
1. **Outlook Tasks Follow-Up** - P0, no cost, 1 week
2. **Bid Tracker Simplification** - P0, 15+ colors → 5-7, build on Chris's existing spreadsheets

### Potential Engagement
3. **BD Enablement** - P1, two options: enable Michael OR Chris does BD
4. **CRM/Pipeline Visibility** - P2, if quick wins prove concept
5. **Time Optimization Automations** - P2, free Michael from mundane tasks

### NOT Recommended
- ❌ **Bid Automation** - Michael explicitly resistant, $3.6M error risk too high
- ❌ **Cold job site outreach** - Chris tried it, hostile responses

## 2025 Outlook

| Item | Status |
|------|--------|
| 3 small projects | Committed for January |
| 2 large subcontracts | Awaiting GC award (could exceed 2024 total revenue) |
| Runway | "Enough money to be dangerous next year" |

## Michael's Communication Style
- Short, clear, bullet points
- Hates rambling
- Wants "boiled down"
- Needs **why before how**
- "Not a fan of getting cutesy"

---

## Key Insights

> **Michael doesn't need AI tools right now.**
> He needs basic follow-up discipline (Outlook Tasks) and time.
> Our role: Support, not replace. Quick wins he can own.

> **Roles are backwards.**
> Chris should do relationship BD (his strength). Michael should do internal ops (his strength).
> Automation can enable this swap by reducing Michael's admin burden.

> **Cold outreach doesn't work in this market.**
> Chris tried job site approaches - hostile responses. Need warm relationship approaches (bars, associations, supplier networks).
