# Post-Discovery Update - Remus Development

**Source:** Internal discussion on December 23, 2025
**Participants:** Chris Andrade, Trent, Matthew Kerns
**Channel:** #remus Slack Huddle (3:36 PM - 3:53 PM PST)

## Confirmed Findings

| Finding from Discovery | Confirmed By | Reason |
|------------------------|--------------|--------|
| David is not tech-savvy | Chris | "David will learn it just takes maybe 4 or 5 iterations of the same process" |
| Relationship-based market | All | Chris confirmed cold outreach doesn't work |
| No job costing on current work | Chris | "We really haven't won a contract that we're able to associate labor or man hour or overhead cost" |
| Need simple tools (Outlook Tasks) | All | Confirmed as appropriate approach |

---

## Contradicted/Corrected Findings

| Original Finding | Correction | Source |
|------------------|------------|--------|
| David's salary: $3,500/week | **CORRECTED:** Was $4,500/week until 3 weeks ago, cut to $3,500 | Chris |
| Bids not converting | **NUANCE:** They're doing PIECEWORK for other contractors, not winning full contracts - different problem | Chris |

---

## New Information

### 1. Chris Has Existing Spreadsheets
**Source:** Chris Andrade
**Detail:** "I got tired of it, so I built the goddamn spreadsheet with man-hour factors to ultimately give me a calculation per line item of what our rough profit will be"
**Implication:** We don't need to build profit calculation tools - build on what exists

### 2. Job Site Cold Outreach Failed (But Bar Scene Works)
**Source:** Chris Andrade
**Detail on failure:** "I did that and I went to 4 job sites, walked up, all legit. I had my gear, hard hat, boots, the whole nine... I was not welcome..."
**Detail on what works:** "If I was at a bar or something or a restaurant and I just so happened to know somebody or see somebody, then that shit is really different."
**Implication:** Job site cold outreach is NOT viable. But other BD approaches (industry watering holes, associations, trade shows, supplier networks) need to be researched and tested.

### 3. David Was Above Market Value
**Source:** Chris Andrade
**Detail:** "$4,500 up to 3 weeks ago" - which is $234k/year
**Implication:** Financial pressure is real. David's pay cut = cost reduction mode.

### 4. Currently Piecework Only
**Source:** Chris Andrade
**Detail:** "We've been doing just piecework at the moment for other contractors because they are too busy and in order to meet their timeline, they use people like us"
**Implication:** Not winning full contracts yet - harder to get job costing data on piecework.

### 5. Technology Adoption Approach Needed
**Source:** Chris Andrade
**Detail:** "Legit like the mouse would need to be set, spun up, spun down, like going to click on this file, like legit"
**Implication:** Loom training videos should be created for any new process.

### 6. Chatbot for Outreach (New Idea)
**Source:** Matthew Kerns
**Detail:** "Just automate all the outreach somehow, where like he can just talk with a chatbot and be like, these are all the people I know, help me schedule"
**Implication:** BD outreach automation opportunity identified.

## Nuanced Findings

| Original Finding | Additional Context |
|------------------|-------------------|
| No formal follow-up process | + Chris was doing BD outreach but got pulled into admin (timesheets, payroll, document management) |
| David does bids after hours | + When Chris was handling admin, David could focus on field and bids - now Chris is gone |
| Competitors bidding at zero margin | + Remus taking piecework from those same overbooked competitors |

## Internal-Only Notes

*(Sensitive information not for client documentation)*

- David may have fault in budget situation (high salary with no budget)
- Chris is "just another guy who can just push paperwork through" - not core delivery
- Call went "way better than anticipated" - positive sign for engagement
- Michael "struggling to find himself a little bit" - vulnerable state
- Team sees opportunities that client didn't surface in discovery

---

## Required Updates

### Process Map Updates
- [x] Correct: David's salary from $3,500 to show history ($4,500 → $3,500)
- [x] Add: Note that current work is PIECEWORK, not full contracts
- [x] Add: Cold outreach tried and failed (Chris's experience)
- [x] Add: Loom training videos as recommended approach

### Opportunity Matrix Updates
- [x] Add: Chris's existing spreadsheets as an asset to build on
- [x] Reprioritize: BD Outreach - cold calling NOT viable, relationship-only
- [x] Add: Chatbot for BD outreach scheduling as potential solution
- [x] Add note: Job costing harder because piecework, not full contracts

### Discovery Unknowns Updates
- [x] Resolved: "What tech has David resisted?" - Answer: Needs step-by-step Loom videos, 4-5 iterations
- [x] Resolved: "How do you know competitors are bidding at zero margin?" - They're overbooked and subbing work to Remus
- [x] New question: What piecework jobs has Remus done and what data exists from those?
- [x] New question: Can Chris's existing spreadsheets be reviewed and built upon?

## Key Insights for Proposal

### Changed Understanding
1. **Work type is PIECEWORK, not full contracts** - This changes the job costing opportunity. Piecework has less data to capture.
2. **Cold outreach proven ineffective** - Chris tried it, got hostile responses. Must be relationship-only approach.
3. **Existing assets available** - Chris built spreadsheets with man-hour factors. Don't reinvent.
4. **David needs video training** - Very explicit, step-by-step Loom videos. Not documentation.
5. **Role allocation is backwards** - Chris is naturally better at relationship BD but got pulled into admin. Michael is doing BD but admits he's not good at relationship building.

### Role Optimization Insight (NEW)

| Person | Current Focus | Optimal Focus |
|--------|--------------|---------------|
| Michael | BD + Admin + Accounting | Internal ops, systems, accounting |
| Chris | Admin (timesheets, payroll) | Relationship BD (bars, events, social) |
| David | Estimation + Field | Stay as is (at capacity) |

**Key Evidence:**
- Michael: "I would have gotten right to the business. I wouldn't even have asked about the football. And that's probably why I have such a hard time."
- Chris: "If I was at a bar or something or a restaurant and I just so happened to know somebody or see somebody, then that shit is really different."

**Recommendation:** Swap Michael and Chris's BD/Admin split. Chris does relationship BD, Michael handles internal systems.

### Hidden Blockers
1. Chris used to handle admin (timesheets, payroll, document management) - now Michael has to
2. David's salary cut 3 weeks ago - financial pressure is acute
3. Chris's BD efforts got derailed by being pulled into operations
4. Job site cold outreach doesn't work - but other BD approaches need testing (bars, associations, trade shows)

### Engagement Considerations
1. **Keep solutions VERY simple** - David needs explicit training
2. **Build on Chris's spreadsheets** - Don't create new systems
3. **BD focus is critical** - Research alternative approaches (industry watering holes, associations, supplier networks)
4. **Chatbot for scheduling/outreach** - Matt's idea worth exploring once BD approach is validated

### Quick Wins Validation
| Quick Win | Status | Adjustment Needed |
|-----------|--------|-------------------|
| Outlook Tasks for follow-up | STILL VIABLE | Needs Loom video training for David |
| Bid tracker simplification | STILL VIABLE | Use Chris's spreadsheet as starting point |
| Timesheet/job costing | NEEDS ADJUSTMENT | Harder with piecework vs. full contracts |
| BD Outreach Strategy | RESEARCH NEEDED | Test alternative approaches (bars, associations, supplier networks) before automation |
