| What tools has David rejected? | Adoption barriers |
| What processes have you tried to implement that failed? | Risk factors |

## Next Steps to Resolve

### Immediate (Before Proposal)
1. [ ] Request copy of bid tracker spreadsheet
2. [ ] Schedule 15-min call with David (or have Michael relay questions)
3. [ ] Get status update on January projects

### Before Implementation
4. [ ] Screen share of takeoff software → Excel workflow
5. [ ] Review Microsoft 365 subscription details
6. [ ] Document current Outlook usage

---

## Assumptions Made (Need Validation)

| Assumption | Risk if Wrong | How to Validate |
|------------|---------------|-----------------|
| David will adopt Outlook Tasks | HIGH - entire plan depends on it | Michael gauges receptiveness |
| Bid tracker data is mostly complete | MEDIUM - pattern analysis fails | Review actual spreadsheet |
| Follow-up will reveal why bids lost | MEDIUM - may not get answers | Test with first few calls |
| Microsoft 365 includes basic CRM | LOW - alternative approaches exist | Check subscription |
| January projects provide runway | HIGH - changes urgency | Confirm contract status |
