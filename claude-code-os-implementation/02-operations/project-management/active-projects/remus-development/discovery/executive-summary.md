**Last Updated:** December 23, 2025
**Status:** Discovery + Internal Debrief Complete
**Sources:** Discovery call (71 min) + Internal team debrief (17 min)

## The Business

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Company** | Remus Development LLC |
| **Industry** | Concrete & site civil contracting (land development) |
| **Location** | Phoenix metro |
| **Market Position** | Unknown entity in relationship-driven market |
| **Current Work** | Piecework for other contractors (not winning full contracts yet) |

---

## The Core Problem

**Bids not converting to contracts** - losing hundreds of thousands per quarter.

### Why Bids Aren't Converting

1. **Relationship gap** - Land developers never Google for contractors. They use established relationships. Remus is unknown.
2. **No follow-up system** - Bids go out fast, then sit with no tracking or systematic follow-up.
3. **No feedback loop** - Don't know WHY bids are lost (price? relationship? project cancelled?).
4. **Competitor pressure** - Main competitor bidding at zero margin just to stay afloat.

## The Team

| Person | Role | Strengths | Current Focus |
|--------|------|-----------|---------------|
| **Michael Kocourek** | Owner | Spreadsheets, bid review, accounting, systems | BD + Admin + Accounting |
| **David Navarez** | VP Ops / Superintendent | 40 years estimation, field delivery, industry relationships | Bids + Field |
| **Chris Andrade** | Partner (External) | Relationship building, social situations | Admin support |

### Key Insight: Roles Are Backwards

- **Michael** admits he's not good at relationship building ("I would have gotten right to the business")
- **Chris** is naturally good at it ("at a bar or restaurant... that shit is really different")
- **Current state:** Chris doing admin, Michael doing BD
- **Optimal state:** Chris does BD, Michael does internal ops

## What We Learned

### From Discovery Call (Michael)

| Finding | Detail |
|---------|--------|
| Bid process works | David creates bids fast (2 hours to 1 week), often first to submit |
| Follow-up is broken | No formal system, "my head is the CRM" |
| Solution exists | Michael knows Outlook Tasks works - just needs to implement |
| Tech resistance | David needs simple tools, Loom video training |
| AI skepticism | Bid automation rejected - $3.6M error risk too high |
| 2025 outlook | 3 projects committed + 2 large pending (could exceed 2024 total) |

### From Internal Debrief (Chris, Trent, Matt)

| Finding | Detail |
|---------|--------|
| David's salary cut | Was $4,500/week, now $3,500 (3 weeks ago) |
| Cold outreach failed | Chris tried job sites - hostile responses |
| Existing assets | Chris built spreadsheets with man-hour factors for profit calculation |
| Currently piecework | Not winning full contracts, doing overflow for busy competitors |
| Training approach | David needs explicit Loom videos (4-5 iterations to learn) |

## BD Strategy Options

### Option A: Enable Michael
Keep Michael doing BD but remove friction with tools:
- Auto-generated daily call lists
- Pre-call briefs on contact history
- Voice-to-text post-call logging
- Touch cadence automation

### Option B: Chris Does BD (Recommended)
Play to natural strengths:
- Chris: External relationships (bars, events, social settings)
- Michael: Internal ops, systems, bid review, accounting
- Automation bridges the two (shared pipeline visibility)

### What Doesn't Work
- ❌ Cold job site outreach (hostile responses)
- ❌ Flyer distribution
- ❌ Unsolicited approaches

### What to Test
- Industry watering holes (bars/restaurants)
- Construction associations
- Supplier network referrals
- Existing contact introductions

---

## Opportunities

### Quick Wins (Michael Owns - No Cost)
1. **Outlook Tasks for bid follow-up** - P0, 1 week to implement
2. **Bid tracker simplification** - P0, reduce 15+ colors to 5-7, use Chris's spreadsheets

### Potential Engagement
3. **BD enablement tools** - P1, chatbot for contact capture and scheduling
4. **Time optimization automations** - P2, free Michael from mundane tasks
5. **CRM/pipeline visibility** - P2, if quick wins prove concept

### Not Recommended
- ❌ Bid automation - Michael explicitly resistant, risk too high
- ❌ Complex new software - David won't adopt it

---

## Michael's Time Drains (Automation Opportunities)

| Task | Current State | Automation |
|------|--------------|------------|
| Bid follow-up tracking | Manual Outlook Tasks | Auto-create from bid emails |
| Bid tracker updates | 15+ statuses, behind | Auto-sync from Outlook |
| Payroll entry | Manual from scanned timesheets | OCR extraction |
| Invoice follow-up | Manual tracking | Automated reminders |
| BD outreach scheduling | Mental overhead | Chatbot + daily call list |

---

## Open Questions (Follow-Up Needed)

### BD Role Allocation
- How much time can Chris commit to BD?
- Does Michael WANT to do relationship BD?
- What is Chris's compensation arrangement?

### BD Approach
- Where do Phoenix land developers hang out?
- What construction associations exist?
- Which concrete suppliers could provide referrals?

### Baseline Data
- Exact bid count and conversion rate?
- Specific reasons for losses?
- What worked when they DID win?

---

## Next Steps

### Client-Owned
- [ ] Michael implements Outlook Tasks for bid follow-up
- [ ] Train David (with Loom videos)
- [ ] Simplify bid tracker using Chris's spreadsheets

### Arise-Owned
- [ ] Research BD approaches for concrete industry
- [ ] Draft proposal based on discovery findings
- [ ] Schedule follow-up meeting after holidays

## Key Takeaways

> **Michael doesn't need AI tools right now.**
> He needs basic follow-up discipline (Outlook Tasks) and time.
> Our role: Support, not replace. Quick wins he can own.

> **Roles are backwards.**
> Chris should do relationship BD. Michael should do internal ops.
> Automation can enable this swap.

> **Cold outreach doesn't work.**
> Must use warm relationship approaches (bars, associations, referrals).
