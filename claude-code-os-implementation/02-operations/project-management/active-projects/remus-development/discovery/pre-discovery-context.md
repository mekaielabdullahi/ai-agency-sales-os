# Remus Development - Pre-Discovery Context

**Created:** December 23, 2025
**Purpose:** Context gathered before discovery call from Chris and prior conversations
**Status:** Historical reference (discovery complete)

---

## What We Knew Going In

Mike was **not asking for tools.** He was dealing with **operational breakdown under survival pressure.**

The company was described as:
- Cash-poor
- Bid-heavy but contract-light
- Operationally fragmented
- Emotionally overloaded at the leadership level
- Lacking clear ownership, systems, and communication guardrails

**Discovery approach:** Start by **stabilizing the chaos** and surfacing where revenue, trust, and execution are leaking.

---

## Pre-Discovery Problem Hypotheses

### 1. Bids Are Not Turning Into Contracts

**Symptoms (from Chris):**
- "We're putting out a ton of bids"
- "We need to know why we're not getting awarded"
- "We lost the Fiesta job because the contract wasn't signed"
- Missed deadlines, delayed signatures, lost momentum

**Hypothesized Root Causes:**
- No structured follow-up on bids
- No owner assigned to contract execution
- No system to flag urgency or risk
- Decision paralysis under stress

---

### 2. No Central System of Truth (CRM + Process Failure)

**Symptoms (from Chris):**
- "My head is the CRM"
- "User error"
- Things slip because they rely on memory
- No reminders, no accountability, no tracking

**Hypothesized Root Causes:**
- No CRM or one that isn't enforced
- No automated reminders
- No visibility into pipeline or relationships
- Over-reliance on people instead of systems

---

### 3. Contract Risk + Legal Blind Spots

**Symptoms (from Chris):**
- Hesitation signing MSAs
- Clauses he believes are illegal
- No attorney reviewing contracts
- New business = low leverage

**Hypothesized Root Causes:**
- No standardized contract review process
- No red-flag checklist
- No legal abstraction/summarization workflow
- Risk decisions made under time pressure

---

### 4. Missed Execution Due to Availability Constraints

**Symptoms (from Chris):**
- "I have to be available"
- "I'm stuck doing something I don't want to be doing"
- On the road, limited time
- Decisions delayed because Mike isn't free

**Hypothesized Root Causes:**
- No delegation framework
- No escalation rules
- No async decision support
- Everything bottlenecks at Mike

---

### 5. Role Confusion & Communication Breakdown (Internal)

**Symptoms (from Chris):**
- Missed contract signing because "I assumed David would"
- Time sheets missing
- Confusion about who owns what
- Emotional friction between team members

**Hypothesized Root Causes:**
- No documented SOPs
- No RACI (who owns, approves, informs)
- No enforced communication rules
- Informal assumptions replacing clarity

---

### 6. Financial Survival Pressure (Driving All Behavior)

**Symptoms (from Chris):**
- $200 in the account
- $10k in bills
- Considering loans as "last hurrah"
- Stress is influencing decision-making

**Hypothesized Root Causes:**
- Revenue unpredictability
- Delayed projects
- Lack of forecasting visibility
- No early-warning system

---

## Mike's Communication Preference (From Chris)

**Explicitly stated:**
- Needs short, clear, bullet points
- Hates rambling
- Wants "boiled down"
- Needs to understand **why before how**

**Implication:** Discovery must be:
- Structured
- Time-boxed
- Agenda-driven
- Outcome-oriented

---

## Pre-Discovery Hypothesis

**Mike doesn't want:**
- Tools
- Dashboards
- Fancy AI demos

**Mike wants:**
- Fewer dropped balls
- Fewer surprises
- Fewer fires
- Contracts that close
- Cash that comes in
