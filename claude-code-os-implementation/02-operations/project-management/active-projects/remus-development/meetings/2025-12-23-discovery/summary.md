## Executive Summary

Discovery call to identify Remus Development's business challenges and explore AI solutions. Primary issue is **bid-to-contract conversion** - losing hundreds of thousands per quarter in a relationship-driven market where competitors bid at zero margin.

---

## Key Takeaways

| Finding | Detail |
|---------|--------|
| **Primary Bottleneck** | Converting bids to contracts - losing $100k+/quarter |
| **Root Cause** | Breaking into relationship-driven market; established competitors bidding at zero margin |
| **Immediate Action** | Outlook Tasks for bid follow-up (low friction, avoids new software resistance) |
| **Automation Stance** | Highly skeptical - $4M bid error risk too high; human review negates time savings |
| **2025 Outlook** | 3 small projects secured; awaiting 2 large subcontract awards (could exceed 2024 total) |

---

## The Core Problem: Low Bid-to-Contract Conversion

### Financial Pressure
- Struggling to win enough work to cover overhead
- Bids include profit, but not converting
- **Estimated loss:** Hundreds of thousands per quarter

### Market Dynamics
- Phoenix land development is highly relationship-driven
- Remus is unknown entity vs. established firms
- Competitors bidding at zero profit to stay afloat

---

## The Bidding Process

### Current Workflow
1. **Takeoff:** David uses takeoff software on CAD plans (2-135 pages) to get quantities
2. **Pricing:** Quantities manually entered into Excel to assign $/unit costs
3. **Submission:** Bid sent to customer

### The Gap
- Follow-up is informal and ad-hoc
- No tracking of why bids are lost
- No visibility into pending bid status

### Proposed Solution
- **Outlook Tasks** for formal follow-up system
- Leverages existing software (Microsoft 365)
- Avoids CRM complexity David would resist
- **Blocker:** Michael's personal time constraints, not team resistance

---

## Team & Roles

| Person | Role | Responsibilities |
|--------|------|------------------|
| Michael Kocourek | Owner | Accounting, business development |
| David Navarez | VP of Ops/Superintendent | Field projects + ALL bids (after hours when field is heavy) |

**David's Compensation:** $3,500/week salary - bid labor not extra

---

## Automation & Data Management

### Bidding Automation - NOT NOW
- **Michael's stance:** Highly resistant
- **Risk:** Transposed number on $4M bid = $3.6M loss
- **Belief:** Human review step negates any time savings

### Job Costing - NEEDED
- Critical need for accurate data
- **Plan:** David to direct crews to record daily production on timesheets
- **Enforcement:** "Shape up or ship out" policy

### Bid Tracker - EXISTS, NEEDS WORK
- Current spreadsheet is overly complex (15+ status colors)
- **Goal:** Simplify to identify patterns (e.g., why home builder bids consistently lost)

---

## Action Items

### Remus Development
- [ ] Set up Outlook Tasks for bid follow-up
- [ ] Train David on the system
- [ ] Add last 2 months of bids
- [ ] Start follow-up cadence
- [ ] Update timesheet template to include daily production notes

## Next Steps

1. **Quick Win:** Get Outlook Tasks follow-up running (Remus owns)
2. **Proposal:** Arise to draft based on discovery findings
3. **Follow-up Meeting:** Review proposal, discuss implementation support

---

## Opportunity Assessment

**What they have:**
- Fast bid creation (David, 30 years experience)
- Speed to market (first to submit)
- Microsoft 365 with CRM capability
- Existing bid tracker (needs simplification)

**What they lack:**
- Follow-up process/discipline
- Visibility into why bids fail
- Data for pattern analysis
- Time to implement solutions

**Potential Quick Wins:**
1. Outlook Tasks follow-up system (they own implementation)
2. Bid tracker simplification (enable pattern analysis)
3. Timesheet template update (job costing data)
