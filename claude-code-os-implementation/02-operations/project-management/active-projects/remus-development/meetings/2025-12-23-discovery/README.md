# Remus Development - Discovery Call
**Date:** December 23, 2025
**Type:** Discovery
**Attendees:** Mike, Chris, Matt

---

## Agenda
1. Revenue Flow - bids → contracts → cash
2. Decision Bottlenecks - what waits on Mike
3. Execution Gaps - where things fall through
4. Risk Exposure - contracts & compliance
5. Visibility - what Mike can't see today

---

## Notes

### Core Problem: Bids Not Converting to Contracts
- Mike: "not entirely sure why" they're having a hard time converting
- No visibility into why bids don't convert
- Don't know if losing on price, timing, relationship, or other factors

### Competitive Landscape
- Biggest competitor bidding at zero margin (no profit)
- Can't compete on price alone
- Overhead already cut to the bone - only 1 person (David) doing bids

### Bid Creation Process
- Sheets exported from CAD software
- Next software calculates quantities from CAD export
- Quantities manually entered into spreadsheet
- Dollar amount per unit determined manually
- **Time to create bid:** 2 hours to 1 week depending on project size
- Project complexity: 2 pages to 135+ pages of plans
- **Process owner:** David (Mike doesn't have full visibility into this)

### Open Questions
- No pre-qualification before investing time in bids?
- Who owns follow-up after bid goes out?
- How are pending bids tracked?
- What happens between bid sent → contract signed?
