0:00 - Chris Andrade
I'm really excited about this one, guys. I honestly swear to God, I would not thought we would have been ready for this kind of conversation for another month. Like, legitimately, when I started all this. yeah, that's crazy.

0:21 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Yeah, I think we're starting to move quickly here.

0:26 - Trent Christopher (40 Hero)
That's what I want. That's what I was talking to Mikel about earlier. Like, hey, I'm game to try to take this on. So, I'm ready to make this happen. I've been way too cautious in my previous. Me too, bro.

0:39 - Chris Andrade
Me too. Let's go.

0:41 - Trent Christopher (40 Hero)
Yeah, so. What is it? We got this, dude. We got this.

0:45 - Chris Andrade
Listen, I got so much faith in you guys, bro. I just want to just keep putting them in the pipeline. Let's keep getting our reps in. Let's keep pushing that iron. Let's keep eventually, with this discovery call, we can separate in the two groups. Right. If that's the volume that we need to consist of, mean, eventually we might need to do our own discovery calls, right? I mean, that's the point of all this, right? And then that's just the tip of the funnel at that point. And then, obviously, I think we bring a better closing rate initially with all four of us when we're in our second, you know, when we're actually going through the matrixes and stuff.

1:33 - Trent Christopher (40 Hero)
Yeah. Yeah. And then we'll be able to fine tune it, right? But then, you know, Matthew and I expect at some point we're going to be more focused on trying to get the development or the delivery, right? Right. Yeah.

1:46 - Chris Andrade
And that's where me and Mekaiel will be doing it.

1:51 - Mekaiel Abdullahi
Yeah.

1:51 - Trent Christopher (40 Hero)
And we'll leverage whatever resources we can, you know, within the group where it would make sense. And then the same thing, you know, outside the group. Yep.

2:06 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
And Mekaiel might even jump in on some development stuff while Trent's gone. We were talking about that.

2:13 - Mekaiel Abdullahi
That's Lego, bro. I fit anywhere. Just use it. That's what I'm talking about, dude.

2:22 - Chris Andrade
there's no way we can feel at this, guys. There's no way. Like, legit. There's just no way.

2:27 - Trent Christopher (40 Hero)
I won't be wanting to get on long calls and be on, you know, spending the whole evening while I'm, you know, gone. But, you know, in the evenings, I will have time to be able to take a call so we can we can sync up and see how I can help.

2:42 - Mekaiel Abdullahi
I feel like we're still figuring out how we're doing things, but I feel like once we do, it wouldn't make sense to divide and compare and like just do just like save time and just be more efficient, you know?

2:51 - Chris Andrade
Mekaiel, check your microphone settings in Google.

2:55 - Trent Christopher (40 Hero)
I feel like it's not the same in Google as it is in Slack. I agree. agree. I

3:00 - Chris Andrade
And I meant to actually thank you for saying that, Trent, because that's one of the things, do you have like a mic in your, like, is it on your, attached to your camera?

3:10 - Mekaiel Abdullahi
Oh, I think that's why. was pulling my webcam mic on Google meeting instead of my actual mic mic. Yeah, that's better. You like that better. Thank you guys. Yeah.

3:22 - Trent Christopher (40 Hero)
You can't hear how you sound on the other end. I probably sound crazy. It just sounded distant. Did it sound like that yesterday?

3:29 - Mekaiel Abdullahi
Like all day yesterday? Probably during the meeting, right? Yeah. I think it did, yeah.

3:34 - Trent Christopher (40 Hero)
So that's it. Yeah. We're getting it figured out. Yeah, just remind me, hopefully it doesn't state it out.

3:41 - Mekaiel Abdullahi
Hey, how do you, how do I sound with the mic from the Insta?

3:45 - Trent Christopher (40 Hero)
It's all right. It's all right. I mean, it's a little better than what Mikael sounded like, but it's not as clear.

3:50 - Mekaiel Abdullahi
My mic was trash and I'm soft-spoken, so those two things don't mix, you know what I mean? If you're loud and your mic doesn't work, maybe that's a good thing. Aw.

4:00 - Chris Andrade
Oh, I'm excited for this one, man. I'm excited for this one. I hope. Man, Mike, man, oh, man. Let's see. So when do you actually leave Trent? Like, are you having, is this like in your, like, do you have to go out of state? Or, like, travel at all for this, or?

4:31 - Trent Christopher (40 Hero)
I have to stay in an hour, an hour away from home, but because I'm working 12 hour days, I'm staying in a hotel because, I mean, if I'm driving an hour there, working 12 hours, and then turn on driving an hour back, all I'm doing is literally sleeping, getting back up and doing it again. So I stay in a hotel to avoid that situation, plus the risk of driving when I'm tired, right? Yep. And the client pays for it. So, like, my client, I bill the hotel to them. So, it's I I can't be home, that's the only thing that sucks, so, but I'll be, when I get off, when I get off out of the factory, I'll be able to sync up with you guys.

5:11 - Mekaiel Abdullahi
No stress, do your thing, like handle, handle your, we'll hold down the fort for you, you know.

5:16 - Chris Andrade
Bro, wait till you come back, wait till you come back, we're gonna go, like, okay, so what do you want to do, bro, we got like 15 digressions that we need to travel on, so.

5:28 - Trent Christopher (40 Hero)
I mean, I'll, I'll be open for chatting, like I have the internet in the factory, so I can still do that, I just can't get on calls and spend a lot of, you know, time and effort on things, so that's all, so, I can still communicate. Just reviews the autoclod, the autoclod progress. Yeah, yeah, I'm curious to see how that goes. So how's the water mechanics situation, like, what's an update over there, is anything really good, able to get accomplished so far, or We've, we've talked a bit about. How we're going to approach it, and really the way this is going to work is that we're going to be able to leverage a lot of the way that Quo and Jobber work together. We did go, we did backpedal a little bit and say, well, wait a minute, there's a AI receptionist in Plotter, like, sorry not Plotter, Jobber, in Jobber, and maybe that will handle a lot of things, and maybe we don't need Quo, but when we started to look at it, there's some functionality that is good. It's nice because you can just toggle on settings and it does things, but there's also some other limitations that I don't know if it's going to be enough for what we need. So, well, like, for example, if we're going to build things, like, it doesn't record, the receptionist in Jobber does not record calls, it only records the receptionist conversation with a client. Right. It doesn't record a phone call.

6:58 - Chris Andrade
So, conversation conversation An email or a text?

7:01 - Trent Christopher (40 Hero)
No, like a phone call, like, like if you're talking to a client, you're talking to a client, person-to-person, person-to-person conversation, it, Quo will record the conversation. So, sorry, sorry, Chris is just messing, Chris is messing with me, the visuals are just messing with me. But Jobber does not, Jobber only gives you transcripts for the conversation that the AI receptionist is having with other people, so you can't, yeah, so, but it does the basics of the thing that you would expect, a little bit beyond the basics of what you'd expect an AI assistant or a receptionist to do, like you can toggle it on and it can answer the phone call, and then you can ask it to redirect phone calls to people, yeah.

7:57 - Chris Andrade
Mike, Mike, Mike is here, Mike. This is the all-star. Can you hear us, buddy?

8:07 - Trent Christopher (40 Hero)
You're muted, looks like, Mike. Yeah, you got your mute on there, buddy.

8:11 - Chris Andrade
Little microphone towards the bottom, I think.

8:15 - Trent Christopher (40 Hero)
I think he's on iPhone, too. Yeah, I don't remember what the app looks like on the iPhone. I think it's bottom left. Yeah.

8:25 - Chris Andrade
No worries. You'll figure it out, Mike. Yeah, you're still on mute. I see you in here. There you go.

8:35 - Michael Kocourek
Got I kept clicking the mute off button, and I kept wanting to go to full screen. So, you know. I know you're probably in transition right now.

8:47 - Chris Andrade
Dave Navaris, he's getting ready. Marty is on there, getting ready to head to El Paso. So he's going to just call me on Teams. You know, ultimately, Mike, I just wanted to. Just introduce you to the guys and, you know, just listen to, you know, just all the, all the craziness, you know, and yeah, Mekaiel, he's going to be leading the, the, the meeting, and I'll just be here for support. Okay.

9:18 - Mekaiel Abdullahi
Awesome. Hey, Michael, my name is Mekaiel. just want to get us started to go over the agenda. First, thank you for taking the time out of your day to talk to us. We really appreciate it. We know it's busy with the holidays and everything. Um, and we'll just, I'll introduce myself and then Matthew and Trent will introduce himself briefly. Then I'll get into who we are, what we offer. And then we're just here to have a conversation and listen, or we're going to ask you some questions and feel free to go as detailed or as you want, um, or as brief as you like. And, um, myself, I've been in information technology last 10 years, mostly in department of state and department of defense, worked in some cool places like the Pentagon, uh, us, uh, airman, uh, veteran worked in, uh, support in, largest air force base in Germany for about four years. From 2016 to 2020, I did some work at the Pentagon, and then did some work at some U.S. embassies, doing some technical security integrations, and then started my AI ventures, I'd say, earlier this year, and ran into these gentlemen about a few weeks ago, and we started this agency, and I'll just briefly turn it over to Matthew and Trent to introduce themselves, and then I'll get into who we are, what we offer. So a little bit about me, my name is Matthew Kerns.

10:30 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Right after college, my first job was at Amazon.com as a software development engineer, so did professional software engineering at Amazon for six years, got promoted about halfway through to a larger role where I was managing, I was more managing teams and overseeing architectural stuff and design reviews, so learned a lot while I was there from a lot of people that were smarter than me for pretty much the whole time. And then learned how to create production-grade software. So nowadays when you hear about like vibe coding and all these things, some of the issues are that it's like not quite fully functional, but I can help with that. So I left there about three and a half to four years ago to start my own e-commerce company. So I have about three and a half years of just trying to figure out how to make a working business. Um, and, uh, recently that business has started having, uh, cashflow issues. So I'm very familiar with the, the struggles of entrepreneurship, but that's why I started digging back, getting back into coding, uh, this year and creating software, which is my core skill. So to start generating more cash, and then also that's how I ran into these guys. I started creating automations, um, in April and just getting up to speed on all the tools. Tools and stuff for the last several months, and then met these guys about a month or a month and a half ago, and we've just been hitting the ground running ever since. So I've been talking for a while, but that's mostly about me.

12:13 - Trent Christopher (40 Hero)
Thanks, Matthew. Yeah, so my name is Trent Christopher. I have been an industrial automation engineer for 22 years, and basically physical processes, automating those. I started from a small company, I started with a small company, and worked my way up to engineering in that company, and then I worked my way to a machine builder that was roughly $30 million a year. They still are about $30 million a year revenue, and I have them as a client now because I started my own business after I spent six years at a multi-billion dollar corporation, this global home run electronics that makes automation equipment. Basically, I've still followed the same path, just different company. And then I was like, you know what? I want to start my own thing. so... you. Thank So I went off in the past year, started my own thing, started my own thing, 4.0 Hero, and I've been focused on trying to run my own business, just like Matthew said, trying to figure out the entrepreneurial dream, which sometimes is a struggle. But anyway, met these guys, and now we're starting this agency to be able to help people automate their business processes, and that's kind of me. Okay.

13:27 - Mekaiel Abdullahi
Any questions for any of us, Michael? Before I get into who we are? I'm sorry? Any questions? No, no, no.

13:35 - Michael Kocourek
What is the name of your organization, your business? So we're called Arise Group AI.

13:40 - Mekaiel Abdullahi
So we are a transformation partnership agency. We offer AI strategy and development in a few different ways. So with that being said, we have a plethora of tools and experience to do that. But our process that we've been developing is kind of just assessing. this. We're about about We need your help, essentially. You guys are the experts in your industries. We do have the technical expertise, but you guys have the insights required to run your business. So what we'd like to do is just have a conversation, ask you guys what kind of bottle points, what kind of pain points and bottlenecks you guys are facing, and identify ways and solutions on how you guys would ideally solve them. And then we just go in and analyze that and see where it makes sense to plug and play AI, as you could say. But before we get into that, just, we listened to, Chris has told us so much about you. We listened to some of the calls, but in just, in your own words, we'd like you to describe who you guys are and what you guys offer.

14:42 - Michael Kocourek
Well, we're a concrete and a site civil contractor. So we self-perform concrete, whether it be flat work. We're also getting into foundations now, trying to market into that other aspect of the concrete market. We have heretofore been almost exclusive. B2B, business-to-business, where we work with land developers, general contractors, and whatnot, so we're out marketing specifically to the land development industry, both in residential and commercial, I would say probably, well, it doesn't matter what breakdown we have, but we're a small company, we just started, I don't know if Chris has told you a little bit, we had some growing troubles at the beginning, and we're past that now. And honestly, our main problem is turning bids into accepted contracts for work, our main pressure point is on the revenue side, just making enough revenue to cover payroll, you know, we're, our bids to be competitive, well, I don't know if we're being competitive, I haven't heard much feedback from the people we're talking with, the only thing I can go on is our VP of operations, David Navarez, he he has a long history. He's in this industry, and he knows what the prevailing costs are for certain items in the concrete world, and based on what he's producing as far as bids, I have to think that we're competitive, we have had some bids accepted, but the problem is our bids do have profit, but when we don't have enough work to cover our overhead all the time, then we make a little profit on our job, then it's just eaten up. over the next two weeks, or three weeks, or a month when we're not working, because obviously if we're not working, we're not generating revenue, so we have a lot of, there is some market component forces here in Phoenix as well, the whole industry is struggling right now, in fact, one of our biggest competitors, quote-unquote, we're not nearly as big as they are, but as we grow and ramp up, they will become one of our direct competitors, they're having to lay off 13 people, so they're having to lay off So Land development has slowed down primarily due to the interest rate environment that we're in, so homebuilders, they're burning through their product that they have ready for market, the sale, but they're not really starting anything new as they sit on the sidelines and sit on their cash, waiting for better times to come, specifically in the interest rate environment. So we're, we're a new business. We, if we hadn't gone through those trials and tribulations of about a year ago, about 10 months ago, we'd be sitting on a good pot of cash that would get us through a difficult time, but that's not the way it turned out. So right now we're putting out a ton of bids. We've got, we've got a lot of interest. We're just not able to turn those bids into accepted contracts. And, uh, at this moment, I'm not entirely sure why, you know, the, a lot of the landings, developers here in town, they establish relationships and they've got those built in relationships where they, they will. Some of these guys bid one trade for each item, and we're not one of those bidders until we work our way somehow into that, but that takes personal relationships, that takes previous experience with the people, it's all about personal relationships, this isn't like a residential situation where a homeowner or a GC or a real estate agent goes out to Facebook and looks for the concrete guy in their neighborhood, that's not what these guys do. What these guys do is they stick with the known quantity that they've worked with before, and they generate relationships, and then they get into a situation where they have a stable of maybe one, two, or at most three different trades in any one scope item, and that's who they'll bid, and to this point, we haven't really been able to break into that to an extent necessary to turn some of these proposals into contracts, so I would say my biggest need right now as an organization, is we need to understand, understand. And why we're not getting these bids accepted and address that, whether that means having to drop our bids. I've actually heard of our biggest competitor who just had to lay off 13 people. They're bidding projects with no margin. So they're basically, just to stay afloat, they're having to bid projects without any profit in them at all. So that'll give you a sense on where you need to be on your bids. We have in the recent past, we've come to a state where we're not going to get down much lower on overhead. I am only paying one person right now, and that's the only single person who's critical that we can't survive without. And he's putting together the bids, and I have cut this down to the very, very bone. But having said that, that's on the cost side. We now need the revenue side to pick up. So, thank you.

19:57 - Mekaiel Abdullahi
That was a lot. I would like to... Ask a little bit more about the bid process and what that person does and how that looks for you, just from like a complete outbatter, what does that, what does it entail to put together a bid, or what does that look like?

20:16 - Michael Kocourek
With any company, the software they use sometimes varies, but they get a set of plans, which are usually 24-inch by 36-inch shape in PDFs that are exported from a CAD drawing software, typically AutoCAD, they pull those into a secondary application where they can go and they mark out stuff, and that software application takes the quantities that they've identified, whether it be per each, or per square foot, or per square yard, or whatever, it exports those quantities, and then those quantities, we take them manually into an Excel spreadsheet where we itemize them, and then we assign a dollar per unit, a dollar amount per unit, and then that... Excel spreadsheet calculates the bottom line, and that's the proposal that we put out.

21:04 - Trent Christopher (40 Hero)
About how long does it take to put out a bid? I mean, it probably scales based on the size of the project.

21:11 - Michael Kocourek
yeah, we have some projects that have 135 pages worth of plans, and our estimator has to go through each page and make sure that he's not missing anything, but then we have other projects that are two pages. So it's all over the board, and I would say the time it takes to create a bid is directly related to the number of sheets that our guy has to go through. Can you give me an idea what that time range might be? Oh, we put out bids in two hours, we put out bids in a week.

21:40 - Trent Christopher (40 Hero)
Okay, so all right, two hours to a week, roughly, depending on the scale of the project. Would you say, could you put like a norm on it, like it's mostly three days or?

21:50 - Michael Kocourek
I'd have to, that process until recently has been fairly opaque to me. I haven't been really involved in that. Yeah. Until recently, I'd have to have David, our VP of Operations, give us his take on how long it's taking him to generate an average bid, but I have seen, just anecdotally, I've seen requests for bids come out, and in many cases, he's getting them done in a day or two.

22:19 - Trent Christopher (40 Hero)
Okay, so do you think that there's a time component related to winning the bid?

22:25 - Michael Kocourek
Oh, there surely is, but I mean, like yesterday, he sent out a bid that wasn't due until January 6th. So we're getting bids out really quick. We're getting our bids in front of our potential clients, probably earlier than just about anybody else. So we're not really, in that sense, we're not really butting up against a limiting factor.

22:47 - Mekaiel Abdullahi
I'm just not entirely sure why our bids are not getting accepted. Do you know what goes into the evaluation of the bid? I mean, obviously, there has to be. I, yeah, I do first.

22:59 - Michael Kocourek
It's five years. I to do this, is you take all the bids that you got, assuming that you have multiple bids, you level them, which means you ensure that everybody is quoting the same stuff, and the same stuff is what you need them to quote, so there's a leveling process where they go through and they confirm what everybody has on their individual quantities, make sure that they're more or less in line, and then they will typically, if it's a complicated project, they'll typically reach out with an RFI, or not an RFI, but a, , I can't. I can't remember the terminology, but they'll issue a directive that tells you if everybody's missed something, then they'll say, they'll send out to each bidder, hey, everybody missed this, make sure you add this and give us an updated bid, but generally speaking, concrete bids are pretty simple with somebody who knows what they're doing, so we really haven't had much of that case, our guy has been doing it for 40 years, and he picks up everything on the plans that he needs to, so we're generally in the case of just sending out our preliminary bid, and that usually is, as long as the, as long We'll now. If plans are the latest current bid set that the client gives us, that's usually what we go with. Got it. I don't recall many cases unless they have revisions to the plans where we got to look through it again and try to compare and see what is new on the new set of plans that wasn't existing or changed from previous sets. We usually don't have any revisions that we have to do. Got it.

24:22 - Mekaiel Abdullahi
Do you have an idea of how many bids you guys proposed in like the last 90 days and how many turned into contracts or any way to kind of track those numbers? Yeah, I don't.

24:34 - Michael Kocourek
I'm driving right now. I don't have that. I'd have to go through, look, look at our bid tracker and see. But within primary, we usually put all those bids in the bid tracker. I've got to get caught up on that. I'm a little bit overdue, but I would say in the last 90 days, I'd have to ask David. Okay.

24:52 - Mekaiel Abdullahi
I see most of these bids go out.

24:54 - Michael Kocourek
My feeling is that we're probably talking about 20, maybe 15 to 20 in the last 90 Got it.

25:02 - Mekaiel Abdullahi
And to your best guess, what about the bid? Is the problem, is it submitting the bid or getting them approved? That's your biggest bottleneck.

25:11 - Michael Kocourek
The problem is turning our bids into contracts, which means that our problem is getting our prospective clients to go with us as opposed to somebody else. But, but, here is a wild card that I don't know the metrics on, is a lot of these, I used to be the guy sending out four bids. And I can tell you that a lot of times they'll send out bids with, for whatever reason, with no intention of accepting the bid. Whether they want to double check on their normal guys that they bid all the time, they just want to have a sanity check to make sure that they're in the ballpark. Or they're doing budget bids, which they, they're trying to decide, should we even buy this property of land, or this parcel of land, we need to know how much it's going to cost to develop it. So they will come at you and they won't tell you every time. You just got to look through the plans and see how the plan. us Thank Preliminary, in that case, if the plans are preliminary, it's likely that they got a budget bid and not a hardcore construction bid. So I am not entirely sure why we're not getting bids turned into actual contracts. We've had a couple. We've had a few, but just not enough to sustain us. Got it. Matthew, Kevin?

26:21 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Yeah, I'm just curious if you guys have a follow-up process where once you submit a bid, do you reach out and call?

26:32 - Trent Christopher (40 Hero)
Yeah, we, it's not formalized.

26:35 - Michael Kocourek
Chris knows this better than anybody. It's not really formalized. I just, I simply need to get, we have a subscription to Microsoft Studio, and my understanding is there's CRM software in there. We just need to, we just need to pull the trigger on a CRM package and just go, whether it be, and I, I used to do that through Outlook, just to save money. I would, I would just put a tickler reminder, a task in there, an Outlook, and it would pop.

27:04 - Trent Christopher (40 Hero)
And I think that's a good point that Matthew brought up is like, is there anything that can happen either on the front end of the bidding or the back end of after you've submitted a bid to be able to follow up and then looking for opportunities to get feedback, right? And I know you mentioned you're don't already have, you don't have any feedback from the people that are doing the bids, but Oh, well, well, that's not entirely true.

27:29 - Michael Kocourek
We'd do have some feedback, but we don't have a formal mechanism where after a week, for example, after a week of sending out a bid, we follow up. Mostly, mostly what it's been is we talk amongst ourselves and we say, Hey, whatever happened to that bid? And then typically it'll be David because he's the one everybody knows. David will pick up the phone and call and say, how, what did, what'd you think about that bid? And sometimes he'll get information and sometimes they won't answer. So we're, I think we, we do get some feedback on our bid, uh, just by either Whether they reach out to us, or we reach out to them, but we don't have a formalized way, and what I've always done, like I said, what I've always done is just use Outlook. I mean, it's already on my computer, I don't have to spend any money on it, and it's just, it works fine for the extent of outreach that I need to do.

28:17 - Trent Christopher (40 Hero)
Yeah, the bidding process, when you're doing all your estimations, does that cost any money, or is it just labor? It's labor. Okay.

28:28 - Michael Kocourek
Well, there's, we have a subscription that's, I don't remember, Chris, how much was that, that house prescription, was that like $700 a year?

28:37 - Chris Andrade
$750 a year, yeah. Yeah, so we're talking about $65 a month.

28:43 - Trent Christopher (40 Hero)
Okay.

28:45 - Mekaiel Abdullahi
Got it. And Michael, for, go ahead, Chris, go ahead. No. Okay, so I was just going to say. Okay, so yeah, go ahead, Michael.

28:54 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
I had a follow-up question, just on the bid follow-up. Just to dig in a tiny bit more, is there something in your mind that's, like, you could point out as, like, a reason or, like, something that's been stopping you from turning on that software? Or, like, is it unclear how the software is supposed to work? Or anything stopping you from...

29:20 - Trent Christopher (40 Hero)
Oh, no. Like I said, I would use Outlook.

29:23 - Michael Kocourek
I used to do this when I was in land development. I I would use Outlook for all of my, quote, unquote, CRM. It wasn't customers. It was, like, And, hey, are you done with those plans yet? You told me you were going to be done on January 12th. It's January 13th. Where are those plans? So I'm very familiar. I'm not going to get into the details, but I've been kind of off on the sidelines for a little bit of time dealing with my own personal stuff. So it's just a matter of me not having the bandwidth to get that up and running and to get as completely online with David as I need to be. Okay.

29:59 - Mekaiel Abdullahi
Okay. Thank you for the insight, Michael. I just wanted to ask about the issue of conversion of these bids. know you're driving, and you don't just estimate and ballpark per month, how much money would you say is costing you losing those conversions? How much money it's costing to do the bidding?

30:20 - Michael Kocourek
No.

30:22 - Mekaiel Abdullahi
How much are you losing by not getting those bids converted?

30:28 - Michael Kocourek
Oh, God, I'd have to look through our bid tracker, but hundreds of thousands, hundreds of thousands a quarter.

30:38 - Chris Andrade
Can I add a component here, Mike, that I would like to be aware of as well? In our business, right, the overhead is kind of divided up into two, right? But if it regreses into isn't bids. our score, folks, Are at We know it's kind of hard to gauge what we're losing revenue by not having a follow up because our bids can go from $200,000 to $7 million, right? It's just kind of the barrier is so high. What I would be curious on is the administration side of just the accountability or to what it costs Remus Development, just to be able to have that HR or, you know, system in place like we used with Kiara, you know, like how much did we spend in that aspect? Does that make sense?

31:44 - Michael Kocourek
I'm not sure what you're asking, Chris.

31:48 - Chris Andrade
But our administrative costs that we have spent, right? Like the total amount of that. Can somebody help me make sense of this here? What I'm trying to say?

31:59 - Mekaiel Abdullahi
No, It's kind of hard to quantify, right? But I think what he's trying to say, Michael, is how much money is it costing you on the admin side or the administration side to put the bid in and get that converted? I mean, obviously, I think the more work you put into it on the front side and then understand why or why not it did well or it didn't do well is kind of a key aspect to me, I feel like. But what I was trying to say, if you can quantify it, how much, like, if you can put a number on how much it's you're losing by not tracking that.

32:35 - Michael Kocourek
Well, we're not losing anything by not tracking it. If we track it, that's not going to turn any more contracts. Are you talking about follow up, like customer follow up?

32:44 - Mekaiel Abdullahi
Oh, I couldn't.

32:46 - Michael Kocourek
I have no idea. If we had better customer follow up, we might get the answers on why they're not accepting our bids. There's no way to quantify that. They might just tell us, if I followed up with everybody that we put a bid out to. They might all say, you know what, we didn't go forward with that project, in which case we haven't lost any money. Or they might say a combination of, oh, no, we issued a contract, in which case, yeah, we lost that contract, but I don't think that's all of them. It would be really hard to say without actually instituting our CRM and having full coverage of response to figure out the cost implicated with not having a very good follow-up system. But the cost, the cost to implement, implement a good follow-up system is zero. So just, I just need to get on Outlook and start doing it. That's basically, I just need to do it.

33:40 - Mekaiel Abdullahi
Yeah, makes sense. And you guys said you guys were not using a CRM at this moment or no? You guys said you did have one, right? I don't.

33:47 - Michael Kocourek
Well, I talked to Microsoft and they said our subscription to 365 has a CRM, but I, I'm not a fan of getting cutesy. I'm a fan of keeping it very simple. And I, I, I. I fear if I was to start using a CRM that has a lot of bells and whistles and confusing, my VP of operations is not going to use it. He is, he's not a tech guy, I need to divvy that work up with him, so I'm thinking just simply setting up tasks in Outlook, he knows how to use Outlook, barely, but setting that up, and I hope he's not on the phone, I don't want to be talking crap about him when he's not able to defend himself, but he's just, he's an old school guy. He's a, he's a concrete guy from 40 years ago, and I don't expect him to be good with the computer, but I want to have a system that he can jump on and start using along with me, and if we set up tasks, we can share tasks, and we both know what has been done at the click of a mouse, so. Okay.

34:46 - Mekaiel Abdullahi
Can you tell me a bit about Christmas and the takeoff process, and how much, like, money you guys spent on that, and kind of that, that process?

34:57 - Michael Kocourek
Well, that's, that's a hard thing to quantify. So we have one guy that does all the bids, and I pay him $3,500 a week, but he also is a superintendent managing projects out in the field where his costs are absorbed by the contract that we're working under. So we do have his salary boiled into contracts that we do as a superintendent. So he's got two hats on. He's got a superintendent hat for projects that we have in the field, and then if he doesn't have a project to work on, he sits at his computer during the day and puts together bids. So we pay him $3,500. So I guess what I would say to you is divide how many bids we do every week, divide that into $3,500, and then you'll see how many dollars per bid we're putting in, assuming he's not working as a superintendent, because if he's working as a superintendent, his cost is paid for by our revenue.

35:51 - Mekaiel Abdullahi
Got it. And if I had a magic wand, how would you solve your big community? There's two components to that.

36:06 - Michael Kocourek
One is I need to get out and get our marketing information in front of every swing-in you-know-what in town that has any decision-making power over land development staffing, and then I also need to get back in touch with the people we put bids together with, like we've just been talking, and find out why we're not getting those bids, whether it be they're deciding not to go forward with the project because it whether doesn't pencil, or whether they had somebody that was cheaper than us, or a better relationship than us, being able to get more coverage of people and understanding in those cases where they do not accept our bid, why they're not doing that. Okay.

36:47 - Trent Christopher (40 Hero)
Are there, are there options, or are there, where's the, where do these people hang out? Like, where do you make these connections other than, like, you drive around? You to work sites.

37:01 - Michael Kocourek
Primarily, drive around to work sites. see a motor grader out there, and you know somebody's doing work. You go and you ask for the foreman or the superintendent. You talk to them that way. I also, I worked in land development and home building for a while, so I know a lot of those people personally. So I've reached out to them. We have a capital partner behind the scenes who has a long history in brokerage and land development, and he's brought in some contacts that he has. And we're just trying to, in many cases, we've got them to request bids from us. In some cases, we're still working on that.

37:36 - Trent Christopher (40 Hero)
Are they, were, if they don't have a contact in their book, what would they do? Like if they didn't know who, or if they ran out of options, where would they go? Would they start Googling people like a consumer board?

37:49 - Michael Kocourek
No, no, no, no, no, These land development guys would never Google somebody. I would venture to say they'll never run out of people. What could happen is they might. You find that all their, all the trades that they like working with are too busy to get on their schedule in time, in which case they would either know somebody else, this is a very small industry, if you work in land development in Phoenix, you know every concrete vendor, you know every asphalt vendor, you know every wet utilities vendor, you might not know them personally, but you've heard of their business, they would just either ask a buddy who they would use, or they would just start picking up the phone, and if you call somebody at a company like ours, and if you say, hey, I'm a land developer, I need somebody to bid on concrete, people are going to listen, so they, they're not going to have any problems going out and finding somebody to bid their project.

38:39 - Chris Andrade
Hey Mike, real quick, when you were a land developer, what did you use Procore and CoConstruct for? Would that be a long in your process to find contractors? really. No. No.

38:52 - Michael Kocourek
We wouldn't use any of that. That, that kind of software is more for a general contractor to manage a project. That's not so much for us. us. I don't know of any land developers that own their own license for that. Usually, the general contractor will give their clients licenses so that they can upload revisions to files and make sure that the field has everything latest and greatest, but no land developer would ever pay for that on their own. Gotcha.

39:18 - Chris Andrade
And I'm going to add to Makaiel's question about the magic wand. If you had a magic wand that was able to eliminate automated tasks in just the administrative side alone, what would that look like? If you had to know, if you can build any kind of tool just to take over the administrative, your daily daunting task, what does that look like?

39:43 - Michael Kocourek
I'm trying to figure out a task that I'd be willing to let over into. I'm not sure. I just do. I do accounting. I do accounting. I do. I send out invoices and I follow up on invoices that are overdue and paid and QuickBooks does the majority. I don't know. You know the workflow, Chris. What would you, what kind of aspects of what I do do you think would be susceptible to automation?

40:12 - Chris Andrade
I wish I could have a calendar where I can implement or have something implement that gives you to give a follow-up schedule, right? Of literally a day-by-day list of phone calls that you can make ultimately to solidify these relationships at the end of the day, right? That's, that would be a really cool component to help you manage your time and ultimately know what the day ahead of you has. And then you can ultimately plan other things around that in the same time.

40:50 - Michael Kocourek
Well, you're talking, you're talking like CRM. Well, that's yeah. Like I said, I'd buy, I'd just use Outlook for that. I mean, it's free. I don't, I don't even have to spend money on that.

41:00 - Chris Andrade
You might be asking you back to implement that.

41:07 - Michael Kocourek
Like I said, I have been otherwise occupied with other personal issues over the last couple of months, and I haven't gotten around to it.

41:15 - Chris Andrade
Okay. Okay.

41:17 - Trent Christopher (40 Hero)
So if that, for any reason, could sort of run itself based on you submit a bid, and it were to automatically give you a reminder in your calendar to schedule a follow-up, that would be helpful.

41:37 - Michael Kocourek
Yeah, that's what I use Outlook for, the task and Outlook. I used to run all my, I used to work in entitlement, and I had, they used to say we have to juggle like 100 plates in the air at the time, and we have to know what's on each plate, what direction it's spinning, where it's at, how heavy it is, what color it is, et cetera, et cetera. And I would just use Outlook, and I found that was a really powerful tool for managing. Reaching out to tradesmen and reaching out to consultants and just staying on top of it. You can always set a reminder and it just pops right up on your screen at the time specified. So that to me, I know how to use that already. I'm not a really big fan of learning how to use new software, and I know that that works and I'm comfortable with it. I think that David Navarez, our estimator, I think that he will be able, it's simple enough that I think he'll be able to use it too without having a bunch of, you know, how people who don't want to get into technology, sometimes they're resistant to new things. I think that I could get over that hurdle with a simple, simple program that he's already familiar with.

42:40 - Trent Christopher (40 Hero)
If you could make the software that you're familiar with, like Outlook, if you could make it be easier to, like you haven't implemented it because there's a level of resistance there, like friction to actually implement it, right? Oh no, no. Oh, no, that's not why I haven't.

43:01 - Michael Kocourek
I don't have any problem with getting over David's resistance and stuff like that. I'll just tell him this is what he has to do. It's been more my own dealing with my own stuff and just not having the bandwidth to put the time into getting. So it's not it's not a matter of resistance. I'm not really afraid of resistance. think David knows that this is something we need to do. And he will. I'll just I'll just say this is something we have to start doing.

43:26 - Trent Christopher (40 Hero)
Yeah, I guess what I meant in that there's resistance, I meant that you there's a reason why you haven't implemented it. because there's a level of effort that's required that you are not focused on putting your time on that because you have other things that are hotter to deal with now. So I guess what I meant by resistance was the resistance of the software. Yeah, yeah. So if the tool that was in place out was easier to leverage and easier to use on a day to day basis, and it helped you through your data. Today activities, including your estimator, David, to help him stay on top of things, that would probably be, would that help?
ACTION ITEM: Set up Outlook Tasks CRM; train David; add last 2 mo bids; start follow-ups - WATCH: https://fathom.video/share/NocpjKfdp4C9yyZBbDc-Pq38GNRVas_2?timestamp=2644.9999 be worth, well, yeah, well, it's free, yeah.

44:15 - Michael Kocourek
It's something that I can do. In fact, my situation is going to be changing here in a couple days, and I'm going to free up a bunch of time so that that will probably be one of the first things I start working on is just start utilizing that platform, the Outlook platform, to start doing that, and I'll go meet with David and show him how to do it, and I suspect it'll be pretty quick, a pretty quick learning curve for him, so.

44:40 - Trent Christopher (40 Hero)
Yeah, yeah. Just trying to identify, you know, anywhere that you should be focused on, you know, the activities that bring in, bring in money, right? They bring in the revenue.

44:51 - Michael Kocourek
Yeah, I think this all goes together, being, doing the CRM type of work, making... Phone calls to those people we've got bids to, that's all part and parcel for me is just having my phone attached to my ear all day, calling up people, taking people out to lunch, establishing those relationships, letting them know that we're here. That's the first hurdle, letting them know that we exist, because we have, I'm sorry, go ahead.

45:19 - Trent Christopher (40 Hero)
You're right. Do they typically respond better to phone calls or text messages? Oh, it really depends.

45:26 - Michael Kocourek
The old school guys, they'll, they'll, uh, they'll do the phone call. Uh, younger guys will typically respond to a text. Got it.

45:36 - Trent Christopher (40 Hero)
And they typically do phone communications and then email, maybe if you have a contract, right?

45:41 - Michael Kocourek
Uh, I insist on email for certain types of things, even if it's a client, like for contracts, for sure. I'm not going to have a client send me a contract via text. So, but yeah, so like your communications across the project though, right?

45:54 - Trent Christopher (40 Hero)
So you're going to have a contract comes to your email, but like anything that's updates with the project and. Planning phases, or coordination of where to be, when, what the status is, all of those things, they're generally email.

46:09 - Michael Kocourek
No, I am mostly out of the loop for whatever reason, and I've got to circumvent this hurdle. My VP of operations who manages all the field stuff, he feels like he should keep those things out of my hair, so to speak. He doesn't think that I want to be, but I do want to be involved in those things, because that's my background, is project management. So I need to have some conversations. That's not something, that's a cultural thing that he grew up with. It's going to take me some time to get over that hurdle, but I prefer in an email, not in a text, and especially if it's planning. That way you can look back, and this guy said, oh, you told me to be there Saturday, and then you say, no, here's the email right here. I told you to be there Friday, you know, so. Yeah, yeah, all good stuff.

47:00 - Trent Christopher (40 Hero)
I mean, there's always opportunities to try to take these things that are mundane and things that you do on a repetitive basis, there's always an opportunity that we can relieve you of some of that. So we're just trying to ask questions that help.

47:21 - Michael Kocourek
Well, I think Chris probably had a bead on if there's any avenue that is a low hanging, fruit to this. Well, I don't even know if I'd call it low hanging fruit because there's serious challenges to this as well as just the bid process, automating bids. Now, my concern with that is I haven't had a chance to ask my questions, but the automated bid, you can imagine if a bid has a number transposed, you could be 10 times off and you're bidding a $4 million project at $400,000 and you just lost $3.6 million. So our bids going going out have. Yeah. To be very, very, very sound and accurate, and I just, I guess, Chris, explain to me a little bit, I don't know how you get there with AI. I just, I don't know how you get to a level of confidence in your bids where you're willing to roll the dice on millions worth of dollars by letting a computer do it. You guys have to prove me or explain to me how that works.

48:23 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
I think a lot of the misconception is that people think it's going to be fully automated with AI. I think for one thing I was thinking of is like, if there's 135 page bid thing, or if there's 135 pages of stuff to go through, and you have a process of going through that, but it just takes a lot of time. Then one thing we could potentially do is set up that process where the AI can do a bunch of that quickly, but then it still needs. human to review and do the quality assurance layer, but it just, and that might still take a lot of time, but there's.

49:10 - Michael Kocourek
that, yeah, that, the problem with that is it doesn't save any time at all, because if he has to review the bid that's put out, he has to go through and do his full bid takeoff, which is what he would have done anyway, simply to verify a number that a computer gave us. So I don't know how you, how you save any time by doing that. I that's like way down the road.

49:32 - Chris Andrade
Right. We're very scratching the surface. I'm just like just the CRM side and the follow up. Right. I think we'll this. Yeah. We're, we're talking like way software development processes down the road. We're just, we're, we're buried here to kind of just ultimately understand your pain points specifically better.

49:54 - Mekaiel Abdullahi
Yeah.

49:55 - Michael Kocourek
Well, if you go back, I think it's just revenue, revenue, revenue, revenue. We need to. Thank you. Figure out a way to get more revenue coming in the door.

50:03 - Trent Christopher (40 Hero)
Revenue is an outcome that is based on the inputs or the response to the inputs. So trying to figure out what inputs are going to be the best levers for you.

50:16 - Michael Kocourek
Well, the bid is the primary work product that results in bid review, obviously. And then it's a matter, I think, there's a lot of merit in me just biting the bullet and taking a day to get everybody up to speed on Outlook and starting to put every new bid we put in there. And even the old bids, go back and look through the last two months of bids and add a new task for each one and then just start calling and just start using that and getting familiarized with it. And that's something that I think I can implement next week, even with the holiday and everything.

50:51 - Trent Christopher (40 Hero)
Do you guys have, if you were to look at your bid sheet that... If goes all of your bids, do you think there's any value or do you have a process or do you have at least like some time that you go back and review it to see if there's anything that stands out to you that like, oh man, crap, why did we put that number there? Or why did we deliver the bid to them then? Like just sort of some things to sort of evaluate yourself to try to understand it better.

51:28 - Michael Kocourek
Well, I can tell you for myself, I review every cell formula. I eyeball every cell formula. I eyeball, I double check that every number that has been cranked out of the takeoffs software, I have included it correctly. I double check every unit cost that goes in there. I double check every, it's a very simple calculation. It's basically a multiplication and addition. That's it. Okay.

51:51 - Trent Christopher (40 Hero)
Maybe I, yeah, maybe, um, in my question, um, I was thinking more like the, sorry, not the bid sheet. I use the wrong term. Yeah. The bid tracker, like basically the list of all your bids that you've been putting out that tells you like the results and how much they were, if there was an opportunity to go back and review that, to try to identify any gaps that maybe something got missed, or maybe there's like, maybe all the low bids are going through, but the high ones aren't. like trying to find characteristics that are, or patterns in the...

52:25 - Michael Kocourek
Yeah, that, my initial inclination, I used to work as a data management guy in the oil field for a lot of years. And my first inclination is to say, absolutely, we need, there's a ton of missing data in there. It's just that we haven't really had a chance to, to refine that, that document as new ideas come up and as new things come clear to us that, hey, this would be very useful to having that bid tracker. I just need to, I just need to refine it, simplify it a lot. There's a lot, of stuff in there that's just not of importance, but add a couple things, take out a lot of stuff. And for it to be as useful as it possibly could be, there's a there's a bit of work, but that's like spreadsheet management, you know, you're familiar with that. Yeah, yeah.

53:10 - Trent Christopher (40 Hero)
And I'm just thinking like, have you guys ever looked at the sheet and been like, oh, man, like, just sort of noticed, just looking back at some of the results that you've been getting in your bids list, regardless of whether or not the columns are what you think need to be there. Or I'm just wondering if there's ever been an aha moment in reviewing that bid tracker saying, crap.

53:36 - Michael Kocourek
No, no, if I spent a lot of time looking through it, I might come to some kind of aha conclusion. But the only thing I will tell you right now is aside from one case, we just have not been able to get in with home home builders. There's something about home builders, and I suspect that's because most home builders have their established relationships that they. I'd like to go to, and there's people out in the field who have a lot of say on who they bring on board, so I think that, I suspect but do not know that our inability to penetrate the homebuilding market is mostly due to their lack of familiarity with us, but that's, I think that would be borne out by a quick look, but there's a lot of work that, there's like, there's literally like 15 different colors specifying the status of bids, which is way too many. I need to boil it down to simplify it a little bit just to make sure that, you know, you can look at it and understand what, what the status is.

54:37 - Chris Andrade
Thank is always something we really struggled with, because we didn't really know how to like classify bids, like, ooh, do we have a really good chance with this builder? We talked, we we've been working really hard on that relationship with said builder or estimator, who are they on the builder side, the representative, Mike? Whoever. Whoever. Am Like, we're dealing with, like, what do you mean? What is our title? Yeah, like, who are we?

55:06 - Michael Kocourek
either land development project manager or land development director or VP of land. It depends on which company you're working for.

55:14 - Chris Andrade
And you literally have to, like, hey, Mike, how was your weekend? did you watch that game last weekend? It was crazy. Oh, hey, by the way, where are we sitting on that bid? Did our number come in? Anyone close? Like, that's literally how these conversations happen. And foster those relationships, right? Yeah, so I agree with you.

55:34 - Michael Kocourek
I agree with you 100%, Chris, other than I would have gotten right to the business. I wouldn't even have asked about the football. And that's probably why I have such a hard time. Yeah, yeah, and I agree, right?

55:44 - Chris Andrade
Personal touch goes a long way with these guys, I have found, right? Because then you can open up conversations, right? And you know me, Mike, that's what I'm good at, right? And I'm curious, I know we use teams. What is your, like, I would like you to share some insight on what your thoughts of Microsoft in general, because I know you're an Outlook, you love it, it sounds like you have a lot of knowledge in it, but the other tools that are involved with Microsoft, is there anything you do like, you dislike? What does that look like? Well, for Teams, I like, the only thing about Teams I like is the ability to have web conferences.

56:24 - Michael Kocourek
I don't use Teams for file management or anything. I've just got, I've got my OneDrive set up. I'm linked to my file explorer on my computer, so I can go directly to the file through my, through my tried and true file explorer. I don't have to go through Teams and all this, and I can send files, I can just like attach files, or if I want to, I can send an instance where it's not resident on their computer, but I don't find myself doing that very often. But I, I never really could get all that much of the Teams other than the web conference side of it. I'm trying to think of any other PowerPoint I used a little bit, but I find even that's pretty clunky compared to my File Explorer.

57:13 - Mekaiel Abdullahi
Michael, thank you so much. That's been really informative. Before I wrap up, I just want to ask one question. It seems like your time is a very big bottleneck, and I just want to kind of identify the three biggest actions from your day-to-day that take up most of your time.

57:29 - Michael Kocourek
Accounting, business development, and really, those are the only two things that I sit here and I do a lot of strategizing, but we're such a small company.

57:40 - Chris Andrade
What's that? Job costing, and hour tracking, and timekeeping. Well, I don't do that. Oh, who's turning in the job sheets, and where do those go, and how do those get entered into payroll? David. David. He's entering in payroll now, too? No, he's not entering.

58:03 - Michael Kocourek
takes me like a minute a week.

58:06 - Chris Andrade
Okay, so is he still taking the pictures of the sheets from the job site and sending them to you?

58:12 - Michael Kocourek
I showed him how to use a scanner on his computer, so he's scanning them in and sending them to me.

58:18 - Chris Andrade
So he's scanning them now, and then he sends them to you via email, then you put them where they need to go on your desktop? No, I don't use my desktop. I never use them.

58:27 - Michael Kocourek
I use the hard drive only. I use the Remus hard drive.

58:30 - Chris Andrade
And then you are putting it on the time sheet and then transferring the W2 versus the 1099 and putting that into the payroll software, right? You make it sound more complicated than it actually is.

58:44 - Michael Kocourek
I just go through and I put in everybody's hours and it clicks a bit. Okay, so David's not doing that part.

58:52 - Chris Andrade
You're still in control of that.

58:54 - Michael Kocourek
Yeah, I don't trust anybody else to get the, well, I would trust you, but I don't trust David. think David... And that's not, that's not his, that's not his job.

59:03 - Chris Andrade
Yeah. Yeah. Okay. I was just, I was just wanting to make sure and clarification. That's all. Sorry, Michael, I heard accounting and what else was it?

59:12 - Mekaiel Abdullahi
What was the second and third thing? Just business development. There really isn't.

59:16 - Michael Kocourek
I, I spend a lot of time thinking about business strategy, but we're too small to be worried about all those, those other high. We need to, we need to get the fundamentals right before we, we start walking. We're, we're, we're still working on a crawl. So I do a lot of reading on, uh, contracting fundamentals and, uh, some of this stuff. I'm a civil engineer. Well, I'm technically, I'm a petroleum engineer by background. I worked in the oil field for plenty of years as an engineer, but I'm, I'm, I'm more solid on the numbers and the spreadsheets and the, and the checklists and stuff like that. So, um, that's usually what I, if I have a spare time, I usually go through and think of how can we improve our processes. And, you know, talking about roles and responsibilities, what does each person have to do in this business, so everybody knows what they're doing, that kind of thing, business strategy. Absolutely.

1:00:11 - Mekaiel Abdullahi
Matthew, I know you had your hand up, and Chris, I'll let you go as well.

1:00:15 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Yeah, I had a quick question around, because you mentioned that you're going to need to train people on how to use Outlook. And I know you mentioned you want to have one person do it, but then how many people are you going to need to show how to use Outlook? Because I think you said everybody at one point. Well, one. One person. For now, okay.

1:00:36 - Michael Kocourek
Yeah, we're a long ways away from needing an estimator, a full-time estimator.

1:00:44 - Trent Christopher (40 Hero)
One more question, it's just sort of a follow-up to something that we were talking about earlier, is that your estimator slash supervisor for the projects, right? Superintendent, yeah. Yeah, superintendent. Thank you. you. you. Do you have any idea on, like, what the division is? Like, how, is it 50-50? Like, he roughly spends half of his time in the field and half of the time doing it? Oh, that's very cyclic.

1:01:10 - Michael Kocourek
Like, the last two weeks, we've worked two days in the field. So in the last two weeks, it's been, what, four out of 10, so 40%. No, two out of 10, 20%. But some other weeks when we actually have, we're looking like we might have three projects in January. So his time is going to be more devoted to being out in the field and monitoring his crews and less on the bid production.

1:01:39 - Trent Christopher (40 Hero)
So who's going to do the bids when he takes the supervisory role? He will. He works after hours on bids.

1:01:46 - Michael Kocourek
So he goes out, he gets up early in the morning, he goes out to the field, he gets the guys squared away, and then he goes back home and does the bids in the afternoon.

1:01:53 - Trent Christopher (40 Hero)
Does he get paid extra for doing that when he's... No, no. No. okay. Nope, he's on salary. Got it. Hey, Mike, I just wanted to ask a quick question.

1:02:04 - Chris Andrade
When it comes down to job costing, which is something I feel we always struggled with, do you have like a vision, a plan, an execution of what you would think, how that would look to collect the data needed for job costing, and ultimately knowing how much we spent on the job? Oh, yeah, that's, yeah, that's very rudimentary.

1:02:25 - Michael Kocourek
I talked with David about that the other day, and I just made sure he understands he's in charge of, the problem is we got to get a job that has a good amount of quantities to job costs. Right. we have a couple projects coming up where we're going to get good usable data, and I've let him know in certain terms that he's in charge of directing his people to record that data that we need out in the field.

1:02:49 - Chris Andrade
And in our experience, we've lost because pretty much at end of the day, no one wants to fill out the sheet, turn it in. By the end of the day, they wait until Friday, and they collect it. Write their notes from their notebook on Friday and consolidate, right? So we always had a tough time getting quality job daily reports just because of that fact, right? Well, that's the nature of the game, unfortunately, with these guys out in the field.

1:03:19 - Michael Kocourek
They're typically just, they're workers. They're people who like to labor with their hands. And it's going to be, there's going to be a growing pain associated with getting them to start recording this. But I'm at the point where if you don't ship up, you're going to shape out. Oh, no, wait. If you don't shape up, you're going to ship out. I'm not tolerating any more half-assery around here. We don't have, we don't have the ability to tolerate half-assery. So I'm going to work in a perfect IP world.
ACTION ITEM: Update timesheet template to include daily production notes - WATCH: https://fathom.video/share/NocpjKfdp4C9yyZBbDc-Pq38GNRVas_2?timestamp=3826.9999

1:03:48 - Chris Andrade
Like, are you talking like daily reportings, weekly reportings? What does that look like? No, I'm talking about on the timesheet, they write what they have accomplished in that day.

1:03:57 - Michael Kocourek
So we'll adjust. The timesheet to have some area where they can write down their production for that day, and then you look at how many people were there, how many man-hours, and you divide that out by the man-hours. And then the accountability side of that, like how do you plan on holding them in trouble? You don't do this, you're fired. Yep, right, at the end of the day, right?

1:04:24 - Chris Andrade
Yeah, okay.

1:04:25 - Trent Christopher (40 Hero)
Thank you. Thanks, Michael. We really appreciate your time. Yeah, no problem. We're rounding around to an hour here. I do want to at least give everybody an opportunity if they have like one last thing they want to ask. But generally speaking, an hour is probably a good time to start wrapping it up. Appreciate your time, though. Oh, yeah, no problem. Thank you. I appreciate you guys.

1:04:47 - Michael Kocourek
Sounds like you got something really interesting percolating and working on. Yeah, we're looking just to help.

1:04:53 - Trent Christopher (40 Hero)
So we're just trying to, you know, ask you questions and try to find ways that we can help you guys out. Yeah, I would love to have.

1:05:00 - Michael Kocourek
I some help, but like I said at the beginning, our main issue right now is getting dollars coming in on APs, or I'm sorry, ARs, accounts receivable. We're just not getting the projects we need to sustain. Well, if I had known a year ago what I know now, our situation would be drastically different. I wouldn't have overspent on unnecessary labor and unnecessary office people, but you live and you learn. We're still around. We still got enough money to be dangerous next year, so I'm just, I'm all hands-on trying to figure out how do we get more people to be aware that we're here and what we do, and then on the other side, do that follow-up and find out if we're not getting bids accepted, what is the primary reason or reasons.
ACTION ITEM: Review transcript; draft proposal; schedule follow-up w/ Michael - WATCH: https://fathom.video/share/NocpjKfdp4C9yyZBbDc-Pq38GNRVas_2?timestamp=3941.9999 All right.

1:05:49 - Mekaiel Abdullahi
That was super insightful, Michael. Thank you so much. What will happen next is we'll get back together with the team. We'll go analyze the transcripts, see how we can help you. We'd like to schedule a follow-up, I know it's the holidays, and come back with a proposal, see if we can, how we like, how we've been doing it is offering like a quick win solution, and then, but how we usually like to work, as you can tell, like, there's a lot to digest, right, and we usually like to engage with clients on a longer-term basis, just through an audit process, and then like an implementation process, but right now, I think we have to talk internally, obviously, but what we'd love to do is just schedule a follow-up, and see if we can, figure out a way to help you out.

1:06:31 - Michael Kocourek
Yeah, crunch over what we've talked about today, and if you, if you find some low-hanging fruit that you think that you can help on, I'm, I'm all ears trying to figure out how to, how to, you know, make enough money to keep this business going.

1:06:46 - Mekaiel Abdullahi
I need anything else, Trent, Matthew, Chris? Matthew?

1:06:52 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
No, I think I'm good, I just, I wanted to mention that I think with the existing softwares that you guys have, um, It's, yeah, it's ideal when we get started if we, like, we don't want to build something brand new if you guys aren't going to use it. So any information we have about your current softwares, I think we went over a lot of it already, though. So, but just figure it out. Yeah. So I do have one more question.

1:07:21 - Trent Christopher (40 Hero)
was kind of wondering, you mentioned that you still have a little bit of money that you can be dangerous for next year. So what does next year look like? I mean, I know you, you obviously are focused on trying to bring in more revenue, but do you have any feel or perception on what could be the result of next year?

1:07:41 - Michael Kocourek
Yeah, well, we've got three projects coming up in the beginning of the year that are already under our belt, or, well, they're already committed. And that is going to be something on the order of, let me think. That's probably going to be about 25% of our overall revenue from this year, plus we have two projects that, Chris understands this, but we bid to general contractors sometimes, and they have to get their general contract bid approved, accepted, before they can then issue their subcontracts. We've got two subcontracts that if we get both of them, those two jobs themselves will more than beat our entire revenue for this year. So I'm just, based on the capital that I have sitting in the bank, I actually had to get some financing. It's primarily working capital so that if we do get those big projects awarded, we have the money to pay our guys while we're waiting for our clients to pay us back. So, it's, it could be a very exciting year, I know a lot of people I talk with in the industry, they think that this is going to be the year where it picks up. Now, none of them, just like back in 08, I don't know. If you guys were around, I was around real estate in 08, and everybody had an opinion and they were all wrong. So I'm not holding my breath, but there's a lot of guys who should know what the next year is going to hold who are pretty optimistic. So we'll see when we get there. But from our books, it looks like we have some pretty exciting stuff coming up. Yeah, that's awesome. That's awesome. Yeah, thank you for your time, Mike.

1:09:27 - Trent Christopher (40 Hero)
I appreciate it. Yeah, no problem, guys. Mike, I just want to close out.

1:09:30 - Michael Kocourek
Like, Mike, you know I love you, man.

1:09:33 - Chris Andrade
And, you know, you've been a mentor of mine that I honestly genuinely appreciate. And, yeah, constructive criticism comes at its finest when I'm working with you. So I appreciate it.

1:09:46 - Michael Kocourek
Hopefully it's always viewed as constructive. My wife tells me that I don't have a good bedside manner. I tend to be very abrupt and to the point. So my apologies if I ruffled anybody's feathers. That's just my I've much older since January, so I get it.

1:09:59 - Mekaiel Abdullahi
No.

1:10:00 - Chris Andrade
I love you, buddy, and I'm just happy that I'm able to bring these guys to you and show you what we're capable of, because there's a bigger play, and I can't wait to kind of take a loop to that kind of stuff. So, yeah, good moment for all of us, and, yeah, man, looking forward to this. Yep, yep.

1:10:18 - Michael Kocourek
Arrange something when you guys have had a chance to mull over and digest and kind of come up with some ideas and arrange something, and we'll talk again. Thanks, Mike. Yep, take care.

1:10:29 - Mekaiel Abdullahi
Take care, all. Bye.

1:10:31 - Michael Kocourek
Bye. Bye.
