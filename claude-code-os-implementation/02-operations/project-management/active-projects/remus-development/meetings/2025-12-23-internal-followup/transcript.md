## Transcript

@Chris Andrade [0:05]: Exception That went really well, man. That went really well. I'm actually

@Trent [0:12]: Yes,

@Chris Andrade [0:13]: Yeah, I, he Dude is one of the smartest guys I think I've ever really met. He's just You know.

@Trent [0:24]: Yeah, I mean, he, it sounds like, you know, he's he's skeptical of the technology being able to help him with a lot of different things, right? He's just used to doing it the way he's been doing it. He's just used to going through the rhythm and going through the steps, and then that's just how it is, right? That for him, that's what it is. I think there's, you know, a lot more opportunity that we probably didn't even surface, to be honest, that in his daily work, like everything he does throughout the day or the week

@Chris Andrade [0:41]: Mhm Mhm

@Trent [0:54]: That can be helped. It's just like we couldn't get him to speak to the actual details, yeah.

@Chris Andrade [0:58]: Right. OK And I got I do guys, I got will we ever get out of this? I got what I know he needs, and then we'll talk about those and present that, like we have more than surface level here. I'm just glad that we got like more of a better surface honestly than I anticipated. If I'm being real, so that's really cool. And then yeah, I, that went way better than I anticipated. If I'm being 100% honest. So again,

@Trent [1:28]: Yeah.

@Chris Andrade [1:30]: Dude, you guys, this is awesome, like I've, I haven't heard him sound like that in a long time, if I'm being honest, so I, I think you guys said that.

@Trent [1:40]: And like what? What did he sound like?

@Chris Andrade [1:43]: Just calm and collective and precise, like he was that engineer that I've been used to and You know, the destroys he's struggling to find himself a little bit, you know what I'm saying? And he's, I'm starting to see that, right now, so it's been cool.

@Trent [2:02]: Oh Cool.

@Chris Andrade [2:04]: Yeah. Last

@Trent [2:05]: I know we don't have Mel on here, but I just want to give you guys a heads up that I'm, I'll probably be, I gotta be off here no later than 7. I

@Chris Andrade [2:13]: Yeah

@Trent [2:15]: Well, that the end of the hour, so no later than.

@Chris Andrade [2:15]: OK Yeah. Yeah. And It's crazy to me, so he is, he is denying some of the things about The job costing is an absolute.

@Chris Andrade [2:31]: Pain point, and I don't understand what he always been banging our heads against the wall about know your numbers, how much profit are we going to get in this? How much profit, David? How much profit? At the end of the day, he's correct. We don't have like the jobs that we've got in this year.

@Chris Andrade [2:52]: Because we are still establishing those relationships that he referred to those builders, right? The jobs that we were awarded were like Tearing out an intersection Removing everything, pouring everything back.

@Chris Andrade [3:09]: It's not like a traditional line item, right? We got it. There's we've been doing just piecework at the moment for other contractors because they are too busy and in order to meet their timeline, they use people like us to make sure that they're not getting their

@Chris Andrade [3:28]: Fines cause they're late or behind the schedule, so that's where we've been kind of niching in with and, and but we really haven't won a contract that we're able to associate that.

@Trent [3:32]: Yeah

@Chris Andrade [3:43]: Labor or man hour or overhead cost. For the whole contract, right? We still got or if the contracts we did win, there maybe one line item.

@Trent [3:51]: Yeah, yeah Yeah, you know, you know, you know, at the end of the day, what you got paid, and you know what you had to pay other people, but you don't know anything inside of that, right? So so that you can improve your, your bidding process, your, your estimation process so you know what things cost you. Yeah.

@Chris Andrade [4:12]: Please. And it And that's what he, he, he claims himself as like an Excel, you know, that's a niche, right? The same thing with Outlook, but for whatever reason, he's not developing what needs to be done, because I've been talking to, like you saw my proposals that I built, right? You kept drilling us about profit, profit, profit, how much, what's my margins at? And I got tired of it, so I built the goddamn spreadsheet with Manour factors to ultimately give me a calculation per line item of what our rough

@Chris Andrade [4:45]: Profit will be, right? And I have all that ready to go.

@Trent [4:49]: Yeah

@Chris Andrade [4:50]: It's like those kind of tools that he's like what he's trying to allude to would honestly help him understand just his daily, and then like the follow up, like, you know, yeah. There is a human element, that's why I wish I can give him like a calendar that he wrote or something, a way to remind them, hey, remember you need to call 8 Meridian.

@Trent [5:13]: But he's Yeah, like he's, you know, he's saying, well, all I have to do is use the tool, and that's true, but there's a reason why he's not using the tool was what I was trying to get to, right, is that the wheezing he's not using the tools because it takes too much time or it takes too much energy, or he doesn't want to click remind me or whatever, right? So,

@Chris Andrade [5:25]: 5 Or he and he like, dude, he gave me so much shit for, I wasn't gonna pay for Illustrator to be to to use on to build his like wait till you see the ship that I had to build, like all of his job sheets, time sheets, all the tracking, I all built on Illustrator. The logos, the designs.

@Chris Andrade [5:55]: And, you know, we keep needing to use it here and there, and yeah, you know, he's keeping track of costs on the credit cards and I'm like having to justify why we need Adobe. It's like, come on, look how much we're getting out of it, you know. So he's just very

@Chris Andrade [6:15]: Breaking every cent now, yeah, very, very.

@Trent [6:16]: He's nero He's, he, he's he's narrow, yeah.

@Chris Andrade [6:20]: Very

@Matthew Kerns [6:20]: Element of like he, like he has certain expertise in things that, like, ideally the company would have him working on those things that he's very good at, and not spending time clicking around and Outlook, right, and he just gets like a paper, like he said, the schedule of like, OK, let's reach out to these 10 people whenever you got 1 hour or 2 hours.

@Chris Andrade [6:42]: Yeah.

@Trent [6:42]: Yeah.

@Matthew Kerns [6:43]: Background, so he can do the Important stuff

@Chris Andrade [6:47]: OK And he thinks that he can just tell Dave, yeah, you gotta do this. No, but it ain't gonna happen, buddy, and I want to say we could now it would be a very good loom video and when I legit like the mouse would need to be a set of spun up, spun down, like going to click on this file, like legit. But David is a badass dude, like he is a badass, so, yeah, he was getting paid a shit ton of money and

@Chris Andrade [7:21]: He knew he was above market value, right? So he was willing to do those multiple hats, because he was He, he, yeah And so,

@Trent [7:38]: I mean, that's 100, that's $182,000 a year, if he's getting paid 30.

@Chris Andrade [7:41]: Bro, it was only it was 4500 up to 3 weeks ago.

@Trent [7:46]: Which is $234 a year.

@Chris Andrade [7:48]: Yeah

@Trent [7:49]: Wow, that's a lot.

@Chris Andrade [7:49]: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, and and and and so there is some faults here like luckily they will never see this conversation.

@Trent [7:52]: Yeah

@Chris Andrade [7:59]: Dave is at fault here too, right? Because Dave's requirement is his pay so high, and there's no budget, and I kind of got out of it, but at the end of the day, I know that I can't keep the company alive. He does, right? He's the one who does the concrete. So here I am, just another guy who can just push paperwork through, you know what I mean?

@Trent [8:21]: He, he's delivery, right, David? Like he's he's delivering the product. He's doing the estimate and then he delivers the service or the product, the services the product, but he delivers that, right, to the client, but the problem right now is more on the business development side of being able to make sure people know who you are and bring the opportunities and then execute on those opportunities to well enough that they

@Chris Andrade [8:24]: Yeah. Right. Right

@Chris Andrade [8:42]: That's what I was getting good good at, right? Making that outreach, but then when I had timesheets and I had payroll, and then I had to, so David, I was having to date upload David's plans, make sure David had the where to go to get on when take those after he was done and transfer him over to the takeoff, and then like,

@Trent [8:50]: I Does he print them out

@Chris Andrade [9:06]: I had Say that again

@Trent [9:07]: Does he use, he use a computer or does he print them out?

@Chris Andrade [9:11]: He uses that that house takeoff software.

@Trent [9:14]: Oh, OK. So, let's, she has some technical ability. It's not completely a death.

@Chris Andrade [9:15]: Yeah, this is Yeah, he can, he will learn it just takes maybe 4 or 5 iterations of the same process that cause he's literally like shit down.

@Matthew Kerns [9:31]: And that's where that video. The loom video would be so good if like cause Mike is gonna now go and do the outlook process, so I think we should even tell him like if he's going to spend any time doing that, he should record it so that he doesn't spend time over the next few weeks like training and retraining they.

@Chris Andrade [9:46]: Yep. I think Yep. That's when I started getting into, right? But again, it's like the time that I had to do to record the video, then upload the video, you know what I mean? And then I have phone calls calling and distractions happening. It just feels very hard to keep track of all the shit that I needed to do after a single.

@Trent [10:08]: Yeah, yeah, yeah, so.

@Chris Andrade [10:09]: I gotta go take the leap real quick. I'll be right back.

@Trent [10:12]: Yeah, so I On, on the surface, immediately. I'm not Fully clear on how to help, but

@Matthew Kerns [10:25]: Yeah. I think I kind of think they need a lot more outreach. Like one thing that we could do is Just automate All the outreach somehow, where like, He can just

@Matthew Kerns [10:42]: Talk with a chatbot and be like, these are all the people I know Help me schedule my And then like get all the information into it.

@Trent [10:50]: Yeah.

@Matthew Kerns [10:52]: Data and kind of schedule it out. For People just don't know about them, which is normal when it's A new company, like a new and they don't.

@Trent [11:09]: Yeah.

@Matthew Kerns [11:11]: Yeah.

@Trent [11:12]: Yeah, and

@Matthew Kerns [11:12]: OK

@Trent [11:14]: I think that that's why I

@Matthew Kerns [11:15]: Good

@Trent [11:17]: Losing you just a little bit, Matthew, like your, your video is cutting in and out, like getting choppy.

@Matthew Kerns [11:19]: Like Go ahead and you talk.

@Trent [11:30]: Yeah, your video is a little choppy for some reason, but So I was trying, so he's trying to sell business to business.

@Matthew Kerns [11:39]: Thank you.

@Trent [11:41]: Word of mouth is a big deal, right? So that's kind of like He feels like that's the only way to get it

@Matthew Kerns [11:47]: Yeah.

@Trent [11:50]: Is to just make phone calls, knock on doors. Maybe it's not knocking on doors, it's like really literally going to job sites, but

@Chris Andrade [11:57]: No, oh, so I wanted to touch on that, and I didn't want to do it publicly, but that is a big hunk of bullshit because I did that and I went to 4 job sites, walked up, all legit. I had my gear, hard hat, boots, the whole nine, and I go up to a job site looking for the right trailer, and now I'm a stranger onto a job site, right? Then they get pissed off.

@Trent [11:58]: I

@Chris Andrade [12:25]: Right? Cause you're looking and asking around, and then you go give him a flyer, you look like a complete schmuck, bro. And then I go find out, I go ask my other contractor buddies about how that he's like, dude, if you walked up to me, random guy, yes, you're all geared up, but you hand me a flyer, I'm gonna tear that thing in front of your face and spit on it and laugh at you until you get the fuck off my job site.

@Trent [12:52]: Yeah, yeah, that's like.

@Chris Andrade [12:53]: Because that, that's honestly like the response I got, like, Like I was not welcome. I did not feel like, oh, I was doing a good thing, and so I, but I didn't want to tell him that.

@Trent [12:59]: Yeah. Like I, I'm, I'm all, I'm all for like, looking at, looking at people as equals, But My, my lady Sierra, she gives on job sites a lot and she gets attention because she's she's beautiful. So you, you need to, maybe you need to crossdress, man.

@Chris Andrade [13:22]: Right

@Trent [13:30]: No, no, just, just not playing now.
