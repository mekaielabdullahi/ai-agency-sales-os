## Alignment with Discovery Findings

This internal discussion **confirms** key discovery findings:
1. ✅ David is not tech-savvy → Keep it simple
2. ✅ Cold outreach doesn't work in this market → Relationship-focused BD
3. ✅ No job costing system → January projects will provide data
4. ✅ Existing spreadsheets exist → Build on what they have

**New insight:** Chris has already built profit calculation spreadsheets with man-hour factors. This is an asset we didn't know about from the discovery call.
