## Michael's Core Strengths (Where He Should Spend Time)

| Strength | Evidence from Discovery |
|----------|------------------------|
| **Spreadsheet management** | "I review every cell formula. I eyeball every cell formula." |
| **Bid review & QA** | "I double check every unit cost... every number that has been cranked out" |
| **Accounting & financial tracking** | Primary responsibility, comfortable with QuickBooks |
| **Process/system design** | "I go through and think of how can we improve our processes" |
| **Strategic planning** | "Roles and responsibilities, what does each person have to do" |
| **Data management** | "I used to work as a data management guy in the oil field" |

**Key Quote:**
> "I'm more solid on the numbers and the spreadsheets and the checklists and stuff like that."

## Current Time Drains (Mundane/Repetitive Tasks)

### 1. Payroll Data Entry
**Current Process:**
- David scans timesheets on his computer
- David emails scans to Michael
- Michael manually enters hours into payroll system
- Michael separates W2 vs 1099

**Michael's Quote:** "I just go through and I put in everybody's hours and it clicks a bit"

**Time Estimate:** "Takes me like a minute a week" (but will scale with more projects)

**Automation Opportunity:**
- OCR extraction from scanned timesheets
- Auto-populate payroll system
- Human review only for exceptions

**Priority:** MEDIUM (low time now, but scales poorly)

---

### 2. Bid Follow-Up Task Creation
**Current Process:**
- Bid gets sent out
- Michael manually creates Outlook Task
- Sets reminder date
- Repeats for every bid

**Michael's Quote:** "I would just put a tickler reminder, a task in there, an Outlook, and it would pop"

**Time Estimate:** 5-10 min per bid × 15-20 bids/quarter = 1-3 hours/quarter

**Automation Opportunity:**
- When bid email is sent, auto-create Outlook Task
- Pre-set follow-up cadence (3 days, 7 days, 14 days)
- Auto-populate with bid details from email

**Priority:** HIGH (removes friction to implementing the follow-up system he knows he needs)

---

### 3. Bid Tracker Updates
**Current Process:**
- Manual spreadsheet updates
- 15+ status colors (overly complex)
- Michael is "a little bit overdue" on updates

**Michael's Quote:** "I've got to get caught up on that. I'm a little bit overdue"

**Time Estimate:** Unknown, but causes procrastination

**Automation Opportunity:**
- Auto-sync bid status from Outlook Tasks
- Reduce to 5-7 statuses
- Dashboard view instead of manual spreadsheet

**Priority:** HIGH (current complexity causes avoidance)

---

### 4. Invoice Follow-Up
**Current Process:**
- Michael sends invoices via QuickBooks
- Manually tracks overdue invoices
- Manually follows up

**Michael's Quote:** "I send out invoices and I follow up on invoices that are overdue"

**Time Estimate:** Unknown

**Automation Opportunity:**
- Automated reminder emails at 7, 14, 30 days overdue
- Escalation notifications to Michael only for exceptions
- Dashboard of AR status

**Priority:** MEDIUM (direct revenue impact)

---

### 5. Document Organization
**Current Process:**
- David scans documents
- David emails to Michael
- Michael saves to OneDrive manually

**Michael's Quote:** "I use the hard drive only. I use the Remus hard drive."

**Time Estimate:** Small per document, adds up

**Automation Opportunity:**
- Auto-file email attachments to correct OneDrive folders
- Naming convention enforcement
- Search/retrieval improvements

**Priority:** LOW (small time savings, nice-to-have)

---

### 6. BD Outreach Scheduling
**Current Process:**
- Michael manually tracks who to call
- No systematic cadence
- Relies on memory or ad-hoc reminders

**Michael's Quote:** "Phone attached to my ear all day, calling up people, taking people out to lunch"

**Time Estimate:** Significant mental overhead

**Automation Opportunity:**
- Chatbot to capture contacts and schedule follow-ups
- Auto-generate daily call list
- Track relationship warmth over time

**Priority:** HIGH (but depends on validating BD approach first)

---

## Time Freed → Where It Should Go

| Time Freed From | Reallocate To |
|-----------------|---------------|
| Bid follow-up task creation | Bid review and QA (his strength) |
| Bid tracker manual updates | Pattern analysis and strategic decisions |
| Invoice chasing | Process improvement and system design |
| BD admin overhead | Let Chris do relationship BD instead |

---

## Key Insight: Role Swap

**Current State (Suboptimal):**
- Michael: BD outreach + Admin + Accounting + Bid review
- Chris: Admin tasks (timesheets, payroll support, documents)

**Optimal State:**
- Michael: Bid review + Spreadsheet management + Accounting + Systems
- Chris: Relationship BD (bars, events, social settings)

**Automation enables this swap** by reducing Michael's admin burden so he can focus on internal operations while Chris focuses on external relationships.

---

## Implementation Approach

For Michael specifically:
1. **Keep it simple** - He's resistant to new software, prefers Outlook
2. **Build on what exists** - Enhance Outlook, don't replace it
3. **Automate the triggers** - Auto-create tasks, auto-file docs
4. **Human review for exceptions** - He still sees everything important
5. **Train with Loom videos** - If David needs training, record it once

---

## BD Enablement: Two Strategic Options

The core problem: Remus is unknown in a relationship-driven market. Land developers never Google for contractors - they rely on personal relationships and word-of-mouth.

**Key Evidence:**
- Michael: "I would have gotten right to the business. I wouldn't even have asked about the football. And that's probably why I have such a hard time."
- Chris: "If I was at a bar or something or a restaurant and I just so happened to know somebody or see somebody, then that shit is really different."
- Cold job site outreach failed (Chris tried it - hostile responses)

---

### Option A: Enable Michael to Do More BD (With Better Tools)

**Premise:** Keep Michael doing BD but remove the friction and mental overhead so he can have more quality conversations.

**What Michael Needs:**
| Need | Solution |
|------|----------|
| Know who to call today | Auto-generated daily call list based on touch cadence |
| Remember personal details | Pre-call brief (last conversation, personal notes, project status) |
| Capture conversation outcomes | Voice-to-text post-call notes → auto-update CRM |
| Never let contacts go cold | Touch cadence automation with reminders |
| Prepare for meetings | Quick brief on contact history before lunch/call |

**How It Would Work:**
1. Michael inputs contacts (or imports from existing sources)
2. System schedules optimal touch cadence (every 2 weeks, monthly, etc.)
3. Each morning: Michael gets "Today's Outreach" list in Outlook
4. Before each call: Quick brief on contact history
5. After each call: Voice note → transcribed → logged
6. System tracks relationship "warmth" over time

**Pros:**
- Michael stays in control
- Builds on Outlook (his comfort zone)
- Removes mental overhead of tracking

**Cons:**
- Michael admits he's not naturally good at relationship building
- Still limited by his bandwidth
- May not be the best use of his strengths

**Best For:** If Chris is unavailable or if Michael wants to stay involved in BD

---

### Option B: Chris Does BD, Michael Handles Backend

**Premise:** Play to strengths. Chris is naturally good at relationships. Michael is good at systems and numbers. Swap their focus.

**Role Division:**

| Role | Chris | Michael |
|------|-------|---------|
| **External Relationships** | Primary | Support only |
| **Industry Events/Bars** | Attends, builds rapport | Stays home |
| **Follow-up Calls** | Makes the calls | Reviews outcomes |
| **Contact Data Entry** | Inputs via chatbot/voice | Maintains system |
| **Bid Follow-Up** | Relationship aspect | Tracking/analysis |
| **Pipeline Visibility** | Feeds info into system | Analyzes patterns |

**What Chris Needs:**
| Need | Solution |
|------|----------|
| Capture contacts quickly | Chatbot: "Just met John from ABC Development at the bar" |
| Schedule follow-ups | Chatbot: "Remind me to call John in 3 days" |
| Track relationships | Simple status: Hot / Warm / Cold |
| Hand off to Michael | Contacts auto-appear in shared pipeline |

**What Michael Needs:**
| Need | Solution |
|------|----------|
| See what Chris is doing | Dashboard of contacts, touches, pipeline |
| Prepare bids for Chris's leads | Notification when new opportunity identified |
| Track conversion | Which of Chris's relationships converted? |
| Provide backup | Access to contact history if Chris unavailable |

**How It Would Work:**
1. Chris meets people at industry events, bars, through network
2. Chris captures contacts via chatbot (voice or text)
3. System auto-schedules follow-ups, reminds Chris
4. Michael sees pipeline dashboard - knows what's coming
5. When opportunity is hot, Michael prepares bid materials
6. Chris maintains relationship, Michael tracks outcome

**Pros:**
- Plays to natural strengths
- Chris is already good at this
- Frees Michael for his core skills
- More scalable

**Cons:**
- Requires Chris's time commitment
- Need to define Chris's compensation/role
- Michael loses direct visibility into BD

**Best For:** If Chris can commit time to BD and wants that role

---

### Hybrid Approach: Split by Contact Type

| Contact Type | Owner | Rationale |
|--------------|-------|-----------|
| **New relationships** | Chris | His strength - social settings |
| **Existing relationships (David's network)** | David | He already knows them |
| **Bid follow-up calls** | Michael | Transactional, not relationship-heavy |
| **Technical discussions** | Michael | His engineering background |

This allows each person to do what they're best at.

---

### Technology Enablement (Either Option)

**Core Tool: BD Contact Chatbot**

Matt's idea from internal discussion:
> "Talk with a chatbot and be like, these are all the people I know, help me schedule"

**Features:**
1. **Contact Capture** - Voice or text: "Just met John Smith, VP of Land at ABC Development"
2. **Auto-Scheduling** - "Follow up in 3 days" → creates Outlook task
3. **Pre-Call Brief** - "What do I know about John?" → returns history
4. **Post-Call Logging** - Voice note → transcribed → stored
5. **Touch Cadence** - Auto-reminds when contact is going cold
6. **Pipeline View** - Dashboard of all contacts by warmth/stage

**Integration Points:**
- Syncs with Outlook Tasks (Michael's preference)
- Accessible via phone (for Chris in the field)
- Shared visibility (both see the pipeline)

---

### BD Approach Testing (Before Automation)

Before building tools, validate which BD approaches work:

| Approach | Test | Success Metric |
|----------|------|----------------|
| Industry watering holes | Chris attends 2-3 events/bars | Contacts captured, conversations had |
| Association events | Attend 1 construction industry event | Quality of leads generated |
| Supplier networks | Ask concrete suppliers for introductions | Warm leads received |
| Referral asks | Ask existing contacts for introductions | Introductions made |
| LinkedIn warm-up | Connect + engage before in-person | Response rate |

**Timeline:** Test 2-3 approaches over 2-4 weeks before investing in automation.

---

### Decision Framework

**Choose Option A (Enable Michael) if:**
- Chris is not available for BD commitment
- Michael wants to stay hands-on with relationships
- Short-term bandwidth is the only blocker

**Choose Option B (Chris Does BD) if:**
- Chris can commit dedicated time to BD
- Michael wants to focus on internal operations
- Playing to natural strengths is priority

**Choose Hybrid if:**
- Both can contribute part-time
- Different contact types need different approaches
- Flexibility is important

---

## Questions to Validate

Before implementing, confirm with Michael:
1. Would auto-created Outlook Tasks from bid emails help?
2. What 5-7 bid statuses actually matter?
3. Does QuickBooks have invoice reminder automation already?
4. What's the actual time spent on payroll entry currently?
