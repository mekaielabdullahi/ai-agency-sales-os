[First Name],

Last note from me - don't want to be a pest.

If automating [specific pain point] isn't a priority right now, no worries at all. But if it is, I'm here.

Either way, wishing you a great [week/month].

## Automation Rules

| Trigger | Action | Timing |
|---------|--------|--------|
| No response to outreach | Send Follow-Up #1 | TBD |
| No response to Follow-Up #1 | Send Follow-Up #2 | TBD |
| No response to Follow-Up #2 | Move to nurture list | Immediate |
| Response received | Stop sequence | Immediate |

## Notes

- Keep follow-ups shorter than original
- Change the angle slightly each time
- After 2 follow-ups, move to long-term nurture (content/value)
