Subject: Recap: Our Call + Next Steps

Hey [First Name],

Great chatting today! Here's a quick recap of what we covered:

**Your Situation:**
- [Pain point 1 - in their words]
- [Pain point 2 - in their words]
- [Current impact/cost they mentioned]

**What You're Looking For:**
- [Ideal outcome they described]
- [Success metric they care about]

**My Recommendation:**

Based on what you shared, I think an AI Audit would be the right first step. Here's what that includes:

1. **Business Mapping** - We map your 10 core functions and identify gaps
2. **Opportunity Matrix** - Prioritize quick wins vs. strategic improvements
3. **PRD + Roadmap** - Detailed implementation plan with investment breakdown

This gives you a clear picture of what's possible and exactly what it would take - whether you work with us or not.

**Investment:** [Price]

Want me to send over the details?
