## Template: Interested Response

**When to use:** Prospect shows clear interest, wants to learn more

```
Subject: RE: [Original Subject]

Hey [First Name],

Great to hear from you!

Let's find a time to chat. I have a few slots open this week:
- [Day 1] at [Time]
- [Day 2] at [Time]
- [Day 3] at [Time]

Pick whatever works best, or send me a couple times that fit your schedule.

Talk soon,
[Signature]

## Template: Questions/Hesitation Response

**When to use:** Prospect has questions or seems hesitant

```
Subject: RE: [Original Subject]

Hey [First Name],

Great question - [answer their specific question in 1-2 sentences].

The best way to see if this is a fit is a quick 15-min call. No pitch - just want to understand your situation and see if we can actually help.

Would [Day] at [Time] work for a quick chat?

## Template: Not Right Now Response

**When to use:** Prospect says timing isn't right

```
Subject: RE: [Original Subject]

Hey [First Name],

Totally understand - timing is everything.

Mind if I check back in [timeframe they mentioned, or 3 months]? Happy to share some useful content in the meantime if that's helpful.

Thanks for letting me know either way.

```
Subject: RE: [Original Subject]

Hey [First Name],

Appreciate the honesty! If anyone in your network comes to mind who's dealing with [pain point], I'd love an intro.

Happy to return the favor if I can ever help with anything.

Thanks,
