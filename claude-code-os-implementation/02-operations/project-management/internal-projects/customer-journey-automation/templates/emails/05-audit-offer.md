   - Identify gaps and risk areas

3. **Opportunity Matrix**
   - Prioritize automation opportunities
   - Quick wins vs. strategic improvements
   - ROI estimates based on YOUR numbers

4. **PRD + Roadmap + Money Slide**
   - Detailed implementation plan
   - Clear investment breakdown
   - Timeline and milestones

**The Outcome:**
You walk away with a complete picture of what AI can do for your business - whether you work with us or not. No fluff, just clarity.
