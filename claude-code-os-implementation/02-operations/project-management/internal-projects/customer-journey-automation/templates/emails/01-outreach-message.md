Hi Sarah,

I saw your post about struggling to keep up with lead follow-ups - that's a problem we solve daily for agencies like yours.

We build AI-powered automation that handles the repetitive stuff so your team can focus on closing. One client went from 2-hour response times to under 5 minutes.

Worth a 15-min call to see if we can help?
