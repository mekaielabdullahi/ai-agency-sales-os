   - [Option 3]

2. **Before We Meet**
   Think about:
   - Who else should be in the room? (ops lead, sales lead, etc.)
   - What systems do you currently use? (CRM, email, etc.)
   - What's the biggest fire you're trying to put out?

3. **What You'll Get**
   Within [X days] of our sessions, you'll receive:
   - Business Functions Map
   - Opportunity Matrix with ROI estimates
