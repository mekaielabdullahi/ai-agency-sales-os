## Draft Application Content

### Question: Why do you want to apply to the program?

#### The Big Picture Why

**We want to help small businesses survive the AI transition.**

There are businesses out there struggling because they don't know how to adopt AI. They're getting outcompeted. Their livelihoods are at stake - it's more than money, it's people providing for their families.

We believe Morningside's training and systems are the best way we can help a lot of small businesses scale their operations and stay ahead of the competition this year.

#### Why This Program Specifically

1. **Bleeding Edge Knowledge**
   - You're working on your most important initiatives
   - We want access to the latest systems and frameworks
   - This is how we build our agency and brand the best way

2. **The Shift to Consulting**
   - Development costs are sinking because we can build faster
   - The value is now in consulting: building trust, relationships, getting in the door
   - The audit process = speed to understanding what will actually help them
   - Jumping to solutions too quickly = going in the wrong direction

3. **Context Gathering is King**
   - In the age of AI, context is the most important thing
   - The sooner you gather context, the faster you understand what's actually going on
   - We've been able to do this quickly with our first clients

#### What We Bring to the Table

**Our Team (4 complementary skill sets):**
- Surprised more agencies aren't partnering up
- We formed our own pod because the official pod system was taking a while to go live
- We'd love to help you guys in any way we can

**Media Production Capability (Chris):**
- Audio recordings, video, photos from first meetings
- Clients are impressed - "these guys are professional, collecting all context upfront"
- Accelerates our progress significantly

**Commitment to Sharing:**
- We want to share knowledge we're learning every day
- Ramping up content systems to communicate on YouTube
- Open about sharing things that are working
- This is what drives progress forward

---

#### Our Philosophy

> "We are convinced that by giving and sharing knowledge - things we've learned, things that are working - that is what drives progress forward, that's what drives results."

We appreciate how much effort your team puts into communicating knowledge. The Hormozi-style system of reading and listening simultaneously - Liam has put hours and hours into making it easy for anyone to just pay attention and absorb.

**Our Commitment:**
- Make the most of every single call
- Contribute to the program
- Probably going to blow up the Slack with questions and information (we'll try to stay focused on what's most relevant)
- Help move the program forward and achieve the results you're looking for

---

### Structured Version (for the form)

**Short Answer:**

Development costs are dropping fast - the real value now is in consulting: building trust, understanding businesses deeply, and knowing where AI can actually help. Small businesses are struggling to adopt AI, and their livelihoods are at stake. We believe your training is the best way we can help them.

Our team of 4 has complementary skills, a media production capability for capturing full context from day one, and a commitment to sharing everything we learn. We want to be on the bleeding edge with you, contribute what we're discovering, and help as many businesses as we can.
