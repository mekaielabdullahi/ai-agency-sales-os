0:02 - Mekaiel Abdullahi
But then I forgot about it at a second when it caught me off surprise. Oh, yeah.

0:07 - Trent Christopher
It came up and said, hey, you're in a meeting. You want to record it? Yeah, hold on. Let me get the fireflies in here.

0:14 - Mekaiel Abdullahi
I got to rejoin you guys.

0:16 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
My mic isn't, my mute button isn't showing up. No worries. Okay.

0:33 - Mekaiel Abdullahi
Still not there.

0:37 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Thank you. I can't find you.

0:56 - Chris Andrade
This is my fireflies. There you are. Okay. Can you guys hear me? Yeah. Okay.

1:19 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Yeah, I'm gonna try to read you one more time. I don't know why my mute button doesn't show up.

1:28 - Chris Andrade
It's weird. just had a merge audio. What the hell?

1:36 - Mekaiel Abdullahi
Your audio is probably picked up by multiple things. Better? Yeah, we're good. Nice. Turn it off and on again, guys.

1:50 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Reboot.

1:53 - Mekaiel Abdullahi
I tried to do that today earlier, but it didn't work out. I was up there for like two and a half hours, three hours. lot with you. Oh yeah, you were telling me, like, I just have to do a system reboot and then I'll be back on. I jinxed it, bro.

2:07 - Chris Andrade
jinxed it. Was I on a ladder today?

2:10 - Mekaiel Abdullahi
Oh my goodness, bro. This is hilarious.

2:17 - Trent Christopher
Yeah, we'll have to just try the, we'll have to try the Fireflies thing one time, but we'll have to link it with the Slack workspace. And then once we do that, you can, it can automatically record stuff, so. Nice. But I don't know if it gets video. It might just be audio.

2:38 - Chris Andrade
Now that I got Fireflies connected to my quad, it's like, ooh, now I need to get the plate. So do you guys want to go over this opportunity here? We do. Yes, let's do this.

2:56 - Trent Christopher
Matthew, like, the minute that Matthew Matthew posted this in WhatsApp. I also had a notification circle about it. And I went to the circle first. And then I figured that that's what I said. Yeah. I was like, I have a feeling this is what's already in WhatsApp. And then I was reading it. And the whole time I was reading, I was like, yes, yes, yes. How do we get in here? We want in here. Um, so yeah, I was ready to fill out the form right away. But then I was like, wait a minute, pause. I almost did the same thing.

3:30 - Mekaiel Abdullahi
Honestly. Yeah.

3:32 - Trent Christopher
So yeah. So let's, uh, let's like look at the requirements or maybe let's just look at like what they're offering. Right. What this means to us. Did you read it yet, Chris?

3:43 - Chris Andrade
So I just saw the brief overview, but no. Okay. Let's go through it.

3:49 - Mekaiel Abdullahi
Let's go through it. So we spent 12 months running AI audits for enterprise level companies, every framework, every lesson, every template. We've now built in all one system. We're selecting 20 agencies to use it and help us design it for free, starting in January. Here's why this matters. AI audits are one of the most effective ways we're seeing agencies land clients right now, not just any clients, the kind that turn into 20, 50, 100k implementation deals. The audits build trust, uncover real opportunities, and position you as a strategic partner before you even send a proposal. But actually running audits, it's a grind. Research takes hours, interviews go sideways, deliverables get caught together, and at least the last minute. So we built something to fix it. Nice. we built, everything we've learned about running high stakes AI audits, which questions actually uncover opportunities, how to get interviews focused, how to turn qualitative mess into deliverables that makes clients say, when can we start? All of it built into one platform. Research, interviews, analysts, analysis, final deliveries, final deliverables. We'll systemize what you get if you're selected, free access to the full platform for the entire program, six to eight weeks, weekly check-ins with myself, Nick, as you deliver your audits, private Slack channel with direct access to us and the rest of the cohort, the exact methodology we use on six-figure engagements, this isn't, this isn't, here's the tool, good luck, we'll be in the trenches with you, troubleshooting, reviewing deliverables, making sure your client is blown away. You have an audit lined up for January, preference to those with audit scheduled or in very active conversations, you're committed to running it, showing up for calls, and giving us real feedback. You want to build audits into a repeatable part of your business. If that's you, apply here.

5:53 - Chris Andrade
Click.

5:55 - Trent Christopher
Click. Click it.

5:57 - Chris Andrade
Click it. No, seriously, click it actually, Jack.

6:00 - Trent Christopher
Because let's go into the form. I want to see what they are asking, like what they say in the form.

6:08 - Mekaiel Abdullahi
Oh, they said it wasn't working, but I had it pulled up on. What'd you think, Chris, on just that?

6:15 - Trent Christopher
Okay, I mean, that would give us everything we need to go in front of Graceland, To accelerate, to accelerate our capabilities to enterprise level audit.

6:30 - Chris Andrade
Well, like, so Guardian is the guy that I'm really here that's referencing, like Guardian, the big dog contracting company. Yeah. Specializes in asphalt, and grading, and paving, which is the hardest component to construction, and quantifying actual, like, out of all the industries, that's the hardest one to really understand. I know that if we came to him, we would have to be on our esh. And this would give us that support. Then, I mean, honestly, there's like some big construction guys that we can kind of lean in and Mike Kasira could get us in front of if we show them who we're talking about here. Right? Like, and I understand what, like, you thought we had, you know, which we still haven't even scratched the surface on the deliverable for Mike yet. But, you know what I mean? Yep.

7:47 - Mekaiel Abdullahi
I would say we pick a challenging, the most challenging. I would say that would be fun.

7:54 - Chris Andrade
Because we have more information that we would be able to sell ourselves for, as far as like, Bye. Bye. Bye. the project goes, that would be a big dog client, for sure. What did you say, Mekaiel?

8:12 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Is that I say we go for the biggest one?

8:15 - Mekaiel Abdullahi
choose, like, saying, like, hopefully we get accepted, something that we do. I say it's an opportunity, just the way I see it, to pick a challenging client or something that's out of our reach right now, that we know for sure, and it would give us the support to at least do a phase one.

8:36 - Chris Andrade
That's what the audit is, right?

8:38 - Mekaiel Abdullahi
And with the hopes of getting a clear picture for the implementation and breaking it up into a scope. Like, this is giving us an opportunity to do a six to eight-week AI audit. Like, kind of babysitter data audit, you know? And they're giving us a system slash platform, which means we have the support to do it. Like, it's going to be a step-by-step. All we're doing is being the middleman to the client. And I'm assuming this... This is for them to beta test whatever platform they're planning to roll out themselves. So it's a great opportunity, and I think we definitely need to take advantage of it. think also, before we even apply, I think we should all get in sync to, like, level up, like, for our probability to be selected to go up, like, all of us just, you know, apply and then just say we're all working together, or I don't know how we want to do that, you know? Yeah. I think that's what it's meant for, is catered to that. Have you, have you, have you been able to think- I honestly think we're going to be selected just off the fact that we're all in the AA. We all, we kind of just made our own- Like, our backstory alone.

9:42 - Chris Andrade
Yeah.

9:43 - Mekaiel Abdullahi
Like, I think, I think we have a good, like, a good chance to be selected. And we're kind of already geared towards that, you know? We've been following suit, so I don't, I don't see why not. Sure.

9:56 - Trent Christopher
I think I agree with that. think that there's probably, you know, I don't know. How many people were in the community, in the accelerator? So I was wondering about that.

10:06 - Chris Andrade
And the only real way to kind of keep track is how many newcomers you see in yours. I mean, so whoever's been here the longest, you can kind of get a good track of how many newcomers have been on since you started and averaged it, I guess, right? There's a member directory.

10:27 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Yeah, I'm looking at that right now.

10:30 - Chris Andrade
It's pulled up.

10:32 - Mekaiel Abdullahi
I'm trying to find something real quick.

10:35 - Chris Andrade
I think it's like a few thousand is my guess, but...

10:39 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Three thousand? I think so. I don't know why two to three thousand is the number in my head. I think I might have asked in the first call that I had, but...

10:50 - Trent Christopher
If you think about how much he charged us to get into this community, and if there's anybody that went beyond... ... ... ... And the initial fee, and then they're paying 300 some odd dollars a month, whatever it is, times, however many it is, think about how much money that is. Yeah.

11:18 - Mekaiel Abdullahi
Wow. Yeah. Yeah, there's so many.

11:24 - Chris Andrade
Okay. Okay. Okay. Can you guys see my screen? Yep. I see it.

11:28 - Trent Christopher
These guys. These guys right here. I have the right access to this owner.

11:34 - Chris Andrade
Right? That I can have the balls. Leo was supporting us. To approach these guys. And really tap into not only this guy, hold on. I really feel like I can get Gonzalez. On. On. On. On. On. Gonzales Oh, dude, we could get in front of Markham. I know we could.

12:20 - Trent Christopher
I would really, I would really, really like us to make sure that this is paid, whatever we do. Like, this is high level audit. This is, even if we don't have the skill built yet or fine tuned or it's not there yet, right? We have some maturity to grow into. We have the support of the community and they recommend doing $10,000 for an audit, right? $10,000 $15,000. I think that we should be trying to shoot for that, for these, for the same amount of audit and use some support. I think potentially. potentially.

13:00 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Do we shoot for more than that? Liam posted that video on how to run a $60,000 audit. I think we need to figure out how to even calculate what we should charge.

13:17 - Chris Andrade
Okay. Mark, Mark, Mark, Mark, Mark. Do we, do we have a coach that we could talk to?

13:28 - Trent Christopher
Or do we sign up for the program and then hope we get selected and then we ask them in the program? I say we talk to a coach, too.

13:38 - Mekaiel Abdullahi
I say we leverage everything. Everything we have, right?

13:42 - Trent Christopher
Yeah.

13:42 - Mekaiel Abdullahi
I said we all just talk to the coach and just say, hey, we've been working together for four to five weeks, been figuring it out. This is what we have. This is what we've done. We're interested in the opportunity.

13:56 - Chris Andrade
You know, we can do it together. We can do it all this. It doesn't matter.

14:00 - Mekaiel Abdullahi
But I feel like if we get our name out there, especially if we get them to, you know, recommend us or put in a good word for us, I feel like that'd be nice. Where's Darren? Is Darren not up here anymore? Yeah, I don't see Eric Bledsoe either.

14:20 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Yeah, what's up with that?

14:24 - Trent Christopher
Maybe holiday season, hopefully. Yeah, hope it's just because of the holiday season, but I would think they would just be their calendars, though.

14:34 - Mekaiel Abdullahi
Yeah, that would just be blocked out.

14:38 - Trent Christopher
Yep.

14:41 - Chris Andrade
Okay, so, listen, guys, I, I, again, I don't know how far to think here, right? And I don't even like this guy, we would, this would be some work. But dude, these guys are next level. And this is Brandon Heck. He can get us in front of Markham, okay? Now this guy, Gonzalez, . I'm pretty sure I can get Bert to get, I met the owner of this company. And I know the guy who got me, he can vouch. Now this one I can definitely get in front of. I can, I have this guy's number. Where I can call and say, Hey, this is what we're trying to do and work out some sort of arrangement here. Oh, you guys are staring at my bonsai. It's like, what the hell? So I honestly think with our origin story, how we got here, what SNS means to not only me, but nachos. Thank What our group is and what it can do for Graceland. Like, dude, we have so many, so many layers that we are trying to tackle right now, especially with our insight with construction and how we like, you know, we do have a lot of unique characters that maybe Liam has been interested in his whole, this whole time too. We never know. Like, I don't, like, have you seen any conversation in construction in the group at all? No, no, there's mention of the boring businesses, right? Say that again?

16:38 - Trent Christopher
I said there's mention of the boring businesses, which I don't know if construction falls into that, but generally speaking, when I think about what they're talking about is like skilled labor stuff, right? The painters, the construction crews, the contractors, that's what I think about. So they talk. And that's what hit me when he talked about that.

17:00 - Chris Andrade
And that's where those specialty systems come into play. And not only guys, like with Brandon's story and Mike Kasurik's story, and ultimately how I got to understand how much money can be wasted in just the administrative overhead cost alone that ultimately can be automated for companies. To eliminate that cost to bring back into the company, the overall for the growth strategy to be implemented better, right? All these things, you have crazy insights, dude. Like again, $700,000 worth of freaking documents to support a company's demise in the way they operate. You know? So I don't see why we couldn't have a compelling argument to be one of these guys. And we got construction for days, dude. Opportunities for days. We're just trying to figure out how to make it work. How do we even approach an audit to this kind of caliber? Because now we've got systems, hardware, and just the interviewing process alone would be daunting to ultimately understand. Right. Exactly.

18:32 - Trent Christopher
And we can't forget one of the first requirements is to have an audit lined up. Was it a requirement? Or was it like, these are the things we're kind of looking for?

18:42 - Mekaiel Abdullahi
Uh, yeah. Kind of like- It mentioned mentioned active communication or active talks, right?

18:51 - Trent Christopher
Yeah. So- there any- Is there Is there any- there any-

19:00 - Chris Andrade
Is there anything like that? What was that?

19:03 - Mekaiel Abdullahi
Is there a requirements list?

19:06 - Chris Andrade
No, this is the only thing that we know of right now, right there, what we're looking for.

19:12 - Trent Christopher
So what happens when you click on that apply here link?

19:15 - Chris Andrade
Yeah, click on that.

19:18 - Mekaiel Abdullahi
That link doesn't work, but I grabbed the link that Matthew shared in the group chat. That link doesn't work?

19:26 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
That's the one that I copied though, believe. Maybe I hit copy link address or whatever. But anyways, going through their questionnaire or their tally should help us figure out which one ideally we might be able to prioritize. I think we go through it right now and we try and figure that out. Yeah, it doesn't work for some reason. Well, had, didn't you pull it up, Mikaiel, before or no? No, I pulled it up from the group chat, you know, WhatsApp group chat.

19:59 - Mekaiel Abdullahi
to create Thank Yeah, don't click on it.

20:04 - Trent Christopher
Right click on it and go to the URL. There's something broken with the link. Message Liam right now.

20:13 - Chris Andrade
We got nine comments in. We'll be the first ones in there.

20:22 - Trent Christopher
Copy.

20:23 - Chris Andrade
I don't even know. But this worked. So the link worked. would be filled in already.

20:31 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Should I do it?

20:33 - Chris Andrade
No, company name. So what best describes you right now?

20:37 - Mekaiel Abdullahi
Already delivery pay for clients? I'm going to say that.

20:42 - Chris Andrade
Are you sure on your screen? Yeah. Right now we can see the circle. No, I need to hold the one. So. Show me. Show me. Be right back.

21:02 - Trent Christopher
So one of the questions is planning to, like it says, which best describes you right now? It says already delivering paid audits or run one to two pilot audits, but not consistent. I say that maybe. Planning to launch AI audits soon or help clients with AI, but don't currently run audits. So I feel like we're either B or C on that one.

21:26 - Mekaiel Abdullahi
Yeah, I'd say B, because we've essentially been doing parts of our audit kind of upfront. Yeah, I don't think we've been going the full, I don't know if I qualify as a full audit.

21:38 - Trent Christopher
Yeah. Not having conversations with multiple people, breaking down the processes and building out the ROI calculations. We're not doing any of that. So run one to two, but not consistently yet.

21:52 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
I think that makes sense. It doesn't even say paid pilot audits, it just says pilot audits. Yeah. So, and then it asks.

22:00 - Trent Christopher
If you have an audit lined up, definitely be, I mean, if it had, it doesn't even have an option for more than one. Well, we don't have any audits planned.

22:15 - Mekaiel Abdullahi
We have a phase one planned and we did parts of an audit, but not like a full ADC audit. So with that pilot, would that count as a pilot audit? Maybe because we're trying to, we're kind of stumbling through like how we're, how we want to do it, you know? Yeah, maybe.

22:31 - Trent Christopher
I mean, you could do B, you could just say, you know, maybe we did some pilot audits, but they weren't all the way from A to Z. So at least that's my perception on what we've done so far is that we're doing like lightweight assessments or strategy sessions or lightweight audits that, that really are just opportunity identification. Right.

22:51 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
And we're getting paid from plotter for, I guess we're being paid to deliver something, but it's also like we're collecting. data for the next step on it.

23:04 - Mekaiel Abdullahi
Definitely.

23:05 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
We're in active conversations with multiple. And by the time they get back to us, like, well, that, yeah, that's kind of what I felt like, actually, yes, an actor and active conversations with a client.

23:17 - Trent Christopher
Like, even though we don't have any booked, we have things lined up. Yes. So I kind of felt like, you know, maybe B and B for four and five. I agree.

23:30 - Mekaiel Abdullahi
And then we can explain our current prospects.

23:36 - Trent Christopher
How many audits have you completed so far? I mean, again, how do you answer that?

23:42 - Mekaiel Abdullahi
We can explain, like, we've been doing parts of an audit for our discovery and strategy upfront for free, but we haven't done an audit A to Z completely. We're currently doing phase one. And, and then just explained to them, like we we've been. Because honestly, I think if this didn't happen, we were eventually going to switch to doing the audit eventually, you know?

24:09 - Trent Christopher
Yeah, that's what we're gearing up to do. That's what we're tiptoeing into as much as we feel comfortable to push into right now, right? Yeah.

24:19 - Mekaiel Abdullahi
So what is your guys' definition of audit for this?

24:27 - Trent Christopher
Mine is what Liam has in his three-step framework for an audit. That's my definition of a full audit.

24:36 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
So with fully like ROI calculator, all the stuff, all the deliverables from that mapped out?

24:42 - Trent Christopher
Yes. That's my perception of an audit, like a fully executed audit. Yeah.

24:50 - Mekaiel Abdullahi
We've been doing parts and pieces, very lightweight, still, like building up to do that, but haven't really done that. Yeah. Did they allow letters in the form?

24:59 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
No? No. No. No. No. For that for number six. Yeah, can you type in letters?

25:08 - Trent Christopher
No, only numbers.

25:14 - Mekaiel Abdullahi
So we can, yeah, I mean, I'm assuming there's going to be an interview. Yeah, I assume so, too.

25:21 - Trent Christopher
I think we'll have an opportunity.

25:23 - Chris Andrade
So then what do we do? Do we all fill out the form?

25:26 - Trent Christopher
Yeah. And then in some area here, is there anything else you'd like to share, right? We just mentioned each other's names. Yeah. Yep.

25:36 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
So is this the application?

25:38 - Chris Andrade
Yes. Nice. 20 spots. say we do it right now just together.

25:44 - Mekaiel Abdullahi
Yeah. Let's just do it all.

25:46 - Trent Christopher
We'll just do it right now. So we'll just keep everything in sync, right?

25:50 - Chris Andrade
Yeah. All of us do it. So we're all filling it out at the same time? Yeah. But just don't click submit yet.

25:58 - Trent Christopher
Let's make sure we're all on the same page before you click.

26:04 - Chris Andrade
Where is the, did you guys put the link in here?

26:06 - Trent Christopher
It's in the WhatsApp, I think, but we can also send it in this if you want to. Yeah, if you don't mind.

26:12 - Chris Andrade
Yeah. I'm getting it right now.

26:17 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
By the way, there's exactly 1154 people in the member directory.

26:23 - Mekaiel Abdullahi
How'd you get that number?

26:24 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
I just copy and pasted everything and then put it in a Google Sheet. There you go. Nice.

26:33 - Chris Andrade
1154 or so.

26:36 - Trent Christopher
I mean, that's, that's just, that's quite a few. And that's just the people that are still in there, right? Yeah. People that have left. Right. And then are we all pointed towards the arise?

26:48 - Chris Andrade
We can.

26:48 - Trent Christopher
Yeah, I think the let's, uh, is the accompany name going to be all arise group? Yeah. Or Isaiah.

26:55 - Mekaiel Abdullahi
Yeah. I think I would give us, I just do the link in there.

26:59 - Chris Andrade
That's cool. That's Yeah. You're a fan, so fancy.

27:14 - Trent Christopher
What'd you pick? You picked B and B on this. Let's make sure that we're all staying synchronized on this.

27:31 - Chris Andrade
This is kind of exciting. Yeah.

27:37 - Trent Christopher
So I'm thinking we skip over the tell us more about the client for now.

27:48 - Chris Andrade
So, I'm sorry, I'm on number four. What did you guys choose from the fourth? Yep.

27:54 - Trent Christopher
You got your full name, your email, the company name. We just put a Rise Group AI for the URL. Right. Oh, you actually put the website in there?

28:11 - Chris Andrade
Yeah, he put the website in there.

28:13 - Trent Christopher
It's not a bad idea. No, I'm doing that.

28:21 - Chris Andrade
Hey, Daddy. Yes. What do you mean, though? You're me, Smalls? You're killing me, Smalls? Yes. Okay. Yes. Give me one second. Come on. Let's go. Let's go. I want take care of your robot. Oh, you're going to take care of my robot? Okay. Thank you. I'll take care of your robot. You sure? I heard Dad, he said, hey, Google, because I got her with a gym.

29:00 - Trent Christopher
So how many audits have you completed so far?

29:02 - Chris Andrade
What number do we put in there?

29:04 - Mekaiel Abdullahi
I'm asking Claude, I would say, I don't know, it can't be a big number, I don't know. One or two?

29:13 - Trent Christopher
Yeah, I would say one or two.

29:15 - Mekaiel Abdullahi
For audits completed so far?

29:20 - Trent Christopher
That depends on how we define audit, right?

29:22 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Yeah, I mean, I don't know, I was thinking about it just now, and like, so like, we either say one, I mean, okay, they might filter out everything besides everything, everyone who submits with zero. But also, they might be pissed off if we put one and we haven't actually done one all the way through. But also, like, Could be selling ourselves out if we don't.

29:48 - Mekaiel Abdullahi
Yeah.

29:50 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
It's like, how do you define audit? Like, we could have just been like, oh, like, you know, we got past the audit stage and we signed an audit.

29:56 - Trent Christopher
I have the definition of audit in my head because. I saw that video, but there's not really a clear, a clear you did X, Y, and Z to create an audit. So, yeah, and I think we don't want to get filtered out.

30:13 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
I don't think we want to put zero in there.

30:15 - Trent Christopher
We need to put one or two. There you go. Why do you even do five? Just put nines.

30:28 - Chris Andrade
I'm not even going to lie. It's ADHD, but I don't know.

30:34 - Trent Christopher
So, I mean, I feel like I would probably just put one, if I were, well, or two. What?

30:41 - Chris Andrade
I said we can explain ourselves, honestly.

30:44 - Mekaiel Abdullahi
Because I feel like any, if offered anything to you or kind of done the process map for, kind of goes into a bit of an audit, but not really. Like, you kill me, right? We've done paid discoveries, essentially. know, or non-paid discoveries. Like, that tie in. To the audit, I feel like the process map opportunity matrix, all time are parts of the audit, right? But we haven't done it A to Z because we haven't had the opportunity. We're focusing on cashflow. So I don't know. I feel like I don't, I definitely don't want to sell ourselves short, but I don't want to like cap, you know, I think twos in there is fine.

31:20 - Trent Christopher
And then we can explain ourself once we get past the initial, the initial filtering. Right. Yeah. So typical price point when we put there, we only got paid once.

31:30 - Chris Andrade
what?

31:32 - Trent Christopher
I mean, got paid for deliverable, but yeah, you can say we can just put 5,000 in there if you want. Yeah.

31:38 - Mekaiel Abdullahi
Technically in the SOW says a blueprint.

31:42 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
We're delivering a blueprint for transformation with us. True.

31:47 - Trent Christopher
So, yeah. So what? 5,000. So we only did one. Technically one if we got, but, but, but yeah, I mean, we'll shed, it's just one another one.

32:00 - Chris Andrade
That they're going to sign. We just got to finalize their deliverables, right? Yeah. And I... That should be a week, I think, is what we're planning.

32:15 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
I'm not sure, but...

32:16 - Chris Andrade
So you guys selected that we already had a paid AI audit for clients for four, and then I feel like number five... B and B.

32:31 - Trent Christopher
Oh, okay.

32:33 - Chris Andrade
But... Or do we do A?

32:35 - Trent Christopher
I mean, we already have... Kelsey's already paid us though, right?

32:39 - Chris Andrade
I mean, why... We already... We're already delivering an audit for our clients.

32:45 - Mekaiel Abdullahi
I feel like if our goal is to be accepted into the program, I feel like doing yes for five would make sense.

32:51 - Trent Christopher
Based on... Four, though. I'm saying... I was...

32:56 - Chris Andrade
Yeah, said A, because we're already... already... We're already doing an AI that's been paid for by Kelsey, right? But can we classify it as an audit?

33:09 - Mekaiel Abdullahi
Well, that's what we're doing right now.

33:11 - Chris Andrade
That's what we talked about earlier this morning about how we're going to interview the key stakeholders to develop the audit for how the daily operational flow is, right? And we're going to be doing the audit process.

33:28 - Mekaiel Abdullahi
Our first offer with Potter is essentially parts of an audit tied together with a little bit of deliverables. Exactly.

33:36 - Chris Andrade
Bingo.

33:38 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
I'm honest, with number four, it's like, we're already delivering paid audits, plural, like, I feel like... we know we have S&S too.

33:51 - Chris Andrade
They're another paid, they're another, like, literally the check is on the table. We just need to deliver our MVP to

34:08 - Mekaiel Abdullahi
I was going to say, could we, if we do get selected, right? Or I'm assuming by the time we have an interview, we should have a good idea of who, because I'm assuming it's going to be like, one, we're going to choose a client, right? And then they're going to have to run the full six to eight week audit. So should we have an idea? Maybe either like the two options that we do have on the table, not maybe Potter, because they already signed for something, but SNS, maybe do an audit, like an actual audit, and then go about it like that. If that makes sense, or do we go and try to find another client to do an audit for? Because I feel like the way it's supposed to work in like, for the agency is like doing the audit first, and then doing the implementation, vice versa. But right now, what we're, what we're, Essentially done for the first two is kind of do the audit or pieces of the audit and tie a deliverable to it to prioritize cash flow. So that like it makes sense, like, you know, we're headed towards the right way with the paid clients that we have now, we didn't frame it as like an audit, like because an audit's like you're not really getting the deliverable is the plan, essentially, you know, and the clarity. But we kind of tied in like we're planning to tie in with SNS a deliverable to to give them a quick relief. So. Do we read, we reassess our strategy with SNS or do we try to find another client to do an audit for using these guys? So we have easy events is scheduled Wednesday at 9am to another. Well, this would be a discovery call.

35:52 - Chris Andrade
But I mean, do we sell them on the do we like meantime, we can have those two.

36:00 - Mekaiel Abdullahi
We've our back pocket while we get set up for the interview, but meantime, any discovery call that we take starting tomorrow, I would say, do we prioritize, hey, the only way we do business is if you do an AI audit, if you allow us to do an AI audit, give you an AI blueprint, whatever, that'll essentially be your roadmap, and then we can talk about implementation. Is that what we should do?

36:20 - Trent Christopher
Yeah, I think that for me, the wording, the wording, this is the only way to do business.

36:27 - Mekaiel Abdullahi
Not like, not like, not like, I was just saying, like, I'm just saying the way, like, where, like, like, yeah, no, get you.

36:35 - Trent Christopher
Yeah, I was thinking like, not like client, not like client, I wouldn't say that to a client, I'd be like, yeah, no, I got you. I got you. Yeah. So I think that, you know, prioritizing that we do an audit is probably a good idea, right, to push the audit, so that we can get the appropriate deliverables. So there is the chance that a client is going to be like, I don't really want to do a full audit because I don't don't really want to transform. Can we just do something just to, just to try it out, just to see if you can make an improvement somewhere? Right. And I don't want to pay for an audit right now.

37:09 - Chris Andrade
So then what do you, that's why our success story with Kelsey is, yeah, he doesn't know he needs, he doesn't even know he's in an audit. We know he's in an audit, but he doesn't even know he's on an audit because we're, when we use the word audit, people freak out. So we are just ultimately, we got our foot in the door with minimum path of resistance. Yeah. Sorry. And now, um, we are doing our due diligence by doing our audit, mandatory audit methodology to, cause our next step, like me and Matthew were talking about earlier this morning is now we need to use this first iteration to give them his first But then also develop the questions or the structure to get a baseline on their daily operating cost. Right? A simple basic questions. And then have them, we use that as our reference to our ROI calculator, right? Yeah. like what we talked about earlier is that if we can reference their daily operating costs and use that as how we do our audits for moving forward, like we ask these clients, do you know what that question is? And if they say yes, then the audit or the conversation goes one way. And if they say no, then it goes another way because ultimately we know what kind of customer we're dealing with or client we're dealing with. They know their numbers or they don't. Right? And then And once we have a better understanding of what their daily operating cost is, and we use that to reference our ROI calculator, and then we can send them the calculator to see if they think that, well, yes, they said my monthly cost on subscription is 200, but now thinking maybe like 500. So let me put that, you know, let them mess around with the numbers ultimately to get what they think that ROI would really be like, after understanding it. And then we know, like Matt, I was saying, Matt is like, okay, we're saying that it's a $9,000, you know, return in six weeks or four weeks on your $10,000 investment. Now, that $9,000, let's just say it's like a of contingency or a factor of like, sorry, of like... You're kidding. So if we say that 9,000 is accurate, maybe to 70% or something, right? And so they see the calculator and they can see that. And then eventually, overall, in time, once they get more iterations, then they're going to see that baseline and how accurate it was, and then they're going to start to be able to hone in. On that calculator, right? And that's where we use that audit to get to that process of understanding what it is. And so we are doing an audit, in other words. Yeah, we are.

40:45 - Trent Christopher
Yep. So based on the word definition, yeah. Yep. So, yeah, I think that, you know, we're, I think we're all on the same page that there are going to be ways that we can assess the client to determine what type of client they are. it was, that's There's going to be clients that they aren't going to want to do a full audit, and we have to make the decision, do we want to give them an option to not do an audit and do something else? I feel like almost doing exactly what we just talked about, is that what we do with Kelsey, with Potter Mechanics, really is, even though we didn't offer him an audit, if we would have offered an audit and he would have said, eh, we could say, oh, okay, well, let's do a quick win, and then we'll also give you a blueprint, which is basically like an audit, in a way. Right, exactly.

41:33 - Chris Andrade
And that's why we're bringing this up for question four, is technically, so yes, we are getting paid to do...

41:41 - Mekaiel Abdullahi
I see what you're saying, and I agree to an extent, but I feel like if they're already at a point where they know AI is going to solve their issues, why would they not go through the proper framework to save them trouble on the back end, you know? That's the thing That's thing of it. That's the thing is they don't know.

42:02 - Trent Christopher
They're not certain that they want to spend the money on an audit. They would rather spend money on a deliverable, meaning something they benefit from other than a roadmap, a document. And the byproduct would be like to get there, you know?

42:17 - Chris Andrade
So there's two groups, right?

42:18 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
There's like the group of clients that we're going to work with that's like, okay, you know, we're not really sure. And then we don't, like we're a bit hesitant. And then we go in and we're like free audit. We'll look at everything and we'll present you guys something. Based on that, you know, we can do this. Here's our proposal. And then there's going to be people who are like, we know we need this. We're losing this much every year, but every month that we don't do this, we're ready to pay for an audit. Like we're ready to pay for your first step, whatever you guys do and, you know, pay you to get started working.

42:55 - Mekaiel Abdullahi
And how do we, how do we tell the difference with that?

42:59 - Chris Andrade
for

43:01 - Mekaiel Abdullahi
Yeah, I guess just prompting them, asking them questions, see if they're like, you know, we have to ask questions to make sense.

43:08 - Trent Christopher
Yeah, the qualifying questions, we need qualifying questions to figure out what type of a client they are, right?

43:15 - Chris Andrade
And that's where I think we use the question that I make up either A or B is by asking that same question, like, do you know your daily operating costs? Yeah. Because that will ultimately tell us right away that these guys have a handle on their finances or not. Yeah.

43:33 - Trent Christopher
So coming back to number four, are we A or B? I say we're A. Okay. I think we're in agreement that we're A because we did charge, even if we are just barely into it, we did charge for an audit. Right.

43:54 - Chris Andrade
And so for number five, my question to you guys is, For an actor's conversations, I could say, A, yes, it's scheduled. And this is where we can use our instance to leverage our application and say, we have access to civil construction industries. We just don't know how to present the ability to comprehend an audit with that kind of caliber, right? And so that's what's holding us back because we're working on our systems.

44:33 - Trent Christopher
So if we answer A or B, what you're talking about right now is basically what we need to put in the next box. Yeah. Yes.

44:45 - Chris Andrade
Tell us more about the client. It's like, well, we have multiple clients that are different sectors in the civil commercial construction industry. We are just developing. Our methodology to approach the table because we had one thing we could use our experience with concrete CEO like listen we were so confident we went to these guys already. We still haven't heard back from them. I don't want to keep bugging them at this point, you know, because I still have that relationship that I still have to keep on the other side. So we're, but now we're like, we just need to, we need to figure out how to have these conversations in the first place. I say it's open. I like that idea.

45:32 - Mekaiel Abdullahi
I say we just in this question, we keep everything up to five here and I think this is an opportunity to tell them upfront like hey, we technically have two paid projects that are pieces of audit with the deliverable tied into it, as well as access to to civil construction industry with multiple clients in the pipeline, but waiting. you. Thank you. Thank Thank But like kind of structuring out an approach, you can just explain that, and then, yeah, and then see, what do you think, Trent?

46:11 - Chris Andrade
Yeah, I'm trying to type it out actually right now so I can see what it looks like. Because that is, that's our approach. Like, so is there another section? Why do we want to be a part again? At the bottom, number eight.

46:24 - Trent Christopher
Number eight and number nine, right?

46:26 - Chris Andrade
I haven't seen what else we could reference, like, anything else you'd like to share.

46:31 - Mekaiel Abdullahi
I think we should answer eight and nine and then come back and fill in the number five or number six.

46:37 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Oh yeah, because we don't want it to be redundant.

46:39 - Trent Christopher
We want to make sure whatever we can put in those other fields, we want to put it up in.

46:45 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Yeah, and so for the why one, I think we do that first because that one's limited to two to three, and then anything else we can share a whole bunch of stuff if we want.

46:54 - Chris Andrade
And then, and then, like, for number nine, also, or number eight, is that we're all. We're finding that we're having maybe two or three different categories of clients. We have the ones that don't have any systems in place or not ultimately be built to build company on fragmented systems, right?

47:15 - Trent Christopher
Before you go too far. Number eight, why do you want to be part of this beta program needs to be only two to three sentences. An example is what would this mean to you and your agency? So number eight is more about what is it for us. Number nine is where we're going to put the stuff that you are actually describing, right? We have so many things that we need to sort out. So eight is more about like, what does it mean to our agency?

47:46 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Do you guys want to kind of like right now we can each answer this. can each go talk with Claude and answer each question. And then we kind of come back and compare notes and stuff. interesting.

48:04 - Mekaiel Abdullahi
So I got a confession, guys.

48:07 - Chris Andrade
I got a date at the gym, and I don't want to miss it. I won't be like, because I got my accountability partner, Chip, and then I'll come back, but it won't be still typically nine o'clock my time. Is that all right? I won't be awake for that. Yeah, if you guys are trying to submit it all at once, is that what we're trying to leverage here? We don't have to submit it all at once, but I think we need to be on the same page.

48:43 - Mekaiel Abdullahi
Yeah, I can paste out the answers, or the answers that we do.

48:52 - Chris Andrade
Yeah, if I said we're all about uniformity, and if that's what we want to do, that would be... Yeah. Also, we can... He's going to leave it up for a while.

49:02 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
He's not going to leave it up for one day and take it down. Like, there's people in the community that are successful that take days off. Like, he's going to leave it up for at least a few days, in my opinion. Oh, yeah.

49:12 - Trent Christopher
I mean, he's going to wait until they get to a certain number of people or a certain period of time. Yep.

49:21 - Chris Andrade
So you're saying we can come back in alignment tomorrow morning or something? If you want to, yeah.

49:27 - Trent Christopher
We can come back in a line tomorrow or three of us. I think it deserves it, to be honest.

49:34 - Chris Andrade
I don't see an urgency, a sense of urgency. Yeah, I think this really deserves a well-thought-out sentence because, yeah, a two to three sentence, that has to be an impactful statement. And there's multiple avenues with the... Like, I'm just thinking, like, if have we had a structured approach to a major construction organization, you know, it would... It would make a big difference to how I can approach money on the table. It's just, we're developing our systems right now, you know?

50:10 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Yeah, also have an opportunity, since we have four of us, we can each put a different answer for why do you want to be a part of this, so we can get more than two or three sentences for the whole group.

50:25 - Chris Andrade
I love that, dude, I love that, and then, because we have two specialty industries, right? The shed business, which we have the numbers to how much the growth rate's going to be there, and then we have special opportunities in the commercials, in the construction that we're trying to eliminate on the takeoffs, right, and because we know how much money we spent on takeoffs, and the administrative overhead process. We were trying to find out how to automate those systems for these kind of construction companies, that process to develop that kind of software infrastructure to like, you know what I mean, like, I know he has a whole other development program of startups on software, right, and or like, I know he has a whole other channel for that kind of stuff. So you're gonna see that, like, damn, these guys have a lot to offer in just one group, you know, if we all kind of make that alignment.

51:46 - Trent Christopher
Yeah, we're on the same page. So the question is, so tomorrow. Tomorrow, I have a little bit more limited availability, but I I I I We should still have the ability to be able to lock this in with you guys tomorrow, so if we can just try to come up with some, what we each want to put in these boxes, and then we'll just kind of collectively put it together and say, oh yeah, I like that, I like that, like that.

52:16 - Mekaiel Abdullahi
Cool. Yeah, I think that'll work out beautifully, for sure.

52:20 - Chris Andrade
This is a crazy opportunity, and I think, Mekaiel, you're the one who's in it. Like, come on, man, really? Like, the timing? Are you serious right now? This is just crazy, man. Man, I can't handle all these opportunities. Like, this is just nuts. That is an overwhelming of opportunities. I'm right where I'm supposed to be. That's good. Yep. stars are aligned. Yep. That's why I need to go to the gym, because I need to keep this heart rate under control, because it's like, ah, damn, it is nuts. You didn't grab that. I need to go get me a Coke lunch in my backyard, Mekaiel. Like, God. Dude, I just gotta...

52:59 - Mekaiel Abdullahi
Dude, gotta... Lifetime membership, and they have an ice tub, and I've been doing that the last couple of days, bro. What's the temperature? I think it's like 37, something like that. Bro, it's cold. It's cold.

53:15 - Chris Andrade
It's like 37? I don't know. Honestly, I don't know. I don't know. I don't know.

53:21 - Mekaiel Abdullahi
It's just freezing.

53:22 - Trent Christopher
I don't care to know, honestly. I just know I can put that.

53:27 - Mekaiel Abdullahi
How long? It feels great. The most I've been able to do is like three minutes. That's it's supposed to be.

53:34 - Chris Andrade
It's not 37 degrees.

53:37 - Trent Christopher
Unless you are already cold adapted, I promise you it's not 37. It's warmer than that. It has to be. It feels like 37.

53:45 - Mekaiel Abdullahi
Do I go in there?

53:47 - Trent Christopher
Would you cold plunge, I had a cold plunge in my backyard, and I had it over winter, and there was three inches of ice on the top of it. I broke the ice and I climbed in. I measured the temperature. was 33 or something like that. Two minutes is the longest I could do, and I had to wear booties on my feet because my feet would hurt. My fingers and my toes would just hurt.

54:17 - Mekaiel Abdullahi
That's the worst. I have to keep my hands up. I keep my hands on my head like this and I keep my feet up. I'll be like this in the pool. No, I know.

54:25 - Trent Christopher
But it was really, really cold. But for a cold plunge, you really only need about 50 degrees to get the better. So you really don't have to go that cold. But I didn't have a weight.

54:39 - Mekaiel Abdullahi
It all has to be 50, 40, and I could do it in the 40s and get away with it.

54:43 - Chris Andrade
Yeah. But it's cold.

54:46 - Trent Christopher
I mean, don't get me wrong. 40 degrees is effing cold. 50 degrees is still cold.

54:52 - Chris Andrade
So back in the day when I used to ride my motorcycle, that was my threshold. If it was below 40, I wouldn't ride. right. Let's Nope. You're talking about outside? Yeah, like riding my motorcycle. Water is completely different.

55:08 - Trent Christopher
Water is colder, a lot colder. no, I know. So that's what I mean.

55:13 - Chris Andrade
Like, I can't imagine water being cold, that cold. And that's why I'm so terrified. But my health benefits, like, I'll show you guys. I got some gnarly scars, bro. I got some, I'm a little accident prone. That's why I stay off mountain bikes and motorcycles. That's why I need a roll cage. Because I'm addicted to speed. But, yeah. I'm gonna have a cold plunge, man. I will. That's why we need to lock in these clients, so I can go buy one and put one in my backyard and have it hooked up to a battery or a plug. Keep that ready to go.

55:51 - Mekaiel Abdullahi
Tell my wife you can do whatever you want with the house when we get one, but all I want is a sauna and a cold flame in my office. That's it. Like, anything else, bro?

56:01 - Chris Andrade
I have access to any saunas that I don't have access to.

56:04 - Trent Christopher
I just saw one.

56:05 - Mekaiel Abdullahi
I just saw one at Costco and they're not bad.

56:13 - Chris Andrade
You guys wait till you- man I can't wait till we're leaving and I can show you all the cool that we're gonna like I'm gonna build. It's gonna be so fun.

56:24 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
That's why that's the why of this. Why do want to be part of the beta program so we can- because we want to see what Chris is going to build.

56:33 - Trent Christopher
Have you guys just ever heard of Earthship Homes?

56:36 - Chris Andrade
No. Oh dude, Earthship Homes? Google that and have fun with that dude because that's what I'm talking about. Like uh I'm talking like my plan is to build a not a commune but like I want to have as many people like-minded people come and have A spot where we can all just run and go to, I'm a little bit of a survivalist, I'm not going to lie, I'm a little bit of a survivalist, it's just like me, is how I think, and so I got some plans, because I got little kids, and then like, COVID scared the out of me, dude, I'm not going to lie, and like, it actually went down, I like, I didn't, like, I don't have a plan, wait, stores, I can't get toilet paper right now? Hold on.

57:31 - Trent Christopher
That 's for real, because I was thinking the same thing, I was like, I need some more self-sustainability, anything.

57:37 - Chris Andrade
dude, listen, and this is what I've been doing since 2013, right? And then, because I rent, I can't do what I need to do, because I rent, so I can't dig the 10-foot hole in my backyard that I need to do to build my greenhouse, to sustain my 130-degree His surface temperature in this summertime, right? So, yeah, but listen, first-year poems and like the whole theory behind it, This thing, it's this book to, it's like, I think it's like a hundred bucks or something for the book, but it's like The Ultimate Guide to Rebuilding Civilization.

58:20 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
And it teaches you all the skills of like, literally like building railroads.

58:26 - Mekaiel Abdullahi
Freaking, I'm looking at YouTube, right? Is it on YouTube? I think I've seen that page.

58:29 - Chris Andrade
Like starting, like starting from the beginning, right? This is the- As we do that in our lifetime, you never know. This is the philosophy of my life of why I'm here right now is for the polymath legit, is to have that idea. So if or when ever hits the fan, right, we all have a place to bring our people where we can, again. So So, yeah, so I, it's just, it's just a dream of mine, dude, to be able to provide that kind of, that kind of, that kind of living. And yeah, so yeah, but yeah. Oh, cool. I got, I got to go pump some iron, fellas. If you guys, are you guys going to be in? Because I can, I can put you guys in on my earpiece and be chiming in. I can be on.

59:34 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
But yeah, I'll be, I'm gonna go to the gym in an hour, so. Okay, cool. Awesome.

59:41 - Chris Andrade
I'll see you guys later. Hey, Matthew, you know what we got going on today? It's pretty fun. Good stuff. All right, let's see you guys. Bye. All right, see ya.

59:53 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Yeah, Chris got set up with the OS and he hooked up, he hooked up the Fireflies thing. So that was cool. How did he hook it up? Dude, I walked away from the keyboard like he had set up the cloud code OS and got it all built out and stuff. And then when I came back, he was like, he had already asked it, like, can you like hook up to Fireflies? And then it started building.

1:00:20 - Trent Christopher
Yeah, I think we broke. We took a break, actually.

1:00:23 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
And then when I came back, he was like, OK, it's at this point.

1:00:26 - Mekaiel Abdullahi
I just want to make sure I'm doing it right.

1:00:27 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
And then it was like asking for his API key. So all of these meetings go into his OS.

1:00:35 - Mekaiel Abdullahi
Well, he has the ability to pull them in.

1:00:39 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Yes, it's not automated. Yeah, we got that. And it's only the transcripts that you can pull right now. So I think there's a different API for summaries, but it's good enough to get started. That's so sick.

1:00:54 - Mekaiel Abdullahi
Save you so much time.

1:00:58 - Trent Christopher
Yeah, mean, that's that's the way to get started. And then ultimately we'll be able to build our pipeline and we can automate the process. So we keep just inching a little bit closer to integrated and making it to where it's just a totally repetitive task. That right there is the time to switch it over to automation. Get closer and closer to having single prompt if you can. And as you do these things, try to see if you can improve your ability to reduce how many times you go back and forth.

1:01:31 - Mekaiel Abdullahi
That's what I think. Ever since I got the max plan, I don't think about it as much, but like that's it forced me to do that when I didn't have the max plan. But yeah, always and try to be more detailed, too. And instead of just going back and forth, try to send one good message with all your things and then iterate.

1:01:49 - Trent Christopher
Yeah, 100%.

1:01:51 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
And like the review step, I think, is still going to be with us for a long time. Like we need to manually review strategically.

1:02:00 - Trent Christopher
And yeah, for everything like software, you know, all of our outputs, all of our outputs are gonna have to be reviewed in some way, shape, or form. We were talking about even some of the automations that we want to put in place that there really needs to be a human in the loop step. So when something comes in from an automation, we need to be able to review it before we accept it.

1:02:24 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Yep. Agreed. How would that look for like some workflows?

1:02:31 - Mekaiel Abdullahi
Well, might be.

1:02:33 - Trent Christopher
So as an example, let's say we talk about the what we're talking about just now, taking a meeting transcript, feeding it in and letting it output, let's just say the business function map. That's the only thing it does. It just takes in a transcript. And that transcript just so happens to have all the information it needs to do a business. That's a function mapping. Yeah. Well, on the output, you're gonna have a document somewhere, whether it be in GitHub or Google Doc. or a gamma, or whatever it is, it's a document. We need to be able to review that document before continuing forward, accepting it as it is, and continuing forward. And then there might need to be times that we have to go back and redo it because something didn't look right. Yeah.

1:03:21 - Mekaiel Abdullahi
Yeah.

1:03:22 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
I think it's going to be in the end, it's going to be like, we create the initial document, but we do a longer audit process and we collect more context over like a one to two week period. And we just keep feeding that context to it.

1:03:38 - Trent Christopher
Yeah. A living document in a way. Right. So, and then, um, another thing I just thought about too, is that when we, when we do start, once we, once we set it up, and we transcript in function mapping out. Okay. To help us validate that, um, That document that was output, we can ask it to create a different document as well that is more of like a bullet points and like a summary of the things that it discovered and like the key findings or like the key facts or something along the lines of it gives us a quick check sheet to say, okay, here's the things that were all factual that came out of the transcript and then look at the business function map and kind of just sort of do like a... Like a validation step almost. Yeah, like a validation step, exactly.

1:04:34 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Yeah, like a checklist and then we have it check its own work.

1:04:39 - Trent Christopher
You could do that too, but I was just thinking for the manual process for us, but then the next step is to ask an agent to review the work of the first agent. So yeah, that's the next thing.

1:04:51 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Yeah. I'm really excited about this, this AI audit.

1:04:57 - Mekaiel Abdullahi
feel like, I think the way we tell our... Story is going to be ideal. feel like question five, they're going to use to, I feel like question five is the most important question. feel like, um, and then how we, because, yeah, I feel like what they're, we have to think about what their objective is to launch the beta. I feel like they're just trying to collect user experience data, like, you know, work out their kinks, essentially. Yep, exactly. That's what they're trying to do is they're trying to work out their kinks.

1:05:30 - Trent Christopher
They're, they're giving it as a benefit to the Excel, the people that are accelerator, because it's their ideal people to be able to test and try this. Right. And then maybe they'll release it further to outsiders, um, and sell it. Right. But, but we're the ideal people to try.

1:05:49 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Yep. So what are, what are they looking at for the ideal client? Like they want to know how soon they're saying what they're looking to achieve. So they're. We want specifics on what they're looking to achieve and how soon. So it's kind of like we've, it should be one that maybe that we've already started. That's what I was almost thinking.

1:06:11 - Mekaiel Abdullahi
Like that's what hit me first, but then talking to you guys, just trying to get aligned. I don't know. Like for me, it doesn't make sense to try to go find one, find a client that needs an audit. feel like that'd be a reach into January. Maybe not. Maybe we come across someone this week that wants one. But I feel like we should reframe almost with the, not even almost, but just use the clients that we're working with to say, Hey, like these are the projects we're working on. Yeah. Like we, the more detail it says, the more details, the better.

1:06:44 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
If we don't know the most, the client that we know the most details about is plotter mechanics. Like we can say, Hey, they want an inventory management system, but like early 2026 and like within Like, yeah.

1:06:58 - Mekaiel Abdullahi
within violation the, or

1:07:00 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Like March or February or something. Right. And then they might be like, Oh, like they know exactly what the client wants. Like they have all these details already about this client. Uh, this is a great candidate for our program.

1:07:12 - Mekaiel Abdullahi
And then I feel like the, also the benefit for us would be real world experience on how to run like a high value audit, you know, that'd be the benefit to us. So if we're literally just trying to learn how to do, get pretty much getting our hands out through proper audit. Um, then why not use something that we're already working on? You know, cause it's like, it's a benefit for us to get the experience. It's going to be a benefit for the client. Cause it's going to add value. Our goal is to just get in and get the knowledge. Right. So why not use either Potter or SNS? That's where my mind went initially.

1:07:46 - Trent Christopher
Yeah.

1:07:47 - Mekaiel Abdullahi
And talking to you guys, I was just, okay, maybe we could reframe it, but the goal is to eventually do this ourselves and to get the skills to do this ourselves. Right. So why not? Yeah. Let them help us. And teach. Like, essentially teach us how to do it properly, you know? What's up, Chris? That's what I'm thinking, honestly. And then it's already there. We're already working with this client. It's already signed. Boom. And then we can align with Kelsey's goals. Just like you said, Matthew, like right now, we can be like, the goal is to get to this. And we already established that, yes, this is a part one for Kelsey. And as long as we didn't even offer him that crazy of deliverables. I feel like we can still hit the deliverables while taking them through this audit process. We just need to figure out if we're going to charge them for that or not. Like, you know, like after this phase one. Yeah. That could be an option too.

1:08:41 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
I want to consider too, do we have more information about SNS?

1:08:48 - Mekaiel Abdullahi
Yeah, that could be a possibility too. What kind of information are you needing?

1:08:53 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
So we were looking at the questions five.

1:08:58 - Mekaiel Abdullahi
says, do you have an audit lined up for January? Yeah. data? what,

1:09:00 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
We're saying yes, it's scheduled. If yes, tell us more about the client, company size, industry, what they're looking to achieve, and how soon. The more details, the better, I think is the key sentence. The more details, the better. So we're trying to think of who do we have the most details about that we're lining up an audit for January 2026. Plotter mechanics, we have a lot of details about. S&S, we have a lot of details about. And S&S also leads into Graceland. So it has that. Readiness development leads into construction.

1:09:40 - Chris Andrade
Yeah.

1:09:41 - Trent Christopher
So I think Chris was proposing earlier that we can go bigger. But at the same time, we don't know anything about those businesses yet. So it wouldn't fit into the scheduled category. It wouldn't fit into the, what do you know about the. It's not true though.

1:09:57 - Chris Andrade
It's not necessarily true. We don't.

1:09:59 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Chris.

1:10:00 - Chris Andrade
Right, because that's the angle that I'm trying to kind of put on the table is, but we all have to uniformly say it as a group is like we have this client Remus Development, and what's unique to the Arise group is also one of the founders of Remus Development also is a founder or a partner in Remus, I'm sorry, in Arise group is a partner in Remus Development. So he has invested interest in the success, and that's where we have access to a lot of crazy kind of like unique data sets that are trying to understand and make sense, right, because it doesn't make sense on how commercial construction is ran in bids and how they expect companies to spend thousands Thank Thank you.

1:11:04 - Mekaiel Abdullahi
I think it's important just for like the case of this opportunity in front of us with the AI audit, I think for us, it's important to identify who we could use right now in order to take advantage of the opportunity to learn how to do a proper AI audit. That's the goal on our side, right? And then we just talked about, the goal for the AAA is to kind of beta test this system or this software or this tool that they're planning to leave the general. We're their ideal clients because we're already building agencies doing this. And so that's their goal. So in order to align with them and improve our chances of being selected, I feel like our best options is either to work out a situation with Kelsey or SNS. But also, since SNS does tie into Grayson, which is a bigger opportunity, why not use the AI? So to kind of get SNS like really thought out and planned and phased out the proper way with the intention of going to Graceland.

1:12:13 - Chris Andrade
Can I propose something here? This is why I hop back on real quick, is I'm realizing what we're under cover, what we're exposing here. And if we come at it at the angle of the ultimate reason why we need your help is because we are trying to change a lot of people's lives. Because there's a lot of, like me personally, with my connection with SNS and how they're suffering and how I know we can help them. But the whole shed industry itself, right? And the customer service factor is losing sales. Remus development in the construction and what I did. To get me there, to understand how the construction industry works, but then when you guys and yourself, like, we came because we're trying to help our own situation, and even with the community, Matt, you've discovered other talents in the community, right, that you want to help, right, and, like, we just need the opportunities to kind of bring them in on. And we just need to understand how to do it right in a construction or in an industry that we really don't understand. We know we can do it, we just need to know how to approach it.

1:13:45 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
The change on its angle, for sure. And explaining the details about that, for sure. And I think another thing that's going to help us stand out, Chris, is something we talked about. You know what we were talking about with how, so in the world, in the age of AI, like capturing the context, right, is essential.

1:14:12 - Mekaiel Abdullahi
I forgot about that.

1:14:14 - Chris Andrade
You go, you run, you run, you go.

1:14:17 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
So yeah, so you guys know how, the way that we got going so fast is because Chris got audio recordings, went and sat with the businesses, got audio recordings. And was able to move us through the audit phase much more quickly than, okay, we need to get a meeting, we need to have a call, we need to do this, can I get your time? Like he just, he's just like, I just want to help, we're your friend, like he's, he's reaching out to friends that he knows that he's known. Warm outreach. It's like, we come in with the media, the, the, the speaker, the audio recording, and that just captures stuff as you have a conversation. And then the long term vision is like a full blown sort of media company that's capturing all the context we can with video, audio, and that's the jerky solution.

1:15:15 - Chris Andrade
Like we're not just attacking it from that angle, like our approach methodology behind the support of just the brand and like just using our artistic values too, you know?

1:15:31 - Trent Christopher
Yeah, I think that is exactly something that needs to be told. That story that you just said needs to be told in our form, not a later interview, it needs to be told in our submission somehow.

1:15:46 - Chris Andrade
And if you go back to the day, October 24th, when we first met, right? October 24th, that Monday morning at 9am, right? We met because that's how I got into Plotter Mechanics. And that's how I got into, like, ultimately other companies, right? And then that's what the topic that we ultimately kind of uniformly came in agreeance on so fast was that fact of personal connection, not only just understanding that a meeting like we're doing now is what daily life is, but when you add that personal connection to it, it really seals the deal on, so to speak, like, yeah, well, it might, if that customer is in Germany, it might be worth just go fly out there or to add that touch or whatever. I'm just saying, it's just, if that touch goes a long way. Yeah, I think we have a lot of unique angles here.

1:16:53 - Trent Christopher
We may not be the, we may not be the more We agency that is somewhat implied in their questioning that we could be, but we have a lot of unique things about where we currently are, what we've done, and where we want to go. So I think that those things need to be said somehow. Yeah. Yeah.

1:17:21 - Mekaiel Abdullahi
In the application, we tell the story.

1:17:24 - Trent Christopher
Somehow we have to tell that story of where we've gotten so far and where we want to go as well. So, and that's, there's boxes for that, but we need to put it in there. I think that's just as important as what client we choose. For sure. Yeah. If not more. If not more. Yeah. If not more. I mean, we were putting a lot of focus on question five, which I think is probably, to be honest, I think that might be what they believed in the beginning as their, one of their most important criteria. But then, yeah, our story, I feel like, or how we got here is important.

1:17:59 - Mekaiel Abdullahi
more. play

1:18:02 - Trent Christopher
But eight and nine, I think eight and nine at the bottom there are going to be where we're going to separate ourselves from the others. I don't think five is going to separate us. I think five is just going to be a baseline check to make sure that they have done something, like they have a client, they've done something, that kind of thing. But eight and nine is where we're going to stand out.

1:18:30 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
And adequate level of detail also with number five.

1:18:34 - Trent Christopher
Yes, exactly.

1:18:37 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
And then they're going to get probably a bunch of submissions and then it'll be like a bunch of similar ones. And then we stand out with the last couple.

1:18:48 - Mekaiel Abdullahi
And I don't know if it's a couple of people working together like we are. I don't think so.

1:18:54 - Chris Andrade
And with me being able to be like how I've been posting about my day. Like, you're gonna see that. I even thankfully, I'm in my second one, not, I think his team, because ultimately, I got me to meet you guys. And I was like, dude, you guys, I think that's that moment. I was like, I got freedom, like, When I met with, I met with Lou, he's my coach, the accountability coach.

1:19:21 - Trent Christopher
And I told him what we were doing. And I was asking questions about like us working together. And I don't remember what the question specifically was. But he's like, Wow, that's, that's interesting. He's like, I hadn't heard anybody doing that here in the, in the community, like us trying to like all come together to build an agency together is what he said, he hadn't heard anything about it yet.

1:19:41 - Mekaiel Abdullahi
I'm saying 2026 goal is to be on the podcast, but we're gonna be, we're gonna be up there.

1:19:48 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Oh, my gosh.

1:19:49 - Chris Andrade
And I told my, so the very first time I met my, my, my girl, the, my rep, my agent, my, my, my introduction was like, gosh. Thank My goal is to be the most successful candidate in your group.

1:20:05 - Trent Christopher
And then she referenced that.

1:20:07 - Chris Andrade
And she's like, well, how do you plan on doing it? And I told her, she's like, that's actually a really good plan. So again, like that, I've been shooting big since day one. And because I think that's how I mean, at the end of the day, that's how confident in the plan I am. And it's just look at what what's kind of gotten us like. But that's why I'm so grateful for you guys, dude. And I just like, man, and then it's just like Mekaiel said, like, dude, it's like, really? Not really. like, this is happening right now. This is crazy. Are you guys going to be hanging on here? I don't have a lot longer.

1:20:50 - Trent Christopher
Okay.

1:20:51 - Chris Andrade
I'm going to disconnect now and go to the gym and not have to worry about my phone in the gym. But that's what I was just wanting to jump back on. I think we need to bring in the element of, we're trying to bring our people on to this, we're trying to bring that community aspect of how we got here and help the ones that got us to this far, you know, and that's the kind of the angle of our approach, in my at least, is like, that's ultimately how I've gotten to where I am. So, yeah, talk to you guys tomorrow, or I'll be up later tonight messing around with this fucker watching this video. Thanks, Matthew. Yeah, I really want to get this thing locked in. So I'll be nervous now tonight. I'll talk to you guys later. Bye.

1:21:43 - Trent Christopher
Hit it hard.

1:21:44 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Yeah, I'm gonna be, I think I want to try and finish the training pretty soon. I have like seven hours left in the training. I want to finish that so I can have my meeting with my success coach. I think if I can do that. What training are you talking about?

1:21:59 - Trent Christopher
You're talking about the Excel?

1:22:00 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
The solution, sorcery, even if I do it on 2x and just knock it out and come back to it later.

1:22:06 - Trent Christopher
That's what I was doing is I was just slamming it out. I was playing at like 1.25 or 1.5 and I was just like, just in the zone. And then I go get a snack and I come back and just keep watching. I was so pissed.

1:22:18 - Mekaiel Abdullahi
like, I need AI transcripts. I want to sit through this video. Well, you don't have to for most of them because they give you the document and they just read the document.

1:22:30 - Trent Christopher
Yeah.

1:22:33 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
When I was thinking I was going to lose access, I went through all the documents real quick. I got all the links. I actually posted it in the AI agency channel. put it on the Google Docs. And it's all the links from Solution Sourcery. Awesome. Yeah, yeah.

1:22:49 - Trent Christopher
I don't know.

1:22:50 - Mekaiel Abdullahi
Oh, I think you did about a while ago. Dude, I've been posting so much stuff in Slack.

1:22:54 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
I'm not, I'm not surprised if people haven't read stuff. But, uh... uh...

1:23:00 - Trent Christopher
I mean, I just look at the top of Slack, just all the, like, the unreads and the threads, and I just look at those and I go through them. I'm like, okay, yeah, this? Yeah, no. I'll read it. I like Slack for that.

1:23:12 - Mekaiel Abdullahi
Like, I prioritize Slack and your guys' messages, but all the other, like, thanks, bro. I'll be like, no, bro. Maybe if, like, someone needs me at work, it's dire. But, like, I can't. I can't. I have to, like, stay away from my phone sometimes, too, because it's, like, it's too much, like, you know? Yeah, it can be.

1:23:29 - Trent Christopher
It's very distracting. For sure. Yeah.

1:23:31 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
For sure. So, okay.
ACTION ITEM: Draft Q8/Q9 for AAA beta; share in WhatsApp for alignment - WATCH: https://fathom.video/share/GrGSFj4oKssRhrNnPZmrFnB_D45JNMUc?timestamp=5012.9999

1:23:34 - Trent Christopher
So what do we want to do? How much longer do we want to be on here? What do we want to finish while we're on here? This is kind of, I updated some context.

1:23:43 - Mekaiel Abdullahi
This is kind of, like, my base. I'm going to start here, and then I'm going to iterate on number eight and nine, just more personally. And then we can leave five until we come back and meet tomorrow. But I'm going to expand on our story more, what Chris talked about. We about eight and nine, but I'm going to give it, I'm going to come from the objective of like two signed clients, SNS Wilfins and Plotter, and then go with the personal story.

1:24:15 - Trent Christopher
Yeah. And then are we trying to put this stuff in our own words or are we copying it? Yeah.

1:24:19 - Mekaiel Abdullahi
No, put it in our, I said, we put it in our, like, we, we have like a base, right? And then like we eight and nine are very flexible as long as we're saying the same thing. Essentially, but in our own view POV, I feel like it'd be, and then it's all going to tie back together to the same company. Anyway. So it's fine. Like, you know, yeah, but yeah, we should definitely like just review before we got it. Yeah, for sure.

1:24:44 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Review, we got to on the same page for like the multiple choice, I think for sure. Like have the same answers there probably. And, uh, yeah, the other stuff in our own words for the most part, probably. Maybe the client one, we were more aligned. Cause it's like, we're picking one client. We definitely don't want to have like one of us, we'll a different client. So yeah, I think that's important to remember as well.

1:25:10 - Mekaiel Abdullahi
We just have to align. I think we will too. Like we have options. That's the good thing. We do have options. Yeah.

1:25:18 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
We'll think about it.

1:25:21 - Mekaiel Abdullahi
Also, also Trent going forward. Um, I think just strategy wise, I think it is good to like, yeah, always have that in your back pocket, like a quick one. Um, but what do you, do you think it would be a problem to explain it? Like, Hey, we, we do like an audit process or not even like we do like a road mapping process, give you a blueprint. And then we go into implementation, see how they feel about that. And right now you are building, just give them an opportunity. Hey, since that doesn't align with what you need right now, we're offering people quick one solution where we, you know, give you a lightweight version of that and just see if we give you a quick one. Yeah. Sure.

1:25:59 - Trent Christopher
Okay. think exactly that. We don't lead with the quick win. Yeah, we're not leading with the quick win anymore.

1:26:05 - Mekaiel Abdullahi
We have to get more in line with what we want to do eventually, which is good. With those first few wins, we needed to do that. We've moved on from that very quickly, sooner than I thought, honestly, but why not, you know?

1:26:17 - Trent Christopher
I believe that we need to start working towards what we want eventually, a little closer to that, and then just have something in our back pocket, right? So I don't think, I don't, some people are like, no, you're selling a product. You're selling exactly this. If they don't want it, then move on to the next person. But then that's not really how I like to work. I'm like, well, there's a way to work with a client and help them in other ways, because not everybody's in the same place. Not everybody has the same mindset. So some people are ready to go one path and they're not ready for the other path, right? I think it's just smart in life to be flexible, not just black and white, you know? Be dynamic and adaptable, right? So. So we don't necessarily negotiate, Hermozzi talks about this and other places talk about this, you don't negotiate on your price, right, but you can negotiate on what the deliverable is, what your offer is, so you can trim things off, and then you can give them a different price, and that's what we're doing is that we basically have our primary mission, which is to go down the audit path, so that we can give them the proper assistance, or if they don't, they're not ready for that, then we have our lighter weight situation, where we can give them a quick win, that also includes a, a, a, a blueprint, right, yeah, 100%, yeah, yeah, I think that we should approach it that way, so, and then also, like, price point, that's got to be included, because that's, that also really ties into, like, the whole, we're here to help people, like, yeah, like, negotiate. Yeah.

1:28:00 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Deliverable, but we're still going to give them something just for meeting with us, you know, business process map or whatever. Yeah.

1:28:08 - Trent Christopher
So I think that, you know, by trying to position the audit as our first step, it positions us as a long-term partner, trying to really make change across their whole organization, not just one little measly little product. Yeah. Yeah.

1:28:26 - Mekaiel Abdullahi
A hundred percent. If they need like to build that relationship, quick win, boom, for now, I eventually, I doubt, like once we have a few case studies under our belt, I doubt it, we're going to be able to choose. And then, um, for price point, I guess that entails more, like, it's a six to eight week thing. Did we up our price?

1:28:49 - Trent Christopher
Um, what, what, what do we just roughly just whatever? What do we think that a week worth of time or of our, of our. Uh, if, if an audit takes four weeks, what do we, how much do we think that would be something that it would be valuable by? I think that almost, it kind of scales by the business, but let's just throw out numbers, um, per week, like, yeah, sure.

1:29:18 - Mekaiel Abdullahi
If you want to do like four weeks or you just want to do per week, I guess I was basing it. I was framing it off the six to eight week mark, because that's what they suggest. What just based off that, right? I would say just for now where we're at, I would say realistically, okay, but I think, I think 10k is the good.

1:29:38 - Trent Christopher
That's fair.

1:29:39 - Mekaiel Abdullahi
I think eight weeks of work, six to eight weeks of work, 10k for six weeks.

1:29:46 - Trent Christopher
Well, so 10k. Let me think about this for a second. Um, I think it depends, right? At least at least that's the the base that we don't own it. Minimum. Minimum 10kern. I almost actually think that maybe 15 might be a better target. I agree.

1:30:07 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Are we talking about filling out the form and what we're saying we're charging or are we talking about a specific client? Just strategy, overall strategy.

1:30:16 - Trent Christopher
Okay, like overall strategy, what we are trying to offer our clients. Okay.

1:30:25 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Yeah, I kind of think it's there's different levels like I want to watch more of Liam's videos and like because we can get like initial answers like maybe they fill out onboarding form and we get revenue number, we get number of employees number and then based on it. Yeah. Yeah.

1:30:46 - Trent Christopher
But yeah, so we would need some preliminary numbers to be able to answer.

1:30:54 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
If it's a big company like we're like, we shouldn't just be like, oh, 10. We should be like, we know more, like we can't just give you a price without knowing more.

1:31:06 - Mekaiel Abdullahi
Honestly, it almost ties into the five question framework of like how much it is. But we need to know more about their company, not just the five questions.

1:31:16 - Trent Christopher
Not just the overall revenue. Well, yeah, we need to know like the size of their company, maybe how many different departments they have. How many, you know, how many employees they have? How many different locations do they have? Like these kinds of things to measure the size of the potential audit, right? Yeah.

1:31:42 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Because like how many interviews are we going to have to have with key stakeholders, right?

1:31:46 - Trent Christopher
Yeah. Yeah. So we want to get an idea and there's an average you can come up with, right? To figure out if it's a hundred employee business, how many stakeholders there are or how many like supervisor. So... I had Okay. You can figure that out. It breaks down at 30 anyway. Typically, I've heard many studies say that one person with 30 underneath them is like the max you can go. Yeah. So there's a way to estimate the supervisor and managers. But anyway, my point in saying that is that we need preliminary questions answered before we can actually give them an estimate. And I think it should scale based on that somehow. Makes sense.

1:32:34 - Mekaiel Abdullahi
I bet they already have that figured out, too. I bet they do, too.

1:32:38 - Trent Christopher
And we would get more insight onto that probably if go into the program, if we get into it. We're getting into this program.

1:32:46 - Mekaiel Abdullahi
It's not it's not. I'm pretty confident. Yeah.

1:32:51 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Like. Like you said, there's more there might be more accomplished people, but our story is pretty unique.

1:33:01 - Mekaiel Abdullahi
I think we're attached to what Liam was trying to do, honestly. Yeah.

1:33:07 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
I'm going to switch to my phone because I've to head to the gym, guys. But I'll stay on the call for as long as you guys want. Okay.

1:33:15 - Trent Christopher
It's on there.

1:33:16 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Yeah, I need to iterate on my answers here.

1:33:20 - Trent Christopher
Yeah, I need some time to add more detail, too.

1:33:24 - Mekaiel Abdullahi
Yeah.

1:33:25 - Trent Christopher
Yeah. I want to make sure that we get the human element in there that Chris mentioned. I want to make sure that we get, you know, Matthew's story about how we sort of, like, stumbled upon the importance of context and the importance of where we're headed down, really, to be honest. We're headed down a path of doing full collection of all conversations and all context so that we can give a proper result or good outcome. So. Should we. almost take all four of our stories and kind of blend it in some way, shape or form. Yeah. But we, we don't have to have a copy paste. Like we can have one portion of it in mine and one portion of it. And yeah.

1:34:12 - Mekaiel Abdullahi
I'm thinking like when we come together tomorrow, all of our stories together are like something, you know what I'm saying? Like, you know?

1:34:19 - Trent Christopher
Yeah. Yeah. So. Yep.

1:34:23 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Maybe we even iterate over a few days and like not tomorrow's not the final. I don't know. I don't want to take, too long though. but we do a couple iterations. Yeah.

1:34:37 - Trent Christopher
Yeah. I don't want to, I'm fine with meeting again tomorrow and then trying to finalize it and be done with it on Wednesday. Okay. I we, we, I think we need to be before the new year hits, but that's our mission. Our goal is to have this submitted and we need to feel good about it before the new year. right

1:35:03 - Mekaiel Abdullahi
That's the way to kick off the new year.

1:35:06 - Trent Christopher
100%.

1:35:07 - Mekaiel Abdullahi
That'd be so, imagine, imagine we're getting the program January 1st. Holy. No, if I get that email, bro.

1:35:17 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
We want to, we want to, we want to work with, we want to work with you guys and we want to, if can put you guys on the program and we want to get on a call with you. We want to have Liam, or maybe Liam's messaging us. You know, just like, I want you guys to meet the team. We're so excited. That'd be sick.

1:35:38 - Trent Christopher
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. That's, I mean, this is, this is the right place to be if we want to accelerate this. And hopefully this propels us into the, the AI agency atmosphere. So. Yeah. You know, again, you know, Chris, Chris is a big. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I was to say, he's like, he's very excitable, right? He's like, he's like super into this and he shows it a lot, but I'm in the same place if I don't express it as much as he does or the same way he does. But I haven't, it's been a long time since I've wanted something to work out so bad, to be honest.

1:36:22 - Mekaiel Abdullahi
I honestly can't believe like, I don't know for the first, like, it just drives so much purpose, like interest. I don't know. Like, I don't know what it is, honestly, but I think I'm grateful that I have it. I've just never been so focused and never wanted to do something as much. So yeah, 100%. And then like I was telling Matthew all the time, you don't understand how it just, you know, Trent, coming from the trading community, like, you know, how hard it is to find people that really want to, like, share this enthusiasm and like the same same drive as you would like to get to where you want to be. And it's hard, bro.

1:36:52 - Trent Christopher
Like, it's hard to come across those kind of people.

1:36:54 - Mekaiel Abdullahi
And when you do, when you do find good people, you associate yourself with them. And then Imagine if we weren't doing the work we've been doing the last three, four weeks, and like, I feel like we would have been in a different place. I feel like me personally, individually, I don't think I would be here. I'd probably be stumbling along some other way, like five, 10 steps behind.

1:37:17 - Trent Christopher
I feel like I've been positioning myself and been working my way into this for the last four years, probably, probably last four years because I was really dabbling in just wanting to do my own thing and really wanted to take the leap into entrepreneurship. And I just wasn't doing it. And then eventually, I was like, you know what, screw this, I'm done with the corporate world. And then, you know, that was a year ago. And I've been loving it. I've been loving the whole the whole thing. But even though it comes with the challenges and the uncertainty. But I feel like all of my steps up into this point have really, like, have set me.

1:38:09 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Yeah, I couldn't agree more with my journey to this point also. I mean, I've been through a lot with the whole e-commerce thing. I kind of jumped from my full-time job into just straight up doing e-commerce only, and I thought it was all going to work. then I put everything into it, and a lot of challenges, a lot of realizing where I messed up, and just learning. And this year, a lot of in the trenches on just building automation, building one automation mostly, honestly, and then being so focused on that one problem, and then coming into the AAA community, and then just seeing how it's like... There's actually... The business has so many problems, like, every business has so many problems, we need to figure out what's the best problem to work on before we start building, which is the exact opposite approach to what I was doing the whole year, struggling, but I was learning cloud code, I was learning all these things the whole time, even though I was failing, but, you know, it's like... Yeah.

1:39:23 - Trent Christopher
If I didn't have the contract work that I'm currently doing right now, I don't know what I'd be doing, to be honest. I mean, I've been doing this work, and it's been giving me enough income to be able to stay afloat, but every other thing that I've been doing has really been learning, building, stacking skills, positioning myself so that I can move beyond where I am. But I still was a little bit lost. Like, I was still a little bit, like, wandering, trying to find that, like, groove, or trying to find where my place was.

1:40:00 - Mekaiel Abdullahi
The business has so many problems, like, every business has so many problems, we need to figure out what's the best problem to work on before we start building, which is the exact opposite approach to what I was doing the whole year, struggling, but I was learning cloud code, I was learning all these things the whole time, even though I was failing, but, you know, it's like... Yeah.

1:40:23 - Trent Christopher
If I didn't have the contract work that I'm currently doing right now, I don't know what I'd be doing, to be honest. I mean, I've been doing this work, and it's been giving me enough income to be able to stay afloat, but every other thing that I've been doing has really been learning, building, stacking skills, positioning myself so that I can move beyond where I am. But I still was a little bit lost. Like, I was still a little bit, like, wandering, trying to find that, like, groove, or trying to find where my place was.

1:41:00 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
And to be honest, this is the first time I've felt since I've been on my own that this is the place to be. So, yeah, it's, it's, yeah, I don't, I don't believe in coincidences. You know, I believe we're here for a reason and nothing happens by accident. So it's just right on time. Like we're like, we're here. Like, you know what I mean? It feels good.

1:41:23 - Trent Christopher
It feels, it feels really good.

1:41:24 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Yeah. Um, another thing I was thinking about was that, um, I can't even remember who said this. Um, but, uh, there's no such thing as luck or luck is the combination of preparation and opportunity.

1:41:41 - Mekaiel Abdullahi
So, so luck isn't really a thing. It's really just the fact that you've been doing a bunch of stuff to prepare for something. And then that opportunity comes along and they collide.

1:41:51 - Trent Christopher
Right. So, um, that's where I think. Yeah, a hundred percent, hundred percent. Like there's actually. And then there's the other side of it that's like, there's actually opportunities there all the time. But it's until you get to a point where you've been doing the work in the right direction, then you end up from the work itself, like you end up aligning with people who are kind of on the same path.

1:42:22 - Mekaiel Abdullahi
And I think that's kind of, that's what happened for us. And then like, we just, we all like, came together, we all had such a similar mindset, because we must have been doing something similar, the whole, like, attraction, like, literally, we attracted each other, because we were doing what we're doing individually. And then we just crossed paths, and we decided to work. Success is when preparation meets opportunity, right?

1:42:44 - Trent Christopher
And like, yeah, literally, like, exactly what we've been doing. So it's, I mean, I mean, I'm all in on it. So I'm excited to, we'll get into this program. And it's going to propel us to the next step. Okay. Thank

1:43:00 - Mekaiel Abdullahi
think that, you know, we're going to have, there's going to be a lot of work to do, I think, in the first couple months of 2026. I don't know if there's going to be a lot of revenue that's going to come out of it, but I think it's going to ramp up.

1:43:16 - Trent Christopher
And it will set us up, it'll give us the ability to be able to do five, six. Me and Matthew were literally talking about how we, if we sign more clients, we're going to run into an issue of, like, organization and running it through.

1:43:28 - Mekaiel Abdullahi
So this will give us the ability to handle multiple projects at the same time, too, because we'll have the structure behind it.

1:43:34 - Trent Christopher
And we'll all know, like, boom, boom, this, that, this, that, this, that, that stuff. And we'll use our internal tools to track those projects along. Yep. And I believe, I believe in, you know, leveraging other people's knowledge. So that's why I'm in this community. And if Liam is, is throwing a lifeline out there to, to help boost us and accelerate us even further than he already has, I'm going to take. I'm Liam is like an accelerator, you know the Mario games, like the little accelerator, Literally just booo booo booo booo.

1:44:09 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
If we get this, we basically have star power at that point. Literally. That's the goal, that's what we're going for. I'm excited for it to come to fruition, and it is. I just don't know if it's gonna happen like a, it's not gonna be a switch, right? so it's going to happen over some period of time it's be boring, it's going to happen we won't even notice exactly, you'll look back it's like one of those things that people it's like I've heard it said multiple times people wildly under or they overestimate what they can do in a short period of time but they underestimate what they can do in a year so just keep working hard, keep pushing forward and when you look back 12 months from now

1:45:00 - Trent Christopher
You'll be like, holy cow, I've come a long way. So yeah, like these meetings and like these recordings and stuff like that can be so dope. I know. so glad we started recording on video. I think it's really important, not just for content, but for the memories also like going further, going off of what you said about a year out. Like I've heard also about 10 years is like, you can't, you can't really even imagine what you can do with 10 years. Like it's, it's beyond what you can imagine. Like you can, you can kind of paint a picture, but you really can't fathom it. Like you can't really even understand it. Right. So unless you're that person that does nothing, then you'll know where you're going to be in 10 years. You'd be nowhere. You'll be the same place you are now. Literally. And that's, that's a lot of people. You'd be surprised. That's most. I learned, I learned a lot. A long time ago. I learned a long time ago. I want to say it was, oh, maybe, gosh, I can't even think. See, 2019. So it was probably 2019-ish. 2018-ish or something like that was the time when I changed my mind, my mindset. So I was 240 pounds. I was mostly fat. I was not the gym person. I ended up switching mindsets and said, I'm sick of looking at myself in the mirror. I don't like it. I don't like how I feel. I feel terrible. I wanted to change something. So I started going to the gym. And I was like, you know what? I'm shifting my mindset from the point of saying, I no longer say I'm not a gym goer.

1:46:49 - Mekaiel Abdullahi
I'm no longer a gym guy. I am now going to where I am a gym goer. I am a gym guy. And then I signed up for a one year membership at the gym. The gym at the YMCA, I just went and paid for a whole year because I said, if I do it monthly, I'll have an excuse to be able to just stop going. So I said, if I do it for a year, then I'm good. But anyway, at that moment, I started to realize how average most people were when I started thinking about like, okay, I'm pushing forward.

1:47:22 - Trent Christopher
And then other people were like, whoa, what are you doing all that for? And good transformation.

1:47:27 - Mekaiel Abdullahi
And I started to realize my friends, like, I'm still really good friends with my good friends, but a lot of them I've left behind. And I haven't really aligned with many people with the same mindset. So coming back to what you were saying, Mikael was that, you know, most people aren't on the same path that we are.

1:47:47 - Trent Christopher
Yeah. And that's what makes us different. That's what makes us special. I value your guys' time and friendship and partnership because, yeah, I mean, we've all seen it. Like we've all been in situations, you know, and it's hard.

1:48:00 - Mekaiel Abdullahi
It's really hard. And yeah, like, I like how you said that because you have to assume the identity of who you want to become and align yourself with that identity. And same thing with bad habits too. If you want to like get rid of bad habits, you don't like align yourself with that identity. So like smoking or whatever, it'd be like, I'm not a smoker.

1:48:17 - Trent Christopher
I don't smoke. So that's not something to think about, you know, you have to, you, you go away from it. If other people smoke, you have to just keep out of it. Right. You have to stay out of that environment. So my dad always told me when I was a kid, he's like, tell me who your friends are. I'll tell you who you are. And that literally, like, I didn't even understand it till I was in my like twenties. Cause it was really trying to tell me like the people you surround yourself on are going to impact your life more than you can imagine. And, um, so true. So they say that I've heard it many times. Like I said, is that, you know, you're the average of the five people you spend the most time with. Right. I mentioned my friends and they're just like, nah, man, they underestimated because they don't.

1:49:00 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
I understand like the mindset, the energy, like the words that are coming out of people's mouth, like everything that you receive and it goes into you, affect your thoughts, and your thoughts shape your reality. And I've learned I got to protect my mindset, I got to protect my peace. They're not like, cool, like, you know, And I want to be in the room where I am either the least intelligent, least successful, but I don't want to be in the room where everybody is the bottom. I don't, I don't want to be, I don't want to be in the group or the room where everybody's at the bottom 1% or 10% of population. I want to be in those upper rooms, but I want to be the stupid one. I want to be the one that, that is being uplifted by the success and the intelligence and the experience of those other people. So that's why I try to put myself in those positions. And that's why I'm in this community really is Yeah, we're taking this transfer. I think my like, yeah, I used to, so I used to go to like, I used to have a group of friends, so I was kind of close with, but, so in college, there was really cool people, I spent a lot of time with them, they would party a lot, and they would drink a lot, and I would drink with them, but like, I wasn't the one who's like, hey, let's go get alcohol, I was like, if we don't have alcohol, like, it's fine, like, whatever, you know, it's not gonna affect me, but, like, I went to UCSB, it's a, kind of like, known as the party school, and, so there was always parties there, and then like, when I, after college, like, my roommates, like to, one of them liked to throw parties a lot, he moved out a couple years ago, and, but like, the last couple years, last year, or two, maybe, like,

1:51:00 - Trent Christopher
Like, I've been, my time, I've just been, like, saying no to certain friends a whole lot more, and, yeah, and I kind of think that, like, I just, and I'm just used to it now, like, I just don't spend, the expectation used to be that I would go to everything. I would say yes to going to whatever event there is, I'm going to go, I'm going to be there, because we're never going to get the chance to hang out again, but my mindset has now shifted.

1:51:30 - Mekaiel Abdullahi
to, I can always hang out again later. Like, I actually need to make sure that I'm good, that I set up my future family to be good, and I need to do this work right now, actually. I'll never get the chance to do this again. No, and you, so I wish I would have worked harder in my younger years. I wish I had the opportunity to work a little harder in my younger years.

1:51:55 - Trent Christopher
I actually was working hard, but I made a mistake. And I had. I a kid when I was 20, so that made things more difficult, but I wish if I had the opportunity when I was younger to have the same mindset I have now and to be able to push forward and build something early so that it's easier into the future. So when I have a family and set me up, but now I feel like I'm behind the ball. I think we always feel behind. I think no matter what, I feel like even playing the what if game is like opening the door for the devil, because I feel like everything that happened was supposed to happen, you know, and it's get you up for today and who you are. Yeah. 100%. It's a blessing, you know.

1:52:47 - Mekaiel Abdullahi
At the end of the day, I feel like there's always what's to come is better than what's gone.

1:52:51 - Trent Christopher
That's what I really feel, you know. Yeah, it definitely can be, for sure. And it depends on your mindset. And that's the thing. You have the mindset of what's to come. It's better than what it was. So, but I wanted to say that, you know, talking about how we're always going to want more. Okay. The entrepreneurs typically always have a mindset that what you have is never enough. You're always chasing the next thing. You're always chasing something better or to improve that kind of thing. But do you guys know who Chris Williamson is? Yeah. On YouTube, he is probably one of my one or two top YouTubers and podcasters. He's like, he's in the top 10 list of podcasters. Chris Williamson. So he, he interviews a lot of really high level people. And the way that he interviews is awesome. Like his mindset is and the way he's He asks questions, just the conversations he has are freaking awesome. My favorite conversations with him are actually him and Hormozy. They've been together multiple times, but him and Hormozy going back and forth, talking life stuff. But anyway, I was listening to a video, I was on my way up to this, where I'm at now, I'm on site.

1:54:24 - Mekaiel Abdullahi
So I was driving for an hour and I was just listening to this podcast. And there was a guy on that podcast and he said that for the last 15 years, 15 years, he has been journaling in some app that he has on his phone. So he's been journaling and it gives him the ability to look back at all the things that he has worried about, desired, thought about, the things he did, the things he wanted.

1:54:54 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
And he he said that he's done that, he reviews it. And he, what he's learned. So is it's all the same stuff, like all the time, even though he moves forward, even though things kind of change a little bit, the things that he desires are always like the same thing.

1:55:13 - Mekaiel Abdullahi
It's always something next.

1:55:14 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
The concerns and worries that he always has, even though he's in a different place in life, they're all the same. So I think the goal then, right, the lesson for me, I feel like what I take out of that is to always just be content. And while still staying hungry, you know? Yes. Contentment, because contentment is hard to find, like that contentment of saying enough is enough or whatever. I feel like humankind, right, is like we're weak to that. We always want that. Like it's natural. It's normal. But also just pairing it with contentment. So two big things that I've learned in the last year, I think, are... So one thing is, like, I've always kind of, like, beat myself... I've up for things ever since I was little. Like I remember there was this group of friends that I had growing up. We were like brothers when we were in elementary school. And like, I just remember like this one kid who was like, I'm super similar to him, but he was like, yeah, like we got to be critical of ourselves because that's how we improve and get better.

1:56:22 - Mekaiel Abdullahi
And I always resonated with that. And then, but I kind of have taken it really far, I think at certain points in my life.

1:56:29 - Trent Christopher
And like, somebody told me, like, you got to give yourself grace. Yes. And it took a while for me to kind of start actually doing that. But, but now, so grace, and then the other thing is gratitude. And now I practice gratitude every single day. Gratitude. Yes. Yeah. And it's gratitude, gratitude and just being grateful is probably I would say the most powerful thing, one of the most powerful things in my life. Gratitude. Gratitude. And it's kind of similar to contentment because it's like just appreciating what I'm thinking about what I'm grateful for just really, I think, opens the door to more blessings and kind of what I'm thinking about.

1:57:14 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
That's actually a verse in the Quran.

1:57:17 - Trent Christopher
And if you show gratitude, we'll definitely favor you because like 100% and that just goes into whatever you like put up, like you'll get back and being grateful is one of those doors that, you know, that are open to you.

1:57:29 - Mekaiel Abdullahi
It lets you receive more blessings. 100% Thank you for that, Matthew, reminding me that I need to go back to my gratitude journal.

1:57:36 - Trent Christopher
So I had a journal and there was always a question that asked about what you're thankful for for the day. Right. So I need to go back to that because that was it was powerful, even though it kind of felt a little bit like, oh, well, like a task, a chore sometimes. But at the same time, it's it is powerful to have that. And like you said, it is very similar to contentment. You can be hungry and desire. You can't count, And think of it like a muscle. It's, it's something that you build. It's something that you can be grateful for the smallest things. And you can always find something to be grateful for. Always, always find something. Yeah. If nothing else, it's like I woke up today. So. Yeah. You can't count, you can't count the players that got placed on you. Like you can't, like, it's impossible. You can think about anything. Like how many breaths do you take a day? How many times does your heart beat? You don't even try. you know, like. Yeah. Coming back to what you said about like being hard on yourself or overly critical. I've always been my most critical person in my life. Like I've always been the hardest on myself that anybody else ever has. So, um, I, I feel that for sure. Um, and then giving yourself grace.

1:58:55 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
I don't think that I really knew how to give myself grace. time. long I'm I'm

1:59:00 - Trent Christopher
And until I actually started my fitness journey. And actually for years, I actually was doing the fitness thing, but I wasn't giving myself grace. It wasn't until I got to a point where I felt like I was like, okay, I feel really good where I'm at. I like, I'm in a rhythm, right? I kind of figured out who I was.

1:59:24 - Mekaiel Abdullahi
At that point, I'm like, okay, it's, it's not what you do sometimes. It's what you do most of the time that makes progress, right? So if, if one day you fall off of the, the, your track, right? It's not that big of a deal. You just get, it's what you do after that.

1:59:46 - Trent Christopher
It's getting back on and continuing what you were doing before. So giving yourself some grace is what that is. I remember you telling me that a few weeks ago when I was saying like, Oh, I didn't wake up today or something. but it. sense of glad You it's okay. That's giving yourself grace. It's the same. It's okay, but you aren't going to do it tomorrow or you're not going to do it in two days from now. You know, sometimes it happens two days in a row, but at the end of the day, you're still a gym goer in my head.

2:00:14 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
That's what I'm saying. You're still a gym guy. You still go to the gym with a regular basis, the regular pace. So you're still somebody that cares about your health. So, yeah, you know, it's crazy. Like we're all so similar. It's very, like, and I've noticed that a lot recently in my life. Like, even like sometimes like some of the roles I've learned, like all the people around just so happen to be aligned and it's so crazy. I'm super grateful. Super. It's crazy. So what's our, what's our goal for tomorrow? What do we, I want to like, see if I can close out in less than 10 minutes here and work my way into bed. Um, so we want to have, we want to realize. In line with our tally form here, right? Answering these questions. Is there something else that we should be trying to make sure to push forward on? Like, maybe a hot thing that's on our mind right now? Yeah, for me, so I think, like, obviously, we all go off, we brainstorm, we try and answer these questions on our own.

2:01:18 - Trent Christopher
Probably, I'm going to probably incorporate the Fathom transcript as well. But then the other thing is plotter mechanics, there's there's a question that I've at the end of the plotter mechanics thread right now that I want us to think about, which is related to the personal versus business separation.

2:01:42 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
And then also, Chris is going to be doing calls with people with the key stakeholders at plotter this week. So I think we should be spending our time making sure that we make sure that And he has access to the right questions that are going to move the project forward.

2:02:06 - Trent Christopher
So from the development side, what questions do we need answered to be able to build the right thing? Yeah. So what's the primary purpose of the interviews? Is it going to be to just get a whole view of the business processes or is it, yes? Okay. I didn't know if was targeting what we're doing now or the inventory system or if it's more holistic.

2:02:34 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
I think it should be holistic and then we touch on the inventory system and we need to get key questions answered for what we're doing right now.

2:02:44 - Trent Christopher
Because the thing is, what we're doing right now seems really important right now, but it can ship based off of whatever happens, like whatever new information comes in. Oh yeah.

2:02:58 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Yeah. So the more information we get. Yep. We just have to be careful about scope. We have to be careful about scope. Like the new information can come in, but we also have to make sure that we make progress in the same direction so that we can, you know, finalize the deliverable. can actually like deliver the product.

2:03:18 - Trent Christopher
If we continuously take feedback and continue to redirect, we'll never get there. Right. So at some point we have to like lock in whatever the feedback was. Yeah. And the new information should go into the next phase rather than the current phase. Yes. So we have to look at relevance, right? Relevance to what we're trying to apply now. And also where have we already come to? I think right now you've done some testing in Quo and Jobber, but I don't think anything's final at all. So if they provide us feedback really soon, we can adapt. Yeah. And the number one thing I was thinking is that question that I

2:04:00 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
We could hook up Quo and Jobber right now. The only issue is, he could get requests in Jobber for every call that comes in, but the only issue is, it's his personal line. So are we going to have calls with his wife and his son? Yeah, so he has to either, and I have replied actually, so there's two things that he probably, maybe more than two.

2:04:25 - Trent Christopher
But the first one is either, he transfers both phone numbers, his business and his personal into Quo, okay? But then he has to tell everybody that's personal to stop calling that number. Or, he needs to take and tell people that are calling his personal number for the business purpose, to start calling the business number. He needs to tell someone to stop calling a number. Like, to call a different number. He has to tell people, call this number, somehow. Yeah. I think that's probably what's going to need to happen.

2:05:07 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
The other option is we forward calls from the current number to our own system, and then we filter out what's personal. But that's just overkill. I think that's too much. That's not going to be us spending time on the important problem.

2:05:26 - Trent Christopher
Let me know. Yes, I totally agree with what you just said. We need to focus on what the important problem is right now. And it's not trying to determine what is personal and what is business. It's more about how can we offload work for the business into automations or process.

2:05:45 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Another thing is, too, is that if we just literally go right now, and we just were to turn the switch and plug in Quo into Jobber, they're going to have this wild influx of requests that comes in. And they don't use it at all right now. So they need to be prepared for when we turn that switch on. Yeah. So we train them how to handle it, what the SOP is going to be.

2:06:16 - Trent Christopher
And then I wonder if it's, it's probably not like past, it's just like from right now, you get requests for each incoming call. I believe so, yeah. I believe it's going to be as soon as you turn the switch on from that point forward. You're going to be getting requests in the request box. Yep. Yeah.

2:06:36 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
So at that point, they're going to have to have a different process than what they've been doing because they haven't been using requests really at all. Right. So we need to put that together, plan it out. I think trying it out was like a really good idea.

2:06:52 - Trent Christopher
I almost think we should all do it, but at least everyone should see the videos that are recorded of the process of like. But it's really easy. Yeah. you. Yeah, simple. It's just, like, Woke gets set up, Jobber gets set up, they get linked. You can just watch the videos, you don't need to set up an account. I don't know if, like, maybe you, Trent, because you're going to be doing development. Yeah, I'll see if I can set it up and do it, and then these other guys, if they really want to, they can just watch the videos so they get an idea of what's happening. So I'll see if I can set that up. So I have to figure out what my priority is. I don't have a whole lot of time, right? So I just have to, like, do I do that now, or do I reserve time for it in the very near future, is what I'm trying to figure out.

2:07:36 - Mekaiel Abdullahi
Like, I can do that. Go ahead. That's more, that's more like boots on the ground stuff. I think we want you for, like, the high-level feedback. Like, me and Mikaela should be tackling stuff until you get back. Okay. So if you guys want to start working on, you know, the preparation for anything that you can do.

2:07:56 - Trent Christopher
I know that we're all limited time, we're all busy and all that stuff. But, like...

2:08:00 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Trying to work towards the delivery for Plotter and unblocking, like you said, unblocking the Quo switch is probably going to be the hottest thing.
ACTION ITEM: Draft Plotter interview Qs + Quo→Jobber SOP; share w/ Chris for on-site - WATCH: https://fathom.video/share/GrGSFj4oKssRhrNnPZmrFnB_D45JNMUc?timestamp=7691.9999
ACTION ITEM: Draft Plotter interview Qs + Quo→Jobber SOP; share w/ Chris for on-site - WATCH: https://fathom.video/share/GrGSFj4oKssRhrNnPZmrFnB_D45JNMUc?timestamp=7691.9999 Okay, we'll lock in on that. There are the two things. Sorry, I'll take two things. First one is preparing for switching over to Quo integration.

2:08:22 - Trent Christopher
And then the second one is preparing Chris for his visit. But just giving him the proper questions and things we need to hit on. I'm planning to set some time aside from tomorrow to just like, I'll probably sit down with Matthew too, just to think through what that entails and how we want to approach that. I don't know if a PRD is necessary right now, but just like pre-qualifying questions on how we're going to attack that. And then as well as the second thing.

2:08:54 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Yep. Yep. Yeah. So. Yeah. The. The. The PRD, we should put together a draft.

2:09:04 - Mekaiel Abdullahi
I mean, I think you already put together a draft.

2:09:05 - Matthew Kerns (12kernsmatthew@gmail.com)
Yeah, I tagged it up.

2:09:06 - Trent Christopher
I don't know why I was showing 404 earlier, but I just shot it in the plotter chat. No, you're good. Yeah, I think I should drop soon, too, you guys. Yeah, no worries. It's time for me to, yeah. I want to jump off here, like, soon, so... Is there anything else? I don't think there's anything else for me, so I think we all have a good idea. This is a good call in many ways, right? It'll be worth it. It'll be worth it. It's... Yeah, and it's going to be some of the most rewarding work I think I've probably ever done. Like, to be able to help small businesses and help the people. to scale their companies like I'm so grateful for the opportunity to be able to do that right like it's crazy yep yep yeah leveraging our skill to be able to help these businesses in ways that they haven't been able to be helped before right yeah and tech bros to CEOs I love it all right guys I'm gonna sign off easy thank you you
