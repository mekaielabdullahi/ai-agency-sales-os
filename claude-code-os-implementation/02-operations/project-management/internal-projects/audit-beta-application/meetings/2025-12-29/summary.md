# Meeting Summary - December 29, 2025

**Topic:** AI Audit Beta Application Alignment
**Attendees:** Mekaiel, Trent, Matthew, Chris
**Recording:** https://fathom.video/share/GrGSFj4oKssRhrNnPZmrFnB_D45JNMUc

## Project Overview

The team aligned on applying to an AI Audit beta program (run by Liam/Nick via their accelerator) that offers a 6–8 week, hands-on platform, methodology, and coaching to run enterprise-grade AI audits. They see it as a force-multiplier to standardize research, interviews, analysis, ROI, and deliverables; accelerate their agency maturity; and credibly pursue larger construction-industry clients (e.g., SNS, Graceland, Guardian, Remus Development) while deepening current work with Plotter Mechanics. They plan to synchronize their application answers, tell a differentiated "origin and approach" story, and line up a January audit candidate to strengthen selection odds.

## Goals of the Project

### Apply and be selected for AI Audit Beta
- Submit a compelling, aligned application (20 spots)
- Emphasize unique team story, construction focus, active pipeline, and readiness to execute January audit

### Institutionalize AI Audit as core first step
- Make audits the default entry offer (with "quick win + blueprint" as fallback)
- Use program's system to standardize interviews, business function mapping, ROI calc, and deliverables

### Land and execute a January audit
- Select best-fit client (leading options: Plotter Mechanics or SNS; stretch: Remus/Graceland/Guardian)
- Deliver a full 6–8 week audit to produce implementation roadmap and position for ≥$10k–$100k+ delivery

### Strengthen delivery operations
- Build repeatable processes, SOPs, human-in-the-loop reviews, and automation (e.g., transcript ingestion → function map → validation checklist)
- Increase capacity to run multiple audits/projects in parallel

---

## Project Vision and Scope

### Vision
- Become a trusted audit-first AI consultancy for "boring businesses," with a niche in construction and trades
- Capture rich context (audio/video/transcripts) to drive superior diagnostics and outcomes

### Scope (in)
- Beta participation; one full audit Jan/Feb; audit methodology standardization; ROI frameworks; stakeholder interview playbooks; pricing tiers

### Scope (out for now)
- Building custom software products beyond post-audit roadmap phases; over-automation without human review; speculative outreach to enterprise without audit readiness

---

## Deliverables

### Beta Program Application (per person; aligned content)
- Consistent multiple-choice answers; personalized 2–3 sentence "why" narratives; detailed client info for Jan audit
- Story elements: warm outreach with captured audio, context-first approach, community collaboration

### January Audit Plan (Client, scope, timeline, pricing)
- Defined client (Plotter or SNS preferred), stakeholder map, interview plan, data needs, ROI metrics, risk/mitigation

### Audit Assets and Templates
- Interview guides, business process/function map template, opportunity matrix, ROI calculator, audit report/blueprint format, validation checklist, human-in-the-loop SOP

### Plotter Mechanics Delivery Enablement
- Quo ↔ Jobber integration plan, training SOPs, stakeholder interview question set, PRD draft refinement

---

## Success Criteria

### Accepted into Beta
- Application submitted pre-New Year; acknowledgment + selection

### Completed Full Audit (6–8 weeks) with Client Buy-in
- All interviews conducted, artifacts produced, ROI model validated, executive presentation delivered, client satisfaction

### Pipeline Conversion
- At least one post-audit implementation SOW (≥$10k–$50k+)
- Standardized audit offering becomes default intake; quick-win remains alternate

### Operational Maturity
- Reusable templates, review gates, and agent-assisted workflows established and used across projects

---

## Timeline

### Application Alignment and Submission (Now → before New Year)
- Draft Q8/Q9 responses; align on Q5 client details; finalize and submit

### January Audit Kickoff (Early Jan → Mid-Feb)
- Week 0: Confirm client, scope, logistics
- Weeks 1–2: Discovery, interviews, context capture, function mapping
- Weeks 3–4: Analysis, opportunity matrix, ROI modeling, validation
- Weeks 5–6: Blueprint/report, recommendations, exec readout
- Weeks 7–8 (if needed): Refinements, buy-in, implementation proposal

### Plotter Mechanics Near-Term (This week)
- Prepare Quo↔Jobber switch plan and SOP; stakeholder interview question set; align training

---

## Assumptions

### Beta Program Access Improves Audit Quality
- Coaching, platform, and templates materially reduce execution risk and cycle time

### Clients Will Accept Audit-First or Quick-Win + Blueprint
- Positioning plus clear ROI and context capture will enable buy-in

### Construction Focus Is Differentiating
- Industry pain points (estimating, takeoffs, admin overhead) make audits high-impact

---

## Dependencies

### Beta Program Selection
- Must be accepted to leverage platform and coaching; otherwise team proceeds with own framework

### January Client Commitment
- Need consent, access to stakeholders/systems, and calendar time

### Tooling and Data Access
- Transcripts (Fireflies/Fathom), Quo/Jobber access, internal OS and automation paths

---

## Stakeholders

### Internal: Arise Group Team (Mekaiel, Trent, Matthew, Chris)
- Roles: Strategy, delivery, development, client acquisition, context capture, ops

### External: Beta Program Leads (Liam, Nick; Accelerator Coaches)
- Provide platform, methodology, weekly check-ins, Slack channel

### Clients: Plotter Mechanics; SNS (ties to Graceland); Prospects (Guardian, Remus Development)
- Decision-makers and stakeholders for interviews, data, and approvals

---

## Next Steps

### Align and Draft Application Content
- **Owner:** All
- **Due:** Before New Year
- **Actions:** Individually draft Q8/Q9; synchronize multiple-choice; pick one client for Q5; weave team story; review and submit

### Choose January Audit Client (Plotter vs. SNS; stretch: Remus)
- **Owner:** Team
- **Due:** With application
- **Criteria:** Detail richness, access, timing, strategic leverage (SNS→Graceland)

### Prepare Plotter Mechanics Delivery
- **Owner:** Matthew/Mekaiel (ops); Trent (dev oversight)
- **Actions:** Quo↔Jobber integration plan and SOP; training readiness; finalize PRD draft; define stakeholder interview questions (holistic + inventory)

### Define Audit Offer and Pricing Bands
- **Owner:** Team
- **Due:** Pre-January
- **Actions:** Set base audit price (min $10k; target $15k; scale by size/complexity); define quick-win + blueprint fallback

### Build/Refine Audit Templates and Review Gates
- **Owner:** Trent (framework), team contributes
- **Due:** Early Jan
- **Actions:** Interview guides, function map, ROI model, report template, validation checklist, human-in-the-loop SOP
