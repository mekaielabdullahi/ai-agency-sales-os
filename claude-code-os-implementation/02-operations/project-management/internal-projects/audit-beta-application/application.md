## 4. Which best describes you right now?

(Currently delivering paid audit + implementation work for S&S Wolf Sheds and Plotter Mechanics - both construction/trades industry)

---

## 5. Do you have an audit lined up for January 2026?

**A: Yes, it's scheduled**

**S&S Wolf Sheds - Portable Buildings & Homesteading Solutions**

**Company Size:** 7 employees, dealership for portable buildings, shipping containers, and greenhouses across 3 locations (Tuba City, Flagstaff, Williams) with Kayenta expansion planned

**Industry:** Portable structures and homesteading solutions (part of the $4+ billion market projected by 2028)

**What They're Looking to Achieve:** Transform from a standard dealership into a one-stop shop for everything homestead-related. They need AI automation to streamline customer service, proposal generation, lead tracking, and operational workflows to support multi-location expansion without proportionally scaling headcount. Key systems: Dealer Accountability App for rep management + QR/Slot lead capture system.

**Timeline:** Immediate—we're currently working on their proposal right now. $10k committed (phased: $5k initial + $5k by Feb 1).

**Our Unique Position:**
- Inside knowledge of Graceland Portable Buildings' processes and procedures (their parent/supplier company)
- Direct access to Graceland's CEO who knows Chris by name from his time working there
- Full context captured: discovery call transcripts, expansion strategy meeting, opportunity matrix completed

**Strategic Multiplier:** The work we implement for S&S Wolf Sheds will be visible to Graceland's corporate headquarters, creating a direct pathway to landing Graceland as our next client—exponentially scaling our impact across their entire dealer network.

**Why This Matters:** S&S Wolf Sheds isn't just a single client opportunity—it's our proof of concept that opens the door to Graceland Portable Buildings' corporate operations and their entire dealership ecosystem. We have the insider knowledge, established relationships, and trust to execute immediately, with a clear path to industry-wide transformation.

## 6. How many audits have you completed so far?

2

(S&S Wolf Sheds and Plotter Mechanics - both include discovery sessions, process maps, opportunity matrices, and paid deliverables. Not yet full A-to-Z Morningside-style audits, which is exactly why we want this program.)

---

## 7. Typical price point for your audits?

$10,000 (Opportunity Assessment - Phase 1)

---

## 8. Can you commit to weekly calls for 6-8 weeks?

**A: Yes, I'm all in**

---

## 9. Why do you want to be a part of this beta program?

Development costs are dropping fast - the real value now is in consulting: building trust, understanding businesses deeply, and knowing exactly where AI can help. Small businesses are struggling to adopt AI while their competitors move ahead. Their livelihoods are at stake.

We're a team of 4 who met through the accelerator community and formed our own pod because we didn't want to wait. We have construction industry access (S&S Wolf Sheds → Graceland, Plotter Mechanics, Guardian, Remus Development) and a unique approach: Chris captures professional audio/video/photos from every first meeting, so we walk in with full context from day one. We want to be on the bleeding edge with you, learn the enterprise-grade audit framework, and help as many "boring businesses" as we can.

## 10. Anything else you'd like to share?

**Our Team (4 complementary skills):**
- Chris: Lead gen + professional media production (audio, video, photos at every meeting - clients are impressed, accelerates context gathering). Former Graceland employee with direct CEO relationship.
- Mekaiel: Product management, requirements bridge, process documentation
- Trent: Technical lead, production development, framework building
- Matthew: Production engineering, strategic architecture, systems thinking

**Our Pipeline:**
- **S&S Wolf Sheds** (signed, $10k committed) → Gateway to Graceland Portable Buildings corporate + entire dealer network
- **Plotter Mechanics** (signed, ongoing) → Construction industry stakeholder interviews this week
- Additional prospects: Guardian, Remus Development, AZ Inflatable Events

**What Makes Us Different:**
- We capture rich context (transcripts, video, photos) from day one - in the age of AI, context is everything
- We formed our own pod and started executing before the official system launched
- Construction/trades niche focus - "boring businesses" with real pain points (estimating, takeoffs, admin overhead, dealer accountability)
- Already doing parts of audits in our discovery process, just need the full A-to-Z framework
- Insider access to Graceland corporate through established relationships

**Our Commitment:**
- Make the most of every single call
- Contribute what we're learning back to the community
- Share openly what's working (ramping up content systems)
- Help move the program forward and achieve the results you're looking for

We're convinced that by giving and sharing knowledge - things we've learned, things that are working - that is what drives progress forward. We appreciate how much effort your team puts into making knowledge accessible. We're ready to go all in.
