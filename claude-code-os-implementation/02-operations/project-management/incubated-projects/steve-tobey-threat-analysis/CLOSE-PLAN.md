## Decision Criteria

**Move to active-projects if:**
- [ ] Contract signed
- [ ] Steve (or decision-maker) verbally committed with >70% confidence
- [ ] Payment terms agreed
- [ ] Scope and compliance requirements confirmed

**Archive to cold-prospects if:**
- [ ] Steve unresponsive for 2+ weeks after discovery
- [ ] Close probability drops below 30%
- [ ] 8 weeks elapsed with no progress
- [ ] Compliance requirements make engagement impossible

**Continue incubating if:**
- [ ] Clear next steps defined
- [ ] Steve responsive and engaged
- [ ] Close probability 30-70%
- [ ] Still within 8-week window

## Deal Qualification

**Is this a real opportunity?**
- [x] Client has genuine need (not nice-to-have) - mission-critical comms + revenue pipeline
- [ ] Client has budget or can get it - TBD (ask on discovery call)
- [ ] Client has authority to make decision - TBD (confirm Steve's role)
- [ ] Timeline is realistic (2-8 weeks to close) - TBD
- [x] We can deliver the solution - strong fit with our capabilities + Mekaiel's background

**2+ unknowns remain - discovery call is the priority.**
