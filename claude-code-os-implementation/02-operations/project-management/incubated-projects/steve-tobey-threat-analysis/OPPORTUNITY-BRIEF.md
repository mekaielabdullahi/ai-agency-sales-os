## The Problem

This ex-military threat analysis company has two operational gaps: (1) No secure, structured communication system for their inner circle of operators spread across intelligence backgrounds, and (2) No systematic outreach engine to connect their security/rescue services with church groups and mission organizations operating in high-risk regions like Nigeria. They're running mission-critical coordination and client acquisition on ad-hoc channels.

## The Solution

**Phase 1 - Secure Comms Platform ($15K-30K build):**
Encrypted, role-based communication system with mission-specific channels, AI-powered intel synthesis, automated sitrep collection, and need-to-know access controls. A command center for their inner circle.

**Phase 2 - Outreach Automation System ($10K-20K build):**
AI-powered lead identification for church organizations and NGOs in high-risk regions, automated personalized outreach sequences, mission-specific CRM pipeline (Contact > Qualified > Proposal > Mission Planning > Active), and news/intel monitoring for emerging situations requiring their services.

## The Value

- **Operational speed:** Faster mission coordination = more lives saved, more contracts won
- **Pipeline growth:** Systematic outreach replaces word-of-mouth with a scalable acquisition engine
- **Competitive edge:** AI-enhanced ops in a sector where most competitors run on phone calls and spreadsheets
- **Trust building:** Professional, consistent outreach builds credibility with faith-based organizations

## Status
**Stage:** Pre-Discovery (Lead Identified, Interest Confirmed)
**Last Contact:** February 2026 (initial conversation with Steve)
**Next Action:** Schedule and conduct 30-minute discovery call with Steve

## Close Blockers
- Discovery call not yet completed
- Unknown: budget authority, compliance requirements, decision-making process
- Unknown: full scope of communication security needs (could range from Slack to classified)

## Why This Is a Strong Opportunity
- **Credibility match:** Mekaiel's 10-year DoD/Pentagon/State Dept security background is a direct fit
- **High-value sector:** Defense/security contracts tend to be larger and longer-term
- **Clear pain signals:** Steve proactively expressed interest in both needs
- **Unique positioning:** Few AI agencies have defense insider credibility to serve this market
