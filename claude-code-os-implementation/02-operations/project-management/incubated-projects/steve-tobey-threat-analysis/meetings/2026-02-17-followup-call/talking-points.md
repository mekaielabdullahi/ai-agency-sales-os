# Steve Tobey - 3rd Follow-Up Call
**Date:** Monday, Feb 17, 2026
**Goal:** Get verbal commitment or clear no

---

## Opening (2 min)

"Steve, good to connect again. Before we dive in - did you get a chance to talk with Ro and Bob since we last spoke?"

**Listen for:**
- Did he actually talk to them?
- What was their reaction?
- Did he send any docs/SOPs?

---

## Decision Tree

### If he talked to Ro/Bob about Hawkwood:

**Positive response:**
> "Great - so what's the path forward? Are we scoping a proposal for Hawkwood, Secure Mission Partners, or both?"

**Negative/hesitant response:**
> "Understood. Let's table Hawkwood for now. You mentioned you're the lead on Secure Mission Partners and it's early stage - that's actually the perfect time to build systems right. What would it take to move forward there?"

---

### If he DIDN'T talk to them:

> "No worries - things get busy. Here's my thought: You're the decision-maker on Secure Mission Partners. You said it kicked off in January and you need to figure out how to get in front of C-suite executives. Why don't we start there? Build something that works, then you've got proof to show Ro and Bob when the timing's right."

---

## The Close (Pick One)

### Option A - Full Sprint ($7K)
> "Here's what I'm thinking: $7K first sprint, 4 weeks. We build you a donor/client outreach system for Secure Mission Partners - lead research, email sequences, presentation templates. You'll have a working pipeline by end of month. Sound reasonable?"

### Option B - Starter ($5K)
> "If $7K feels like a big first step, we can do a $5K focused sprint. Pick one thing - I'd recommend the outreach automation since that's your immediate need. We get that working, prove the value, then expand from there."

### Option C - Micro-Engagement ($2.5K)
> "Tell you what - let's remove the risk. $2,500, we build you one thing: an AI-powered donor research and outreach sequence for your Nigeria mission. You see results in 2 weeks. If it works, we keep going. If not, you're out $2.5K and you know. Fair?"

## Handling Objections

**"I need to think about it"**
> "Totally get it. What specifically do you need to think through? Is it the money, the scope, or something else?"

**"I need to talk to my partners first"**
> "You're the lead on Secure Mission Partners - do you need their approval for a $5K business expense? Or is this about getting their input on what to build?"

**"We don't have budget right now"**
> "When do you think budget opens up? And what would need to happen between now and then for this to be a yes?"

**"Can you send me a proposal?"**
> "Absolutely. But before I do - if the proposal looks right, are you ready to move forward? I want to make sure I'm putting together something that actually gets us to yes, not just another document."

## Must-Get Before Hanging Up

1. **Commitment** - Verbal yes on an engagement (any size)
2. **Timeline** - If not today, when exactly?
3. **Blocker** - What's the ONE thing stopping this?
4. **Next meeting** - If no close, book it NOW

## Key Intel to Reference

| Fact | Use It |
|------|--------|
| "7K isn't that much money" (his words) | Remind him he said this |
| SMP just started January 2026 | Perfect time to build systems |
| 3 people spending "a lot of time" on outreach | Quantify the waste |
| Meeting Joel Osteen's church next month | "Wouldn't it be great to have a polished system before that meeting?" |
| $1K = 1 rescued person | Tie ROI to mission impact |

---

## Closing Line

> "Steve, I'm going to be direct with you. We've had three great conversations. You've said the money isn't the issue, you've said you need this. The question is simple: are we doing this or not? What's it going to take?"
