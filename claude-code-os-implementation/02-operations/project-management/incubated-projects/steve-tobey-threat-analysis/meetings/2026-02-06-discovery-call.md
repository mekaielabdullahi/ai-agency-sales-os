## Pain Points Identified

### 1. Communications
- No central system for transparency/syncing
- Weekly meetings "as needed" not mandatory
- High-drive individuals work independently, comms falls by wayside
- Task saturation across team
- No visibility into what everyone is working on daily
- Coming from military where infrastructure was provided - now all on them to build it

### 2. Outreach/Marketing
- "Countless hours" on cold calls/networking with low follow-through
- No cohesive marketing plan
- Slide deck creation takes ~1 day per deck
- Custom decks for each potential donor (no templates/reuse)
- No A/B testing
- No email campaigns
- Low social media presence (security concerns)
- Slow turnaround on marketing materials
- "Not their forte" - operators, not marketers

### 3. Systemic Issues
- Coming from military where infrastructure was provided
- Now all on them to build systems
- Marketing/system building "not their forte"
- Task saturation across all team members

## Key Quotes

> "Our forte is getting on the ground and making things happen... the whole developing all these systems, we all come from organizations where these were very heavily in place with support personnel to make it happen. And so now it's all on us."

> "We've got really quality individuals that are producing. But communication issues are inherently built in."

> "It would almost be a luxury if we had a better, more streamlined process."
