Dear Steve,

Thank you for meeting with our team today. We appreciated learning about Hawkwood LLC's mission and your critical work countering human trafficking and supporting persecuted communities in Nigeria. Your team's dedication is inspiring, and we are honored to explore how we can support your efforts.

## Key Discussion Points

During our discovery call, we identified two core operational challenges where Arise AI can add immediate value:

1. **Communications Infrastructure:** Your team currently manages communications across multiple platforms (Signal, Outlook, Proton) without a centralized system. We discussed implementing a streamlined platform to provide real-time visibility across distributed locations, ensure secure synchronization, and reduce information silos.

2. **Marketing & Outreach Acceleration:** Fundraising efforts are currently constrained by time-intensive asset creation. We can help standardize marketing templates, enable rapid A/B testing for donor campaigns, and make sure you have a multi-touch email infrastructure to reduce pitch delivery time from weeks to days.

## Our Approach

Consistent with our methodology, we will:

- Conduct a thorough assessment of your current processes and business needs.
- Prioritize understanding your operational constraints over generic demonstrations.
- Build solutions on a solid foundation with comprehensive documentation and adoption training.
- Partner with you long-term to ensure sustained success.

## Next Steps

- **Follow-up Call:** Tuesday, February 11th at 11:00 AM Eastern.
- **Pre-Call Materials:** We will send team bios, LinkedIn profiles, and a preliminary integration roadmap (within 24hr).
- **Your Input:** Please share any additional details regarding Hawkwood's operations to further inform our proposal.

We are excited to help Hawkwood streamline operations so your team can focus on making a real impact on the ground.

Best regards,

**Arise AI Group**
