## Must-Ask: Operational Requirements

### Comms Platform
- "Walk me through a typical day — how does info flow between team members right now?"
- "What's the most critical info that gets lost or delayed?"
- "What security classification level are we working with? Any compliance requirements?"
- "How many users need access? Any role-based permissions needed?"
- "Does this need to work offline or in low-connectivity environments?"

### Marketing/Outreach
- "How many donor pitches are you doing per week/month?"
- "What's in a typical pitch deck? How much varies vs. stays the same?"
- "Who creates the materials now? What tools?"
- "What does your donor follow-up process look like today?"
- "Any existing email lists or CRM data we'd need to migrate?"

### General
- "What does success look like 90 days from now?"
- "Any hard deadlines or dependencies we should know about?"

---

## Must-Ask: Budget

- "What budget has your team set aside for this?"
- "Is this a one-time project budget or ongoing operational spend?"
- "Who approves the spend — you or Bro/Roe?"
- "Any procurement process or can we move quickly?"

---

## Close the Call

> "Here's what happens next: We take everything you've shared, scope out the development costs on our side, and come back with a concrete proposal. First engagement would be in the $7-10K range. Does that align with what you're expecting?"

> "When would be a good time to reconnect — end of this week or early next?"

## Quick Context Reference

| Item | Details |
|------|---------|
| Company | Hawkwood LLC (threat analysis / counter-human trafficking) |
| Contact | Steve Tobey (15yr Green Beret, retired 2023) |
| Team | ~10 ex-military operators (MI6, CIA, NSA, FBI, Rangers, 2-star General) |
| CEO | Bro/Roe (decision maker) |
| HQ | Dallas, TX |
| Current Mission | Rescue 300-600 kidnapped women in Nigeria, $300K fundraising, Feb 11-22 window |

### Pain Points (from Discovery)
1. **Comms fragmented** — Signal/Outlook/Proton, no central visibility
2. **Marketing takes forever** — Custom decks ~1 day each, no templates, no email campaigns

### Key Constraints
- Security is non-negotiable (no HubSpot, no cloud CRMs)
- They're operators, not marketers
- Military background = understand SOPs and structure
