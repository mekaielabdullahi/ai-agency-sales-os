## Key Outcomes

### 1. Hawkwood Budget Clarification
- $150K rescue budget is **100% locked** - no wiggle room, all goes to hostages
- Steve open to creating **separate budget** for tech engagement
- **"$7K isn't that much money"** - direct quote
- Pursuing $5.7M military grant + $40M from other sources

### 2. Shifted Focus to Secure Mission Partners
- Steve is **lead** on Secure Mission Partners (consulting side)
- Only equal partner on Hawkwood (Ro is lead there)
- SMP targets C-suite executives with threat consulting
- **Just kicked off January 2026** - still building operations
- More decision authority here = faster path to close

### 3. Partner Buy-in Concerns
- Steve needs to talk to Ro and Bob about Hawkwood integration
- Concern about team being immersed in operations (OPSEC)
- Solution: Steve as sole POC, info flows through him only

### 4. Donor Outreach Context
- Using networks + cold calls to churches
- Connected to Benny Hinn, meeting with Joel Osteen's church next month
- 3 people working on outreach, spending "a lot of time"
- No CRM, no email campaigns, manual deck creation

## Full Transcript

**Mekaiel Abdullahi** *[00:01]*: Awesome. You want to kick us off?
**Trent Christopher** *[00:04]*: Sure. Thanks for your time, Steve. Hope everything went okay. Did you have a chance to be able to pass the material around your team? Just curious if there's any feedback on that.
**Steve** *[00:13]*: Yeah, I mean, it's generally favorable. We're interested in learning more. You know, I got an idea, the process kind of relayed that to my partners and we just want to explore this further. So.
**Trent Christopher** *[00:26]*: Yeah, yeah, let's. Let's see what we can get into. Hey, so before we dive too deep, I was talking to my neighbor. My neighbor is a, he is, he's a friend of mine too, but he's, he is a professional donor seeker for churches, church groups. So he travels all around the country searching for and presenting to and trying to, you know, acquire the favor of donors. So he asked me some questions that I couldn't answer. So I'm kind of curious if I'd be able to propose them to you and see if, see where we're at with that.
**Steve** *[01:08]*: Okay.
**Trent Christopher** *[01:09]*: So he was asking. So one of the things was, what does the ideal donor look like for you guys? Are you looking at large donations and just a few people, or are you looking for many donors with smaller amounts?
**Steve** *[01:24]*: It's easier to get people to donate large amounts and fewer people donating. It is obviously logistically a little bit more burdensome to go after smaller donations. It's got to get in front of more people and constantly have those conversations. So it's better to go with the large donations, but certainly wouldn't turn down smaller donations.
**Trent Christopher** *[01:48]*: Yeah. So he also said that some, there are ways of being able to measure capacity and affinity. He said of the donors. So he said that there sometimes are donors that you might be presenting to that you might be asking for a small amount. For example, let's say $10,000, but they have already earmarked let's say $30,000 for donation. So he said there are ways of being able to understand who you're presenting to and making sure that you're not asking for too little. You guys, anything like that?
**Steve** *[02:23]*: What's that?
**Trent Christopher** *[02:24]*: Do you guys have any process or any insight into like your donors on, like how.
**Steve** *[02:31]*: No. Well, we'll do an assessment on them and try to determine what they're capable of donating. And our asks are generally large ass. I mean we tell them, hey look, it kind of break it down into like by the person numbers. So like you donate a thousand dollars, you're looking at rescuing one person out of this camp. And so that's kind of demonstrating the value of their commitment. And then we have the total ask and so 300 actually were able to get this asked down to150,000 now using a different mechanism that's more through the Nigerian special forces to action it so we don't have to fund anything. Also there's ITAR restrictions and lehi law when it comes to funding foreign military and we don't want to get like hemmed up with that. And so we're working through them.
**Steve** *[03:27]*: So our ask is now 150,000 for this Kaduna camp rescue. But we are, we're looking at millions of dollars to set up our civil military intelligence centers run Dr. Going to set up an office there with a permanent presence. We got, we got three generals we're going to keep on retainer and to start working with them for intelligence sharing and gathering within in the northern area of Nigeria. So there's a lot going on. We certainly use more money but 150,000 for the camp rescue.
**Trent Christopher** *[04:00]*: Got it, Got it. Okay. So another thing that he brought up was that what does it look like with the profit versus non profit divisions. I know it was mentioned maybe that you keeping those two totally separate but the donors themselves are donating to the nonprofit. Is that accurate?
**Steve** *[04:20]*: So the we closed down our nonprofit but we have the ability if people need. Want to donate and have you know, for tax purposes. Yep. Want write offs we have somebody that will take a small cut. We can go through nonprofit but primarily we're working with the Anglican Church in Nigeria. So they're donating to the Anglican Church. They can do that in the U.S. and then it go routes through the church in Nigeria.
**Trent Christopher** *[04:47]*: Got it. Okay, perfect. Because he brought up a concern. He said if for any reason they don't have a nonprofit to donate to, then the tax benefits of the donor are lost and he's. That's going to be a big deterrent.
**Steve** *[05:01]*: We have workarounds for that.
**Trent Christopher** *[05:02]*: Yeah, yeah. So then he also said he was asking questions about what do you, have you been successful in your approaches up to now? I know that you want better results, but have you had successes of getting your donors that you're targeting for previous like engagements and missions and things?
**Steve** *[05:24]*: Previous missions, absolutely. Yeah. We've raised millions of dollars. So it's something that we've been successful with in the past. This, this is just kind of a case by case basis though in this one we're still seeking funding so we've got larger, potentially grants totaling around $5.7 million coming in. We pitch it to the US military. So we're seeking that larger funding, but that's a temporary stopgap. We, we'd be pursuing more donations from churches and in order to get our. Get make this rescue happen.
**Trent Christopher** *[05:59]*: Yeah, yeah. So do you guys have, after you have these successes, do you bring them back to in some way shape or form present to your donors that already donated that this is what your results were or at least take note of the results so that when you go for a new donation you can say, oh look, this is all the results we got from our previous missions and here's our new mission.
**Steve** *[06:26]*: We will generally convey that of like hey, we've done, we've got a whole timeline of how many rescues we did each year and then try to relay that to people they're going to be donating. We will have, you know, our, some of the past successes we'll post some pictures of say the girls being rescued or whatever we were able to accomplish. And so that's one way we can build legitimacy as a company and an organization making this happen.
**Trent Christopher** *[06:56]*: Precisely. Yeah. Showing credibility. Right. So saying that what you promised is actually being delivered based on your donations. Right, because those donors coming in are going to make sure that their money is actually going for what they're, they're donating for and good results. Right. Yeah, that's, that's important. I just wanted to ask those questions because he asked those of me and I was like, I don't have the answers, so it might be able to. I'll take these answers back to him and see if he has any other ideas and suggestions for, to help improve your donor efficiency.
**Steve** *[07:31]*: Yeah, I mean relationships like that are invaluable. You know, I just, I find that just with networking a lot of guys starts bringing things our direction. It's really pretty incredible. I mean, just got LinkedIn with a guy that has a Slack network that's global. It's a massive network of people we're going to reactivate. So you know, things are happening, but the funding side is always a tricky portion of it.
**Trent Christopher** *[07:55]*: Yeah, well, so I would say that I didn't even know I had this resource. I knew that he was somebody that went and did networking and he was seeking for donations, but I didn't realize to what degree he's involved in this. And he like, he let's. He knows his shit at least Based on talking to him. As soon as I brought up this topic, I mean he's got that stuff like locked in. So I'll try to leverage that for you to be able to try to see how well we can help you through that channel too.
**Steve** *[08:27]*: I'd be so appreciative of that. People like that could really make it happen. If he's doing that for a living.
**Trent Christopher** *[08:32]*: Yeah, he's mission driven too. So like, you know, just knowing what you're trying to achieve, you know, he'll help. So I'll take back to him and see what he says.
**Steve** *[08:41]*: Is this something where you want me to either to write something up for you or is this sufficient for you to have that conversation with him?
**Trent Christopher** *[08:49]*: No, this is sufficient.
**Steve** *[08:50]*: Yeah.
**Trent Christopher** *[08:51]*: Yeah. So I mean we're on. I mean him and I take our kids to the bus every day. We go out and have dinner together. I mean it's total casual. I can just have a conversation with him.
**Steve** *[09:00]*: Yeah. Oh, awesome.
**Trent Christopher** *[09:01]*: Yeah, yeah.
**Steve** *[09:03]*: So, yeah.
**Trent Christopher** *[09:05]*: So anyway, I didn't want to dominate the conversation. We're like 10 minutes in here.
**Matthew Kerns** *[09:08]*: So.
**Trent Christopher** *[09:08]*: Mikhail, I don't know if you want to transition into just trying to get.
**Mekaiel Abdullahi** *[09:13]*: So we'll just go over objectives of this call real quick. So we're very flexible in our, the way we work, you know, since we're such a small team. So we want to understand where you guys are at financially, understand your budget and your requirements and then we'll take that information back and understand our costs and come back with scope proposal. So the way we like, we work depending on how deep and how fast you guys want to go. We are a partnership model. So just understanding the technology side of things, like we don't, we want to set you up for success. We don't want to give you these systems and not the support to be able to handle it. It takes, it takes time as well.
**Mekaiel Abdullahi** *[09:49]*: So I just wanted to kind of understand your budget for this first iteration or this project in general.
**Steve** *[09:58]*: Well, I kind of mentioned we have looking for that 5.7 million dollar grant. We've also been seeking 40 million dollars from another route. And, and the, those are more just relationships we're building and might be able to do, you know, on our own. But the budget for this One mission is 150,000. We're seeking that and then from there we've identified other camps where we might be able to replicate this and go after other, some other hostages. So that's what we're, our ask is. And we, it's reasonable for us to accomplish that for 150k, for one camp, for 300 rescues.
**Mekaiel Abdullahi** *[10:41]*: Awesome. So with that, so for us, like, you go ahead, Chris.
**Chris Andrade** *[10:47]*: Yeah. Hey, I just wanted to chime in, Steve. I think so there's two components that we're, we're looking at and guys, correct me if I'm wrong. So, Steve, you have your, what. The output of what your mission is. Right. And what you guys are trying to do. We are trying to help you do that, but we're also trying to, like, help the internal side of your company as well. Like at the same time.
**Steve** *[11:21]*: Yeah. And that was something that was more news to me as far as where the last meeting went. I didn't really know which direction this is going to go. And so it's, I, I now I have a better understanding, especially with the products you sent, of what you guys are looking to do. So it makes a lot of sense and it's something we could honestly use to help with.
**Mekaiel Abdullahi** *[11:41]*: So we just want to be that team to help support that, you know. Yeah. And just come in. What typically happens.
**Chris Andrade** *[11:48]*: That's why the. Oh, sorry. Okay. I was just doing an emphasize. That's why, Steve. That's why we label ourselves and that's why Mikel labeled us as transformation partners, because there's a vision. It's just that vision is down in your line of work. You're, you're scoped in at 500. Right. It takes a while to get there, to walk it, you know, and that's what we're trying to make sure. We are there with you from the beginning to the end. Matthew, go ahead.
**Matthew Kerns** *[12:20]*: So I'm wondering, because the budget for this project is 150,000, how much of that is allocated to other things? And how much of that do you think you could allocate to speeding up the operations with what we're trying to help you with?
**Steve** *[12:39]*: Well, that's 100% allocated to rescues. We're not taking a cut. We don't pay ourselves for this. For rescues like this. We, it's completely, our time is spent on just, we want to serve those people that are kidnapped and maximize the amount of value people are getting out of their donations. So we're not taking a cut on that. So there's no wiggle room on that 150,000 to spend elsewhere, if that's what you're asking. But obviously, if we needed to generate a different budget and allocate our resources in a manner that could maximize what we're capable of doing, then that's something we look at.
**Mekaiel Abdullahi** *[13:20]*: Awesome.
**Steve** *[13:21]*: Yeah.
**Matthew Kerns** *[13:21]*: So if, because if you're. If you're only able to rescue so many people with the current way that you're operating, then I think and like if you could spend that150,000 on the current way that you're operating to rescue so many people, if our engagement could speed up that or help rescue more people, like would it, wouldn't it make sense to allocate some of that so that you can achieve more outcome with less investment?
**Steve** *[13:55]*: Yeah, if it makes financial sense to do that and it speeds up operations and enables us to get more rescues in. And I know eventually driving down the cost, that's something that you'd be stupid not to look at. So we'd be very interested.
**Mekaiel Abdullahi** *[14:13]*: Awesome. So the way we work is usually in engagements of sprints. So what happens is we scope. We scope out the requirements and then put like either by milestone or by engagements of sprints. Typically our first engagements around 7 to 10k just depending on how deep you want to go. For us, like the two pain points that we discovered on the last call were communications and the marketing outreach. So I just want to get into like more specifications and requirements. I know there's. You guys use signal for the communication. Last time I forgot to ask if there's any like requirements or any like security things you guys are looking out for on that side.
**Steve** *[14:57]*: Well, here, let me just give you an idea of kind of what the concerns are. First of all, we protect the identities of people who are rescuing. We also for a good opsec, I mean you guys are familiar with operational security from a military background or involvement with them. We ensure that we're not telling people, here's the camp, here's the time we're going to do this. You know, we got to make sure that any communications related to that type of thing is secure. And so it's a tricky balance of trying to tell people what we're doing without telling them exactly what we're doing. So it's something we have to be very concerned about. And you could potentially put the hostages at risk or the people doing the rescue at risk by letting that information out.
**Steve** *[15:44]*: So that's just one example of why security is so heavy on our minds where we're real focused on that our own identities is something that we try to keep secure. We operate in these countries and we don't want to be publicizing who we are as individuals when we're going in country and conducting this type of thing. Sometimes we use, you know, cover for status as we're going in and you know, we're going in for other purposes so just to make sure that we're safe when we're over there. So it's really a really huge focus of ours is security. So we can't compromise in that 100.
**Mekaiel Abdullahi** *[16:22]*: So security classification level and like just working like any, so compliance and all security and just making sure OPSEC stays internal. Obviously we're not gonna, you know, publicize that and make it a thing. Does how many users are on your signal group?
**Steve** *[16:42]*: We've got around 10 people or different signal chats that we will bring some people in on that are on there for a temporary basis. But we've got a core group of six individuals.
**Mekaiel Abdullahi** *[16:55]*: Got it. Matthew, tried anything on comps, like requirements.
**Matthew Kerns** *[17:01]*: So we. For production software at Amazon, we had like a level of security. There's like Sock two compliance. I'm just wondering what's the, is there a particular level that you, or like a protocol that we should be adhering to?
**Steve** *[17:24]*: We don't, we don't have. We, we send emails through, encrypted email, use signal to send files. So things are encrypted. But we haven't specified like you must use this encryption. We're not operating under like SOC 2 compliance or anything of that nature.
**Mekaiel Abdullahi** *[17:41]*: Okay, thank God.
**Steve** *[17:45]*: That's a good thing.
**Mekaiel Abdullahi** *[17:47]*: I mean, good and bad. Right?
**Matthew Kerns** *[17:49]*: Well, we'll determine, we'll look at your needs and we'll figure out like what's going to be the most, the optimal security level for what we need.
**Steve** *[17:58]*: Okay.
**Chris Andrade** *[18:02]*: What we're saying is that we understand the level of importance too and yeah, so we totally will take that to our highest level of concern every time we have that in mind, you know.
**Steve** *[18:17]*: Absolutely. Yeah. I mean I, I feel, you know, the level you guys worked at and your backgrounds, I feel relatively comfortable with working with you guys and understanding you guys would keep that in mind.
**Matthew Kerns** *[18:30]*: And then there is a needs to know basis. Right. Like some people need to know the locations, like the secure information. So how do you guys, how should we allow that access? Because at some point that access does need to be allowed, right?
**Steve** *[18:47]*: Yeah, I mean that's a real problem. So we're trying to get all our ducks in a row here and we can't let NGOs know what exactly we're doing because that's going to get right to, I mean that there is going to spread quite quickly. So we can't let The NGO know. NGOs know. We're not talking to the Anglican Church about exactly locations. We are only releasing that information at last as late as possible so we can limit the spread and only to the people that are going to go action it specifically. So it's something we're concerned about. And, and so I don't have a specific answer on. I'm not sure how I could convey exactly how that works other than to say we limit the, we control that information. Keep it real. Real. Yeah. Controlled.
**Trent Christopher** *[19:34]*: Overall.
**Mekaiel Abdullahi** *[19:36]*: Side question, do you guys have any like, when we do work on these like the communication and the marketing thing, do you guys have any documentation or SOPs or anything that would help us understand the workflow?
**Steve** *[19:52]*: I'll get back to you on that. Let me, I'll just talk to Roe and Bob and see what we've got.
**Mekaiel Abdullahi** *[20:01]*: Anything else on comms, guys? I was going to move into marketing and outreach.
**Chris Andrade** *[20:05]*: Just a few questions I think we need to establish because from what I'm reading guys is that Steve is still a little unclear on what we're trying to do. So can we just spend a little bit more time to like let's walk him through the relationship of, of that a little bit more. Is there is. Do you have any questions for us Steve, at this point?
**Steve** *[20:27]*: Yeah, I mean it, I, I understand everything that I'm seeing here. What does this actually look like on a day to day basis?
**Matthew Kerns** *[20:36]*: I mean I think I can chime in here like when we, most of our clients that we work with are at like the chat level of working with AI and automated systems. So it's like people will chat with their AI and get help there on drafting emails or putting together proposals or whatever it is that you're working towards. Putting together an outreach message in chat and then go back and forth with the chat and you revise it and refine it. And then what we are trying to do is to improve the speed of the workflow by establishing a standard operating procedure or understanding your current operating procedure and then automating that workflow. So it's not a chat interface, it's more of a workflow that.
**Chris Andrade** *[21:35]*: Executes for you and to help the day to day. Steve, I think that was your original question too is we have interviews just like this and we build what we discuss, then we Come back three days a week determined by the guys say, hey, this is what we completed. How does it look? Oh, refine it.
**Mekaiel Abdullahi** *[22:04]*: Chris, can I take over real quick? I think holistically the way we approach it is after we go, we establish the requirements, get the proposal signed. The way it works is we have an intake process and we, the first thing that we do is kind of like an assessment through some stakeholder interviews. Like the key individuals that we identify could be three, could be five, could be one. And after we have those interviews on the different operating and the different angles, we put that all in a report, in a blueprint to identify the opportunities just from everyone's angle.
**Steve** *[22:37]*: Right.
**Mekaiel Abdullahi** *[22:37]*: Because we know what we know, you guys know what you know. But that assessment is the opportunity for all the eggs to kind of just be on the table to understand the big picture. And when that happens, we make sure that's aligned with what we scoped out with the communications and comms. And then after that we get to building and testing and refining and that whole rollout process is like a very deep engagement you'll have access to. On our internal team, we usually like to pick like one or two key people in the organization that we go into to kind of work with back and forth to get the technical requirements and the back and forth.
**Mekaiel Abdullahi** *[23:13]*: And after that there's a handover process, there's some training and just getting you guys used to the new system and how the tools and the automations that we set up can help your day to day.
**Chris Andrade** *[23:25]*: These are all internal, Steve. These are all things that you guys are using, right. There's nothing that is jeopardizing any communication or anything. These are just like, I don't know, would it be safe to say like your own, our own, your own, like separate communication, right. Mikhail?
**Trent Christopher** *[23:42]*: Yeah.
**Mekaiel Abdullahi** *[23:43]*: So like you'll come into our Slack or our WhatsApp whatever we deem necessary to get to go because there's going to be a level of back and forth while we roll these out.
**Matthew Kerns** *[23:53]*: And yeah, most likely what I'm thinking is like the super secure information we probably won't even touch at all and won't even know about how that all works.
**Steve** *[24:04]*: Exactly.
**Matthew Kerns** *[24:05]*: Because we're just focused on speeding up the stuff. That takes time, that takes a lot of time that you need to do.
**Chris Andrade** *[24:11]*: Outreach, the campaign, building the outreach. How are you connecting the automated side of how you guys can send out more campaigns more efficiently. Right. Is originally what brought us to the table.
**Steve** *[24:24]*: Right.
**Chris Andrade** *[24:24]*: And well, there's so many more other levels to that epicenter of opportunity. Right. And so you kind of gotta systematically just go through it. And that's what we're here for, is to help you identify, locate and create those solutions to all those problems.
**Steve** *[24:44]*: Gotcha. Okay. You know, I, it makes a little bit more sense now. My, my initial thought here is this is going to be a bit of a tough sell for the other guys. Just hearing that somebody wants to comment and get super engrossed into our day to day is just going to send red flags like by with me talking to guys about this. So I think that if I were to have something, I, I like the idea, you know, by if something I can pitch this more like measurable outcomes, a little bit more of a framework that I can show them of what we're actually getting out of this and how it can lead to increased returns. He's saying at 12 months, three to five times the ROI, I think. What would it say? Three to five, something like that.
**Steve** *[25:44]*: Are you getting three to five times our ROI out of it? Something that's measurable like that? I mean, I know you guys would need to get more into the weeds in order to kind of do an assessment of how to do that, but if I can, if I had some sort of framework of like how it's worked for you guys in the past, like what have you actually been able to do and how did you go about doing it and what were the results then? That that would be a better way to sell this.
**Trent Christopher** *[26:11]*: Okay, quick question. What would the ideal relationship or the ideal outcome be for you? Like if we just remove the things that we've like our presentation of what we intend on doing and you mentioned that it's gonna be a hard sell, what do you think would be ideal?
**Steve** *[26:34]*: Well, everything that you're talking about as far as structuring communications and having a more rapid workflow, AI integration and sense. We, we are at the chat level with AI and I think a AI, there's a lot more potential with AI, but we're just using, you know, GRO or Chad, gbt, stuff like that. But.
**Matthew Kerns** *[26:59]*: So in terms of do this.
**Steve** *[27:01]*: All more rapidly like you guys are discussing.
**Matthew Kerns** *[27:05]*: So one example I can share for that we did for a client is it's a industrial printer repair company and what they have one main technician who's like super expert. He does, he's worked on printers for 20 years and then he has an administrative assistant back at the office. He goes out on service calls and he Would get incoming calls from new clients and he wanted to talk to them because he's the face of the business. And then so he needed to repair printers, also take in calls, and then after that relay the information to his administrative assistant or his office manager. So he needed to remember all that stuff. Everything that happened on service call, everything happened on his phone call, and then have a call with her. So he would forget stuff in the flow.
**Matthew Kerns** *[27:58]*: I mean, he was pretty good at it. So he would communicate most of the stuff. But when he communicates it to her, it's like the telephone game. It's like she's writing down notes, she's trying to get it into the software some information get lost. Later on they would have to debrief or like do another brief later. So it was a lot of back and forth. So what we installed is, and this worked for them is a phone recording system. So there was an existing software called Quo. It used to be called OpenPhone, where it would transcribe all the communications, put it into a software that would integrate with their service CRM platform jobber, and that would basically everything would get recorded and summarized so that it eliminated the. A lot of that back and forth time because it just got recorded.
**Matthew Kerns** *[28:59]*: It got all in one place. Where now the outcome is they spend less time on that back and forth and can spend more time fulfilling the service, planning out the next service and doing the other things they need to do.
**Steve** *[29:13]*: Okay, yeah, I mean, that would be a great start. Chris got something to say and I.
**Chris Andrade** *[29:19]*: Think, and to elaborate, Steve is. And what Trent was trying to allude to is we can morph to anything you guys need. Like you guys need something. You guys have these silos that you're all communicating and you guys are talking to develop the same type of plan, but you guys are all talking on your own channels. Right? We're just trying to offer solutions to connect those channels. Secondly, I think what we can offer here is with trends, ability to just network. Like you said, God's really kind of at work here. I mean, Trent's neighbor is an expert at finding people who needs donors. Right. And so however, we need to morph to get your partner's face and for us to earn their trust.
**Chris Andrade** *[30:11]*: At the end of the day, I know you're just one, but we have six other individuals or five other individuals that we need to consider as well. So whatever we need to do to make that happen, Steve, like let us know because ultimately we're in the business of creating that. Wow. That's ultimately what we try to do. So you just tell us what we need to do that.
**Mekaiel Abdullahi** *[30:32]*: Yeah. And just to piggyback off that, like if there's, if you don't want us to interface with the other guys, you could be our poc and that information can flow through you and just whatever you need from us, like we're small enough, we can make it happen.
**Steve** *[30:46]*: Gotcha. Yeah, I'm thinking this through now. I mean this is something that I might want to integrate in my, our business Secure Mission Partners, which is the consulting side. Although we are just starting out on that consulting side. I kind of talked over that last time. This is maybe something to beneficial there. But I again, I think when I'm talking to them about assisting and raising money for these missions in Nigeria, I'd have to tell them more than just they're willing to do whatever is possible to help out. And that's going to cost us seven grand to start out.
**Matthew Kerns** *[31:32]*: Yeah. So what takes you guys time when you're doing this outreach? Like what's the work behind collecting funds?
**Steve** *[31:42]*: We leveraging our pretty substantial networks and getting in front of churches. We're doing cold calls as well, just calling up churches. Obviously we target churches that have funding. We like, you know, do searches for specific churches that are more tied in. We've, you know, we got networking through very well known pastors like Benny Hinn for example. And we're going over to hell seeing church next month to talk with them. So.
**Chris Andrade** *[32:14]*: And do you guys have. Oh, go ahead, Trent. This one's.
**Steve** *[32:16]*: Go ahead.
**Matthew Kerns** *[32:17]*: So I'm curious about how like the overall volume of work. So like how many people do you have working on these things? If you can share like how many people you have working on it, how many hours they're spending and how many churches you're reaching out to. How many. What's the volume of communications in general? If you can share.
**Steve** *[32:40]*: I don't have the specific numbers on how many churches or how many hours. That's something that I, I'm not in.
**Matthew Kerns** *[32:49]*: A ballpark is fine too.
**Steve** *[32:52]*: Again, I don't know how many churches. It's dozens at least. I mean, I don't know how many churches, but we've got three individuals working on it and spending, you know, a lot of time on it. So I, I could get more of that information, but it's not something I came prepared to answer this meeting.
**Trent Christopher** *[33:09]*: So some of the things that I wanted to just touch on real quick is that I'm imagining that if we can get you, we have the potential to be able to help you with lead research. We have the potential to be able to help you with drafting email campaigns and potentially sending those out in bulk. We have the ability in targeting particular, you know, people or groups, we have the ability to be able to help you with asset creation. So for example, your presentations, to be able to create very professional looking presentations that have content without you having to sit there and click around with a mouse all the time. To be able to create those graphics and those professional presentations and more efficient too. Yeah, yeah, exactly.
**Trent Christopher** *[33:57]*: Like very quickly the idea would be that we would be able, you'd be able to define your mission, you'd be able to define the things that you're looking to achieve out of it and that it can help you produce those like let's say 80% of the way there. And then you review and refine and then you are, you're ready to go and hopefully you can do that. And you know, depending on the workload, hopefully you can do it 48 hours instead of it taking days and weeks that it's taking you down.
**Chris Andrade** *[34:23]*: If it takes 80% of what it took to build a PowerPoint, it takes 80 away and then you finish it off with the 20. Yeah, there's just so many more things. And then the voice agents, like I'm sure we could even like if your guys's campaigns, your clients, your churches, if they live on some CRM or spreadsheet with all these names and emails. I mean there's a voice agents that can be used to represent your brand and like just somebody from you guys, just at a capacity that could never be achieved before.
**Trent Christopher** *[34:57]*: And we would approach that, you know, in the right way to make sure that the audience is accepting of something like that. But there's the possibility of instead of you guys making the phone calls, that we can have an AI agent actually make the phone calls and you'd be surprised on how well they do and how realistic they actually are. So if you're just doing cold calls to hundreds of people, you know, you can maybe screen out and just qualify some donors up front and then you come in as the person that gives that special touch to the ones that have already been pre screened.
**Chris Andrade** *[35:30]*: And then we give you the analytics to show, damn, my email campaigns are more efficient and I'm closing more deals or closing more campaigns on just my email campaigns versus my voice or my actual hope, my calling. Because we have the pre qualified or ways to like sift out donors that we can actually make the time that we do make phone calls. Maximize. Because now we have a. A list of high valued client for donors, you know.
**Matthew Kerns** *[36:02]*: So what do you think of that, Steve?
**Trent Christopher** *[36:05]*: I'm sorry, what?
**Matthew Kerns** *[36:06]*: I was just wondering what. What you're thinking because about this part of things.
**Steve** *[36:10]*: Yeah, These are all things I've looked into personally and have actually utilized. We just don't have them. Like we're not consistently using them right now. So all. All great tools that we. We could use to make our operations more efficient. So. I like the idea. Cool.
**Matthew Kerns** *[36:34]*: Yeah. And you guys are focused on doing the thing. So that's a lot. Usually where we come in is just to help get these things installed.
**Trent Christopher** *[36:42]*: So something I wanted to just point out, and I think Mikhail already touched on it, and I just want to make sure that you'd mentioned a concern about $7,000 for an engagement to be able to do some of this work. We can scope down. We can scope up depending on what you need. So if you have a more ideal number in mind that you'd be able to work with, we can scope that down to be able to get you some value so that we can get our foot in the door, so that we can help you get some value and so that we can just start moving forward so that we can start to see even better results and continue the relationship. Okay, so just let us know what that number might be to try to.
**Trent Christopher** *[37:19]*: So we can have an idea how to refine our proposal.
**Steve** *[37:23]*: Gotcha. Yeah. And. And what's becoming clear here to me is that I need to have to get back with you guys and have a discussion that's more focused on how you guys could integrate. After I talk to all my partners.
**Chris Andrade** *[37:42]*: About this, what tools can we give you to talk to your partners? Like what you're. You need us. You need us to give you something to go to them with. What does that look like?
**Steve** *[37:56]*: I, you know, really, since on the Hawkwood side, which is the side we're talking about, I'm not the lead on that. I'm the lead on Secure Mission Partners. So I'm handling that and developing that. And RO would have all these. The more specific information on numbers. Exactly. What's going on for Hogwood Operations. And, And I'm not the best person to be talking to as related to how you can maximize the value of Hawkwood Operations, which is why I said I'd be, you know, more I'd be interested incorporating you guys into Secure Mission Partners to get us get our workflow up and running over on that side. But let me. Let me talk with Ro and see where he might be interested in having you guys integrate and then we'll talk over where the. The funding might come from.
**Steve** *[38:48]*: Because, you know, at the end of the day, the seven grand isn't that much money. But we've got to just allocate some funds towards it if we determine that it's going to be something that will substantially benefit us.
**Matthew Kerns** *[39:02]*: Yeah, I think that makes sense. And then while we're. Well, we're. If we're focused on Secure mission partners and you know more about that, then we can get a good picture of the work involved in the workflows and the timeframes of your operations. And then we can figure out what that looks like for a secure mission. And then we can even use that idea to communicate to Hawkwood like, hey, this is how we work. This is how we do it with Secure mission. And then you can translate that to them with that.
**Steve** *[39:31]*: Okay. Yeah. The. Let me. Can we set up a follow on meeting to. To do that or do you guys have time? I don't want to waste your guys, so give me a time.
**Mekaiel Abdullahi** *[39:44]*: Steve, I'll get you in the calendar right now. What works for you?
**Steve** *[39:49]*: Can we do next week at this time? This is a good time for me.
**Mekaiel Abdullahi** *[39:52]*: Next Tuesday, 11?
**Steve** *[39:54]*: Yeah, okay.
**Mekaiel Abdullahi** *[39:56]*: Can we. I know we talked a lot about awkward. Just so we're. We're prepared as well for secure missions. Do you want to briefly get into that? Just explaining that or like what you're thinking now that you know how we can help. Where does your mind go for that? Is it kind of similar? Is the mission set different.
**Steve** *[40:15]*: Secure mission Partners targets C suite executives, enterprise level businesses to provide consulting services based on. With our. Using our long history of on the ground knowledge and experience. You know, this is where as I mentioned last time, we have the team of former MI6, CIA and a former army general, FBI me in the special operations background and Army Ranger that are working together to. I'm lead on this company. We're all equal partners, but I'm lead with this company. And we kicked off actually in January right before the business conference. So I'm setting up everything needed to. To make this happen. I've been networking mostly so far and have had some success there, but really need to refine how. How operation is going to be conducted in order to get in front of more C suite executives. Determine a plan for that and. And.
**Steve** *[41:20]*: And again, not to. Not to like back off from what you guys are asking for. But this Nigeria side has really taken like predominantly been my focus. So I haven't substantially developed anything that I could give you like as far as a product. So I, I'd like to sit down and do that so you guys have better. Can make a better assessment.
**Mekaiel Abdullahi** *[41:42]*: Awesome. Awesome. And if you have more information or anything you want us to take a look at you have our email and shoot us that way. And that way we'll. We'll be more prepared on Tuesday. Chris, Trent, Matthew, you guys have anything?
**Trent Christopher** *[41:55]*: Thanks for your time, Steve. Really. And then if you need any support, you have any questions, you know, don't hesitate to reach out. Okay?
**Steve** *[42:01]*: Yeah, absolutely. I'll be in contact with you guys and I look forward to talking over this next week.
**Trent Christopher** *[42:07]*: Perfect. Sounds good.
**Chris Andrade** *[42:08]*: If we take the word partnership very seriously, sir, like, I hope you can see that's why all four of us are here. Because at the end of the day, Steve, we're here to build a name to help other people. Right. I've conveyed that to you. That's why we connected is like at the end of the day, that's all we want to do. And if we can help your company help more people, we just have a really cool set of tools with some really cool dudes and we will do whatever it takes to earn your trust. All Yalls trust at the end of the day, like you can count on us for that.
**Steve** *[42:42]*: Yeah, that type of motivation is palpable in this chat. So I. I appreciate you guys bring in everything you got and well, partners. Partnership is in our name. So supermission partners. We. We agree. So that's. This way we work as well.
**Chris Andrade** *[43:00]*: Appreciate your time, sir.
**Steve** *[43:01]*: Next Tuesday and I'll have. I'll be sending you guys some stuff before that.
**Mekaiel Abdullahi** *[43:06]*: Awesome.
**Matthew Kerns** *[43:07]*: Awesome.
**Chris Andrade** *[43:08]*: Thank you.
**Steve** *[43:09]*: Perfect. Do you have my number that you can talk to me if on, you know, offline about the. That relationship that you're developing or your neighbor? I guess.
**Trent Christopher** *[43:22]*: Yeah. Yeah, sure. Actually, I tell you what, I'll just give you my number.
**Steve** *[43:26]*: Okay.
**Trent Christopher** *[43:27]*: And then you can just text me or something if that's fine.
**Mekaiel Abdullahi** *[43:29]*: Okay.
**Trent Christopher** *[43:30]*: And I'll. And I'll just see if we can try to link you guys together somehow or even if for any reason he's not comfortable taking on that relationship, I can act as a middleman to help.
**Steve** *[43:39]*: Okay. Yeah.
**Mekaiel Abdullahi** *[43:40]*: Yeah.
**Trent Christopher** *[43:40]*: So we'll. We'll see what happens. So. Yeah. You ready for it?
**Steve** *[43:43]*: Yep.
**Trent Christopher** *[43:44]*: 740-740-358-3589-0119011.
**Steve** *[43:52]*: All right, perfect.
**Chris Andrade** *[43:55]*: Bye, sir.
**Trent Christopher** *[43:56]*: Thanks, guys.
**Steve** *[43:57]*: See ya. See ya.

## Internal Debrief (Post-Call)

**Mekaiel Abdullahi** *[44:04]*: I. I never know whether to hang on or delete.
**Trent Christopher** *[44:07]*: I know, I know. Like, it sounds like it seems like everybody's jumping off, so.
**Steve** *[44:11]*: But. But.
**Matthew Kerns** *[44:12]*: But.
**Mekaiel Abdullahi** *[44:15]*: What do you think?
**Trent Christopher** *[44:16]*: So it kind of went how I expected it to. I think that he was going to be uncertain about what were going to ask financially from him, so. And I kind of felt that, like, even before went into it, I knew that was going to be a question mark. But, yeah, the financial aspect. Yeah. But I think it's good. We have to start get comfortable with being. People being a little uncomfortable when we mention money.
**Steve** *[44:38]*: Yeah.
**Mekaiel Abdullahi** *[44:38]*: Which is normal. Even me, like, when I'm on the other side, I get the same way.
**Steve** *[44:42]*: So.
**Trent Christopher** *[44:42]*: Yeah, I get the same way. The aaa, man. The aaa. I was like, oh, man. Oh, gosh. I'm like, yeah.
**Mekaiel Abdullahi** *[44:49]*: But then I started tying in, like, what that would mean and stuff. I. That I. I didn't. I should have been better on that. Like, just tying in the problem to the. The. To the money, you know? But it almost seemed like the issue was more he wasn't the. The green light on the Hawkwood side. But then, like, once I realized that, I was like, bro, let us work on secure emissions. It sounds like they need the same outreach. You could take that to them and then give it to.
**Trent Christopher** *[45:13]*: Absolutely.
**Mekaiel Abdullahi** *[45:13]*: Yeah.
**Trent Christopher** *[45:13]*: I think he does. He needs. He needs help with that too. And it sounds like he doesn't have that quite established yet, but he also knows what our price is, and he was interested in shifting it over to Secure Mission Partners. So, I mean, and he mentioned he's like, 7k is not really that much money.
**Steve** *[45:31]*: Yeah.
**Mekaiel Abdullahi** *[45:32]*: Once he said that, bro, honestly, before I said that number and he was talking 150 and all that crazy stuff, I was literally gonna be like, dude, should I say 10 to 15?
**Trent Christopher** *[45:40]*: Well, so. But see, here's the thing. So all the numbers that he rambled.
**Mekaiel Abdullahi** *[45:44]*: Off was for the. The charity.
**Steve** *[45:47]*: Yeah.
**Trent Christopher** *[45:49]*: They can't touch it. Like, even if they wanted to, like, even if it made sense, they can't take that money and move it over to pay us.
**Steve** *[45:57]*: Yeah.
**Mekaiel Abdullahi** *[45:57]*: That made. That's wrong.
**Trent Christopher** *[46:00]*: They can't do that.
**Chris Andrade** *[46:01]*: That.
**Trent Christopher** *[46:01]*: That eliminates credibility and just like, it's just a big no, no. With like, legal things and all that. But Matthew had a good point by driving into that if there's money coming in, it would be good to be able to find a way to allocate Some money that might be from a different channel or something.
**Steve** *[46:18]*: Right.
**Trent Christopher** *[46:18]*: Doesn't have to be from the donations. It could be from something else.
**Mekaiel Abdullahi** *[46:21]*: I was asking for that budget, and he gave me the budget for.
**Trent Christopher** *[46:24]*: I know. He didn't understand. Yeah, he didn't understand your question because he's thinking budgets. He's already thinking about the money he's trying to donate true donations for. But, yeah, I didn't.
**Mekaiel Abdullahi** *[46:34]*: I. I kept the one one. The one. One, one thing in the back pocket. I don't think he was right for that. I think he wanted to pay us, to be honest.
**Matthew Kerns** *[46:41]*: The.
**Trent Christopher** *[46:41]*: Oh, yeah. The one, one.
**Steve** *[46:43]*: Yeah. Yeah. So.
**Trent Christopher** *[46:44]*: Yeah, I don't think. Yeah, I mean, he wasn't prepared to say no. Like, it was just sort of a little bit of, like. I don't know. Yeah.
**Mekaiel Abdullahi** *[46:52]*: But then once I. I feel. I figured, like, once I said, like, we interview a few people on the team and stuff, I feel like he shifted to, oh, it's not. I didn't know you guys were gonna be that immersive, you know? And then you follow it wasn't even.
**Trent Christopher** *[47:04]*: The money that much.
**Mekaiel Abdullahi** *[47:05]*: Yeah. His concern was getting in his operations. And once I figured that out, I was like, bro, you could be our poc. I don't even. Like, you know what I mean?
**Trent Christopher** *[47:12]*: Yeah, we. I mean, he can. He can evaluate it however he wants, and we can just. Exactly. We can just go through him and he can do it however he wants. So it's just a matter of, hey, look, we need this information. Can you give it to us so that we can do what we need to do for you?
**Steve** *[47:27]*: Right.
**Mekaiel Abdullahi** *[47:27]*: Yeah. Yeah, that was it.
**Steve** *[47:29]*: Yeah.
**Mekaiel Abdullahi** *[47:29]*: I think he understood. He understands where we're coming from. I think I'll work with this. It's just giving him a little push, you know?
**Trent Christopher** *[47:34]*: Yeah. Give him a little push. He needs to go back and talk to his guy, and then we'll just see what happens.
**Mekaiel Abdullahi** *[47:39]*: So easy, man.
**Trent Christopher** *[47:43]*: But looks jumping off here.
**Mekaiel Abdullahi** *[47:46]*: Yeah, well, we'll hop off.
**Trent Christopher** *[47:48]*: Okay.
**Mekaiel Abdullahi** *[47:48]*: I don't know what those guys are doing.
**Trent Christopher** *[47:50]*: All right, later.
