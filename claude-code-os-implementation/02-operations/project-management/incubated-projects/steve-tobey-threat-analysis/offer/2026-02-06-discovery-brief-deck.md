**Prepared by Arise AI Group | February 6, 2026**

---

## SLIDE 1: SITUATION SUMMARY

### What We Heard

**Mission:** Hawkwood LLC is a threat analysis and private security firm led by ex-military operators (Green Berets, MI6, CIA, NSA, FBI, Army Rangers) focused on counter-human trafficking and protecting persecuted communities.

**Current Op:** Rescue mission for 300-600 kidnapped women in Nigeria. Target: $300K fundraising. Window: Feb 11-22.

### Core Challenges Identified

| Challenge | Current State | Impact |
|-----------|---------------|--------|
| **Communications** | Fragmented across Signal, Outlook, Proton. No central sync. | No visibility into daily workloads. Silos. Missed coordination. |
| **Outreach/Marketing** | Cold calls, custom decks (~1 day each), no templates. | Countless hours burned. Slow donor pipeline. Mission delays. |

> *"Our forte is getting on the ground and making things happen... developing all these systems, we all come from organizations where these were very heavily in place. Now it's all on us."*
> — Steve Tobey

## SLIDE 2: PROBLEM → SOLUTION MAP

### Communications Infrastructure

| Problem | Solution | Outcome |
|---------|----------|---------|
| No central visibility across distributed team | Secure sync platform with task/status tracking | Real-time transparency without compromising security |
| Meetings "as needed" instead of structured | Automated daily/weekly rollups + async updates | Less meetings, more visibility |
| Signal works but doesn't scale for ops | Tiered comms: secure channel + operational channel | Right tool for right context |

### Outreach & Donor Pipeline

| Problem | Solution | Outcome |
|---------|----------|---------|
| Custom slide decks take ~1 day each | Template library with AI-powered customization | Deck production: 1 day → 1 hour |
| No email campaigns | Multi-touch automated outreach sequences | Consistent follow-up without manual effort |
| No donor relationship tracking | Lightweight CRM (secure, self-hosted option) | Pipeline visibility: who, where, next action |
| No A/B testing on materials | Built-in variant testing for messaging | Data-driven donor conversion |
