## Opening Script (Adapted for This Client)

> "Steve, thanks for taking the time. Before we get into it - I want you to know this isn't a generic AI pitch. I spent 10 years in DoD, Pentagon, and State Department security infrastructure. I built security systems for 15 U.S. embassies. So when you tell me about operational security needs, I'm not learning - I'm listening from experience."

> "I've got about 30 minutes blocked. I want to ask you 5 questions to really understand what you need. If there's a fit, we'll talk about next steps. If not, I'll point you in the right direction. Sound good?"

---

## The 5 Questions (Tailored for This Client)

### Q1: The Biggest Problem
> "What's the biggest operational problem your team is dealing with right now?"

**Listen for:**
- Communication fragmentation (are they using unsecured channels?)
- Coordination overhead across time zones (ex-mil operators are global)
- Outreach bottlenecks (manually finding/contacting organizations that need their services)
- Intel sharing gaps within the inner circle

### Q2: The Cost
> "How much is that costing you - in time, in missed missions, in lost contracts?"

**Frame it for their world:**
- How many mission opportunities slip because they can't coordinate fast enough?
- How many hours/week does the team spend on manual outreach to churches, NGOs, or mission organizations?
- What's a typical contract worth for a rescue/security mission?
- What does a delayed response cost in their line of work? (lives, not just dollars)

### Q3: The Duration
> "How long has this been a problem? What have you tried?"

**Listen for:**
- Have they tried Signal, Telegram, custom platforms?
- Have they hired marketing/outreach people before?
- Why didn't previous solutions stick?

### Q4: The Cost of Inaction
> "If nothing changes in the next 6-12 months, what does that look like for the team?"

**Let them paint the picture.** For a group like this, it could be:
- Missed mission opportunities
- Operators leaving for better-organized units
- Church groups not getting rescued because nobody connected the dots
- Competitors (other private security firms) winning contracts

### Q5: The Magic Wand
> "If I could build the perfect system for you, what would it look like?"

**Listen for their vision, then map it to what we can build.**

## Value Propositions to Present

### Need 1: Secure Communication Channels for the Inner Circle

**What they probably need:**
- Encrypted, role-based communication platform (not just a group chat)
- Mission-specific channels that spin up/down per operation
- Intel sharing with access controls (need-to-know basis)
- Status dashboards for active operations
- Automated check-ins and sitrep collection

**What we can build:**
- Custom Slack/Teams-like workspace with security layers
- AI-powered message routing and priority flagging
- Automated briefing summaries from channel activity
- Integration with encrypted comms (Signal API, Matrix protocol)
- Role-based access with audit trails
- AI agent that synthesizes intel across channels into daily briefs

**How to position it:**
> "Think of it as a command center for your inner circle - secure, compartmentalized, and AI-enhanced so nothing falls through the cracks."

### Need 2: Outreach Campaigns for Security Missions (Nigeria Church Groups)

**What they probably need:**
- Identify churches/mission organizations operating in high-risk regions
- Automated but personalized outreach to mission leaders
- CRM to track relationships with church organizations, NGOs, State Dept contacts
- Content/messaging that builds trust with faith-based organizations
- Pipeline tracking from first contact to signed mission contract

**What we can build:**
- AI-powered lead identification (church organizations, NGOs, mission boards with Nigeria operations)
- Automated personalized outreach sequences (email + LinkedIn + direct)
- CRM pipeline with mission-specific stages (Contact > Qualified > Proposal > Mission Planning > Active)
- Content generation for thought leadership (positioning them as the trusted security partner for faith-based missions)
- AI agent that monitors news/intel feeds for emerging situations requiring their services
- Automated reporting to mission stakeholders

**How to position it:**
> "We build the system that finds the organizations that need you, reaches out with the right message, and manages the relationship from first contact to boots on the ground. You focus on the mission. The system handles the pipeline."

## Questions YOU Should Ask Steve

### Understanding the Organization
1. "How many operators are in the inner circle? How many in the extended network?"
2. "What's your current communication setup? What's breaking?"
3. "Are there compliance or classification requirements we need to work around?"
4. "Who else is involved in this decision?"

### Understanding the Mission Work
5. "How do you currently find out about church groups that need security support in Nigeria?"
6. "What's the typical timeline from identifying a need to deploying a team?"
7. "Who are the organizations you're trying to reach - mission boards, individual churches, NGOs?"
8. "What does a successful outreach look like? What's the conversion from contact to signed engagement?"

### Understanding Budget & Timeline
9. "What's your timeline on getting the communication system up?"
10. "Have you allocated budget for this, or are we helping you build the case?"
11. "Is this funded by contracts, donors, or organizational budget?"

### Sensitive but Important
12. "Are there ITAR, EAR, or other export control considerations for the communication platform?"
13. "Do you need the system to work in low-connectivity environments?" (Nigeria ops)
14. "What's the classification level of what flows through these channels?"

## Red Flags to Watch For

- **Scope creep ambiguity** - "Communication channels" can mean anything from a Slack workspace to a classified SCIF. Pin down the actual requirement.
- **Budget mismatch** - Defense-adjacent orgs either have big budgets or zero budget. Clarify early.
- **Decision authority** - Steve may be enthusiastic but not the decision-maker. Ask who else needs to sign off.
- **Compliance landmines** - If they handle classified info, our standard tools may not be appropriate. Clarify upfront.

## Recommended Close

**If hot (likely, given Steve's interest):**
> "Steve, based on what you've shared, I see two clear builds here - the secure comms system for your inner circle and the outreach engine for mission acquisition. Let me put together a detailed AI Readiness Audit - I'll map your current operations and come back with a phased roadmap. Can we get that on the calendar for next week?"

**Book the roadmap call before you hang up.**
