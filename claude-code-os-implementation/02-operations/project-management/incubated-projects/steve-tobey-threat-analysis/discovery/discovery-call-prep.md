## Opening Script (Adapted for This Client)

> "Steve, thanks for taking the time. Before we get into it - I want you to know this isn't a generic AI pitch. I spent 10 years in DoD, Pentagon, and State Department security infrastructure. I built security systems for 15 U.S. embassies. So when you tell me about operational security needs, I'm not learning - I'm listening from experience."

> "I've got about 30 minutes blocked. I want to ask you 5 questions to really understand what you need. If there's a fit, we'll talk about next steps. If not, I'll point you in the right direction. Sound good?"

## Getting to Know Steve & the Business

Before diving into the 5 Questions framework, open it up and let Steve talk. These are conversational — not an interrogation. Let him paint the full picture first.

### About Steve
- "Steve, give me your background — how did you end up building this company?"
- "What's your role day-to-day? Are you running ops, leading missions, or more on the business side?"
- "What's your vision for where this company is headed in the next 1-2 years?"

### About the Company
- "Walk me through what you guys actually do — from the time a client reaches out to mission complete."
- "How is the company structured? How many people are on the team and what are the key roles?"
- "Who are your clients today? Governments, NGOs, churches directly, private organizations?"
- "How long have you been operating? How did the team come together?"
- "What sets you apart from other private security firms doing similar work?"

### Current Operations
- "Walk me through a typical week for you and your team — what does the workflow look like?"
- "How are you managing communications right now? Email, phone, group chats, something else?"
- "Where does information get lost or bottlenecked?"
- "How does intel flow between your inner circle today? Is it structured or ad-hoc?"
- "What tools or platforms are you using right now to run the business?"

### The Nigeria Mission Work
- "Tell me more about the church group rescue work in Nigeria — how did that start?"
- "Who are you working with on the ground? Local contacts, partner organizations, government liaisons?"
- "How are you currently connecting with churches and mission organizations that need your help?"
- "What does a typical engagement look like — from first contact to deploying a team?"
- "How many of these missions are you running right now? What's the capacity?"

### Needs & Challenges (Open-Ended)
- "What's working well in the business right now that you want to protect?"
- "If you could fix three things in your operations tomorrow, what would they be?"
- "What's keeping you up at night about the business?"
- "You mentioned communication channels and outreach — what prompted you to look for help with those specifically?"
- "Have you tried to solve either of these problems before? What happened?"
- "What does success look like for you 6 months from now?"

### Decision-Making & Stakeholders
- "Who else is involved in decisions like this on your end?"
- "Is there a budget conversation we need to have, or is this something you can greenlight?"
- "What's your timeline — is this urgent or more of a 'when we get to it' thing?"

> **Transition to the 5 Questions:** Once Steve has laid out the landscape, narrow in: *"Really appreciate you walking me through all of that. Let me ask you 5 specific questions so I can really zero in on where we can help..."*

## The 5 Questions (Tailored for This Client)

### Q1: The Biggest Problem
> "What's the biggest operational problem your team is dealing with right now?"

**Listen for:**
- Communication fragmentation (are they using unsecured channels?)
- Coordination overhead across time zones (ex-mil operators are global)
- Outreach bottlenecks (manually finding/contacting organizations that need their services)
- Intel sharing gaps within the inner circle

### Q2: The Cost
> "How much is that costing you - in time, in missed missions, in lost contracts?"

**Frame it for their world:**
- How many mission opportunities slip because they can't coordinate fast enough?
- How many hours/week does the team spend on manual outreach to churches, NGOs, or mission organizations?
- What's a typical contract worth for a rescue/security mission?
- What does a delayed response cost in their line of work? (lives, not just dollars)

### Q3: The Duration
> "How long has this been a problem? What have you tried?"

**Listen for:**
- Have they tried Signal, Telegram, custom platforms?
- Have they hired marketing/outreach people before?
- Why didn't previous solutions stick?

### Q4: The Cost of Inaction
> "If nothing changes in the next 6-12 months, what does that look like for the team?"

**Let them paint the picture.** For a group like this, it could be:
- Missed mission opportunities
- Operators leaving for better-organized units
- Church groups not getting rescued because nobody connected the dots
- Competitors (other private security firms) winning contracts

### Q5: The Magic Wand
> "If I could build the perfect system for you, what would it look like?"

**Listen for their vision, then map it to what we can build.**

## Value Propositions to Present

### Need 1: Secure Communication Channels for the Inner Circle

**What they probably need:**
- Encrypted, role-based communication platform (not just a group chat)
- Mission-specific channels that spin up/down per operation
- Intel sharing with access controls (need-to-know basis)
- Status dashboards for active operations
- Automated check-ins and sitrep collection

**What we can build:**
- Custom Slack/Teams-like workspace with security layers
- AI-powered message routing and priority flagging
- Automated briefing summaries from channel activity
- Integration with encrypted comms (Signal API, Matrix protocol)
- Role-based access with audit trails
- AI agent that synthesizes intel across channels into daily briefs

**How to position it:**
> "Think of it as a command center for your inner circle - secure, compartmentalized, and AI-enhanced so nothing falls through the cracks."

### Need 2: Outreach Campaigns for Security Missions (Nigeria Church Groups)

**What they probably need:**
- Identify churches/mission organizations operating in high-risk regions
- Automated but personalized outreach to mission leaders
- CRM to track relationships with church organizations, NGOs, State Dept contacts
- Content/messaging that builds trust with faith-based organizations
- Pipeline tracking from first contact to signed mission contract

**What we can build:**
- AI-powered lead identification (church organizations, NGOs, mission boards with Nigeria operations)
- Automated personalized outreach sequences (email + LinkedIn + direct)
- CRM pipeline with mission-specific stages (Contact > Qualified > Proposal > Mission Planning > Active)
- Content generation for thought leadership (positioning them as the trusted security partner for faith-based missions)
- AI agent that monitors news/intel feeds for emerging situations requiring their services
- Automated reporting to mission stakeholders

**How to position it:**
> "We build the system that finds the organizations that need you, reaches out with the right message, and manages the relationship from first contact to boots on the ground. You focus on the mission. The system handles the pipeline."

## Questions YOU Should Ask Steve

### Understanding the Organization
1. "How many operators are in the inner circle? How many in the extended network?"
2. "What's your current communication setup? What's breaking?"
3. "Are there compliance or classification requirements we need to work around?"
4. "Who else is involved in this decision?"

### Understanding the Mission Work
5. "How do you currently find out about church groups that need security support in Nigeria?"
6. "What's the typical timeline from identifying a need to deploying a team?"
7. "Who are the organizations you're trying to reach - mission boards, individual churches, NGOs?"
8. "What does a successful outreach look like? What's the conversion from contact to signed engagement?"

### Understanding Budget & Timeline
9. "What's your timeline on getting the communication system up?"
10. "Have you allocated budget for this, or are we helping you build the case?"
11. "Is this funded by contracts, donors, or organizational budget?"

### Sensitive but Important
12. "Are there ITAR, EAR, or other export control considerations for the communication platform?"
13. "Do you need the system to work in low-connectivity environments?" (Nigeria ops)
14. "What's the classification level of what flows through these channels?"

## Red Flags to Watch For

- **Scope creep ambiguity** - "Communication channels" can mean anything from a Slack workspace to a classified SCIF. Pin down the actual requirement.
- **Budget mismatch** - Defense-adjacent orgs either have big budgets or zero budget. Clarify early.
- **Decision authority** - Steve may be enthusiastic but not the decision-maker. Ask who else needs to sign off.
- **Compliance landmines** - If they handle classified info, our standard tools may not be appropriate. Clarify upfront.

## Recommended Close

**If hot (likely, given Steve's interest):**
> "Steve, based on what you've shared, I see two clear builds here - the secure comms system for your inner circle and the outreach engine for mission acquisition. Let me put together a detailed AI Readiness Audit - I'll map your current operations and come back with a phased roadmap. Can we get that on the calendar for next week?"

**Book the roadmap call before you hang up.**
