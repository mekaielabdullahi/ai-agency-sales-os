## SECTION 5: Pain Points & Goals (Critical Section!)

### Top Pain Points

**Pain Point #1:**
ONBOARDING GAP - "We have a pretty good discovery to figure out like whether or not they're a good fit for what we do, and then we have a good execution. But our onboarding is kind of where we have a big gap."

Tyler: "That's like one of our biggest things that we're actually working on as a company."

**How much time does this cost you per week?** _____ hours

**How much revenue is this costing you per month (estimated)?** $_____

*Not quantified - but leads to client failures like Remus Development*

---

**Pain Point #2:**
CLIENT READINESS - "When people hire Concrete CEO, they say 'I want leads.' And in reality, they don't even realize that their business is broke."

Clients sign up without proper budget for ad spend, don't know their own numbers, and aren't financially ready for lead generation services.

**How much time does this cost you per week?** _____ hours

**How much revenue is this costing you per month (estimated)?** $_____

*Example: Remus Development failed mid-campaign due to cash flow issues*

---

**Pain Point #3:**
GOOGLE SHEETS TOOLS - "We have some really cool things that I really hate that they live on Google sheets because to me they're good enough to warrant having like a micro SaaS."

Valuable tools exist (pricing calculator, P&L tool) but aren't being used because "they're not good at updating Google sheets and they're not the most user friendly."

**How much time does this cost you per week?** _____ hours

**How much revenue is this costing you per month (estimated)?** $_____

*Tool adoption currently ~10% - could be 60%+ with proper interface*
