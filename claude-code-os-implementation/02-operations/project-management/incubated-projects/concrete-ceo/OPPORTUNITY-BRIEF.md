# Concrete CEO - Opportunity Brief

**Client:** Concrete CEO (Tyler - Founder)
**Contact:** Via Chris Andrade
**Discovery Date:** December 2024
**Close Probability:** 50%
**Expected Close Date:** Mid-January 2025
**Expected Value:** $6,250-25,000/month (recurring audit services)

---

## The Problem

Concrete CEO excels at lead generation for contractors but lacks financial validation during onboarding. Clients like Remus Development start campaigns without proper budget planning, leading to cash flow failures that undermine Concrete CEO's effectiveness. This creates lower close rates, client churn, and missed revenue opportunities.

---

## The Solution

**Two-Week Quality Assurance Audit Package** delivered during Concrete CEO onboarding:
- Financial readiness assessment (cash flow, budget planning, ROI projections)
- Operational baseline audit (lead management, bid success rates, capacity)
- Risk identification and mitigation planning

**Partnership Model:** Arise Group provides audit services as subcontractor, revenue-sharing with Concrete CEO.

---

## The Value

**For Concrete CEO:**
- Improved close rates (10-20% increase projected)
- Better client retention (fewer Remus Development failures)
- Market differentiation from competitors
- Higher customer lifetime value

**For Contractors:**
- Confidence in ROI before investing in lead gen
- Clear success metrics and timeline
- Reduced risk of cash flow failures
- Better campaign outcomes

**For Arise Group:**
- Recurring revenue: $6,250-25,000/month at scale (5-10 audits/month)
- Strategic partnership with established lead gen brand
- Access to Concrete CEO's existing client pipeline
- Foundation for future platform play (Phase 2)

---

## Status

**Stage:** Discovery Complete → Proposal Development
**Last Contact:** December 2024 (initial discovery call with Chris)
**Next Action:** Deliver detailed audit proposal to Tyler by Dec 20, 2024

---

## Close Blockers

1. **No proposal delivered yet** - Chris creating detailed audit proposal this week
2. **Revenue split not negotiated** - Need to propose 30-50% for Arise Group
3. **Tyler's buy-in unknown** - Haven't pitched yet, don't know his appetite
4. **Competitive research incomplete** - Procore/CoConstruct analysis in progress
5. **No case study data** - Remus Development financials not yet collected

**Primary Risk:** Tyler may not see enough value or may want to handle audits internally.

---

## Notes

**Strengths:**
- Real case study (Remus Development) validates the gap
- Tyler is innovation-friendly (recent AI investment)
- Concrete CEO has active client pipeline
- Clear differentiation opportunity in market

**Concerns:**
- No relationship with Tyler yet (relying on Chris/Linh connection)
- Revenue projections are estimates, not confirmed demand
- 8-week incubation clock starts now - need to close or disqualify by mid-February

**Strategic Value:**
- Even at conservative $6K/month, this is 12% of $50K OBG
- Opens door to future platform development
- Scalable model (more agencies could adopt)
