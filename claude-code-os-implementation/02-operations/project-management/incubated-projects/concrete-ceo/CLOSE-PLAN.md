- [ ] **Schedule pitch meeting with Tyler** (Late Dec / Early Jan) - Present audit package

**Success Criteria:** Meeting scheduled and proposal delivered

---

### Weeks 3-4 (Jan 6-19)

- [ ] **Pitch meeting with Tyler** (Week of Jan 6-10) - Present audit partnership
- [ ] **Address objections and questions** - ROI validation, case study data, pilot plan
- [ ] **Negotiate revenue split** - Target 30-50% for Arise Group
- [ ] **Agree on pilot terms** - 1-2 clients to test audit package
- [ ] **Draft partnership agreement** - Formalize terms if verbal commitment

**Success Criteria:** Tyler verbally commits to pilot OR clearly declines (qualify out)

---

### Weeks 5-6 (Jan 20 - Feb 2)

**If Tyler says YES:**
- [ ] **Finalize partnership agreement** - Sign contract
- [ ] **Move to active-projects/** - Begin pilot execution
- [ ] **Select first pilot client** - From Concrete CEO's pipeline
- [ ] **Conduct first audit** - Deliver within 2 weeks

**If Tyler says MAYBE:**
- [ ] **Set firm deadline** - "We need decision by [date] to proceed"
- [ ] **Address remaining blockers** - What's preventing commitment?
- [ ] **Continue weekly check-ins** - But prepare to archive if no movement

**If Tyler says NO:**
- [ ] **Document lessons learned** - Why did it fail?
- [ ] **Archive to cold-prospects/** - Revisit in 6 months if appropriate
- [ ] **Explore other lead gen agencies** - Could this model work elsewhere?

## Decision Criteria

### Move to active-projects if:
- [x] Tyler verbally commits to pilot audit
- [x] Partnership terms agreed (even if not fully signed)
- [x] Close probability increases to >70%
- [x] Clear timeline to first revenue (within 30 days)

### Archive to cold-prospects if:
- [x] Tyler declines or says "not now, maybe later"
- [x] 8 weeks elapse with no commitment
- [x] Close probability drops below 30%
- [x] Tyler unresponsive to proposal follow-ups

### Continue incubating if:
- [x] Tyler engaged and considering proposal
- [x] Clear next steps defined
- [x] Close probability 30-70%
- [x] Still within 8-week window

## Weekly Check-ins

| Week | Date | Action Taken | Client Response | Probability | Notes |
|------|------|--------------|-----------------|-------------|-------|
| 1 | Dec 15 | Discovery call complete, proposal in progress | N/A (pre-proposal) | 50% | Starting incubation |
| 2 | Dec 22 | Proposal development | TBD | TBD | Research week |
| 3 | Dec 29 | Proposal delivered, meeting scheduled | TBD | TBD | Holiday week - may slow |
| 4 | Jan 5 | Pitch meeting prep | TBD | TBD | Critical week |
| 5 | Jan 12 | Post-pitch follow-up | TBD | TBD | Decision week |
| 6 | Jan 19 | Agreement negotiation OR disqualify | TBD | TBD | Close or archive |

---

## Deal Qualification

**Is this a real opportunity?**

- [x] **Client has budget or can get it** - Tyler's business is active, audit fees are service expense
- [?] **Client has authority to make decision** - Tyler is founder, but need to confirm decision-making process
- [x] **Client has genuine need** - Remus Development case validates the gap (not nice-to-have)
- [x] **Timeline is realistic** - 8 weeks to close is reasonable for B2B service partnership
- [x] **We can deliver the solution** - Chris has audit expertise, Matt can support if needed

**Qualification Score:** 4.5/5 - Real opportunity, proceed with incubation

## Key Risks and Mitigations

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|-------------|--------|------------|
| Tyler declines partnership | Medium | High | Build strong ROI case with Remus data, offer low-risk pilot |
| Revenue split negotiation fails | Low | High | Be flexible (30-50% range), focus on long-term platform value |
| Audit demand lower than expected | Medium | Medium | Start with pilot to validate before scaling |
| Concrete CEO wants to do audits internally | Low | High | Position as expertise Tyler doesn't have, faster to partner than build |
| Proposal timing (holidays) | Medium | Low | Follow up persistently, expect slower response in late Dec |

## Probability Tracking

**Current Probability: 50%**

**Will increase to 60-70% if:**
- Tyler responds positively to proposal
- Schedules pitch meeting within 1 week of proposal
- Asks detailed questions (shows genuine interest)
- References Remus Development or similar client failures

**Will decrease to 30-40% if:**
- Tyler takes >2 weeks to respond
- Expresses concerns about cost or complexity
- Says "interesting but not a priority right now"
- Delegates to someone else without clear authority

**Will drop to <20% (disqualify) if:**
- Tyler doesn't respond after 2 follow-ups
- Says "circle back in 6 months"
- Declines outright
- Ghost after initial interest

**If Tyler declines or delays:**
- Ask for specific timeline or conditions for revisit
