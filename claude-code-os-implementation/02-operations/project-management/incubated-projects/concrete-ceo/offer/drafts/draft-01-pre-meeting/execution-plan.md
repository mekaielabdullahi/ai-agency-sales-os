## Key Messages

### Trust Building

> "We're not here to sell you something. We're here because Vince thought there might be a fit, and we want to prove value first."

> "Our philosophy is simple: if we can't show ROI in 30 days, there's no partnership."

> "We're a group of operators, not a big agency. We've built systems for real businesses."

### AI/Systems Expertise

> "Matthew has voice AI experience from his work at Amazon on Alexa for Apps. We can share what we've learned."

> "The key is knowing when to keep the human touch vs. automate. Sounds like you're already thinking that way."

### Audit Partnership (If Appropriate)

> "We've seen contractors like Remus struggle because there's no financial validation before campaigns launch. That's a gap we could help fill."

> "Imagine if every Concrete CEO client started with a baseline financial health check. How would that change your close rate?"

## Objection Handling

| Objection | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| "We're not looking for more vendors" | "Totally understand. This call is about learning from each other, not adding complexity." |
| "Our AI is good enough" | "Great! We're not here to replace what's working. We're curious what you've built." |
| "We don't have budget right now" | "No budget needed for a coaching call. We're investing in the relationship." |
| "What's in it for you?" | "Honestly? We want to learn your setup and see if there's a mutual fit. If not, we've both learned." |
| "We've been burned by consultants" | "We get it. That's why we start with no-cost value. You see results before any commitment." |
