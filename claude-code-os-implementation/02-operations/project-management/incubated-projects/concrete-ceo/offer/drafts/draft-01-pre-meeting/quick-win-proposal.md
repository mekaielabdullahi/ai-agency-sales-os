# Coaching Call & Partnership Exploration
## Proposal for Concrete CEO

**Prepared for:** Tyler (Founder) & Eric (Voice AI Lead)
**Prepared by:** Arise Group AI (Chris Andrade, Trent, Mikhail, Matthew)
**Date:** December 2025

---

## Executive Summary

We're proposing a **no-cost coaching call** to share insights on systems, AI integration, and operational improvements. This is a trust-building conversation, not a sales pitch. If value is clear, we can discuss a pilot partnership afterward.

**Investment:** $0 (coaching call)
**Timeline:** 30-60 minutes
**Outcome:** Mutual learning, potential partnership exploration

---

## Why This Call

From our Dec 16 check-in with Vince:

**Current AI Status:**
- Chatbot on Caesar's website: Working well
- Voice AI: 7/10 effectiveness
- Decision: Keep human office managers until AI justifies full automation
- Review autoresponder: 4-5 star reviews only, working

**Our Team Capabilities:**
- Matthew: Voice AI expertise (Amazon developer, Alexa for Apps)
- Trent: Robotics/industrial engineering
- Mikhail: Systems engineering (Air Force, Pentagon experience)
- Chris: Consulting and relationship building

**The Opportunity:**
We can share insights on voice AI, systems, and operational efficiency. In return, we learn about your setup and explore whether a deeper partnership makes sense.

## What We'll Cover

### AI Integration
- Voice AI optimization strategies
- When to keep human touch vs. automate
- Integrating AI tools without overwhelming operations

### Systems & Operations
- Lead management workflow improvements
- Phone/communication handling (the Remus Development gap)
- Scaling without losing customer service quality

### Business Coaching
- Financial readiness for growth
- ROI-focused decision making
- Avoiding common contractor pitfalls

---

## What We're NOT Doing

- No hard sales pitch
- No pressure to commit to anything
- No upfront payment required
- No obligation after the call

We're building trust. If something makes sense, great. If not, we've both learned something.

## The Bigger Picture

After the coaching call, if there's mutual interest, we can discuss:

### Quality Assurance Audit Partnership

**The Problem:** Contractors like Remus Development start campaigns without proper financial planning, leading to cash flow failures.

**The Solution:** Two-week audit during Concrete CEO onboarding that validates financial and operational readiness.

**The Value:** Higher close rates, better retention, market differentiation for Concrete CEO.

**The Model:** Revenue sharing - Concrete CEO keeps majority, Arise Group delivers audits.

But first: Let's have the coaching call and see if there's a fit.

- Chris + potentially Matthew or Trent

**Agenda:**
1. Introductions and current state (10 min)
2. AI/systems discussion (20 min)
3. Open Q&A (15 min)
4. Next steps if applicable (5 min)

## Why Us

From the Dec 16 conversation:

> "My biggest priority is just the customer service experience... it's put me in a little niche and got me to meet some really cool people."

> "We want to make sure whatever we deliver has a return on investment within 30 days."

> "We're just a group of dudes right now. We don't know where this is going. We are very passionate about customer service."

We're not a big agency. We're operators who've built systems for real businesses (including Chris's parents' company in Flagstaff). We care about outcomes, not billable hours.

---

## Our Commitment

No matter what happens:
- We'll provide genuine value on the coaching call
- We'll share relevant insights from our experience
- We'll respect your time and decision-making process
- We'll keep the door open for future collaboration
