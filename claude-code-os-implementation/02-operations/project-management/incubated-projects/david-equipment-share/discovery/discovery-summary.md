## Risk Assessment

- Phone contacts isolated (explicitly stated)

### Cannot Assess (Missing Data):
- Financial impact of current state
- Time/efficiency losses
- Scale of missed opportunities

## Key Insight

We have a clear understanding of **WHAT David wants** (CRM, contact sync, reminders) but **NO quantitative data** to assess impact or ROI.

**Do NOT** create financial projections until follow-up discovery provides actual numbers.
