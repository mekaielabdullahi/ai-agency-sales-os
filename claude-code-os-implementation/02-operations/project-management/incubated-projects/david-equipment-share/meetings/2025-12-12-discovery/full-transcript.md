## Transcript

Speaker 1: 00:00 
 David, I was gonna call you but I was like, you know what, let me hold up before I make my introduction because I, I gotta set up for this meeting that's going down in like 45 minutes and I gotta get some studio work done and then B, I just got the call and I gotta get more details. But her level of commitment is pretty real. So let me start seeing, figuring out if it's a possibility or not. And then I decided to hold off on calling you. And bro, I'm not shooting you. That thought was about like five minutes ago.

Speaker 2: 00:35 
 Well, dude, because I got a question for you. You might have already know something out there or you might even be able to help me point or get pointed in the right direction. But I need help on my sales side of being able to organize like customer customers and keeping up with follow ups and stuff like that. You know, I wanted to know is if there's like an AI thing just generated or how hard it would be to create something like that though David gave me reminders.

Speaker 1: 01:01 
 David. David. Are you fucking kidding me right now, bro? Hold on, I gotta record this shit. I ain't making this up, dude. Hold the on. Where is my other. This is what I'm talking about. David, why I hauled off on calling you was for that reason. My guy. Can I call you from another number real quick? For real? Yeah, I'm gonna call you on a number, just answers just so I can. Just so I can record this. Let me call you right back. Answer the next number you call or the next number in like the next two seconds. Hey, Y. Okay, can you hear me all right?

Speaker 2: 02:06 
 Yeah, I can hear you.

Speaker 1: 02:09 
 So this is my iPhone line. I hate iPhones. But the team. Let me emphasize again on this real quick. The team I just got and why I was trying to hold off on calling you because bro, but my team, two of the developers on my team use imac and they're Apple guys. And so I'm like.

Speaker 2: 02:34 
 You know, dude, I will say I'm not an iPhone or Apple guy at all. Like my Google phone is legit, but through my company they're super invested into Apple and they've actually developed a really well, like a seamless system. I'll be honest, I will give them credit on that side. But like it has been fucking seamless. You like my iPad is automatically synced so like if someone texts me, I could type it out if I'm on my iPad and just respond to them and then I can access files like, like they use the whole I. The Apple iPad You know, machines, but then they have it linked all through Google and bro, it's. It's been the most streamlined thing I think I've ever used in my life.

Speaker 1: 03:14 
 Really? Would you know what it's called?

Speaker 2: 03:18 
 I have. No, it's. Well, it's all linked through our T3 system.

Speaker 1: 03:22 
 And your system is called T3?

Speaker 2: 03:25 
 Yeah.

Speaker 1: 03:26 
 Okay. Okay.

Speaker 2: 03:28 
 I don't know how what it took for them to get set up to this point, you know, that side, I don't know. But whatever they did, dude, is fire. I will say that.

Speaker 1: 03:37 
 What makes it so fire?

Speaker 2: 03:40 
 Because it doesn't matter if I'm on my, my laptop, my iPad or my iPhone, I have access to every file and document I need. So like, if you're like, hey, can you send me a credit app? I just go right to my iPad. Boom, done. Or I could do it from my phone if I have no access to my iPad, dude.

Speaker 1: 03:57 
 And then so you're telling me what you're telling me and ultimately this is exactly what I'm pointing my point across the team is, is that the way it communicates to all your other. Makes it easy.

Speaker 2: 04:14 
 Yeah, it's. There's no logging in trying to get to this server like, or anything like, like all the verify, all the verifications are done. And so if I just need something, it doesn't matter what I'm on, I just. Boom, Go right to where.

Speaker 1: 04:26 
 Okay.

Speaker 2: 04:27 
 And done.

Speaker 1: 04:28 
 Okay, so let me ask you a second question. If the help that you're needing off the system. That's so badass. Where's the disconnect?

Speaker 2: 04:38 
 So they don't have the sales side integrated where like there's follow ups or reminders put in. They have something they're building and they're trying to do it under a different system.

Speaker 1: 04:50 
 Right.

Speaker 2: 04:50 
 It's just not there to where it's actually working. And so what I want to be able to do is plug in my phone because my phone has all the contacts that I need, right. And I want my phone to get uploaded into here and then I could send. And then I could have reminders and notes and follow throughs and stuff because I want to be able to just do it. So like if I get done saying, all right, I talked to Billy Bob at Billy Bob.

Speaker 1: 05:13 
 Right? Right.

Speaker 2: 05:13 
 Remind me in one week about the quote. Done.

Speaker 1: 05:16 
 Dude, you know my guy, my guy, my guy. Okay. No, they, I mean, we've known each other for how long now?

Speaker 2: 05:26 
 Wow. I can't even tell you.

Speaker 1: 05:28 
 Three years, bro. That's how long. And out of Those three years, I mean you. It's pretty like honest to say. Like my word is my bond. Right?

Speaker 2: 05:41 
 Yeah.

Speaker 1: 05:41 
 So when I tell you that I legit, as of eight days ago, solidified a team of developers and we just started our full on communication, problem solving agency. Legit. And we have a team. You know me, you know how my ability to be the customer facing. Right. The engagement side, really understanding or being able to identify or helping you. I call it walking out the story to identify the ultimate issue. Right. Because at the end of the day it costs money.

Speaker 2: 06:32 
 Yeah.

Speaker 1: 06:33 
 How do you make somebody invest in something that says that it's potential? Like you're investing in air.

Speaker 2: 06:40 
 Yeah.

Speaker 1: 06:41 
 So how do you do that? Right. Well, this is where I'm telling you, Dave, we have mastered that craft, you feel me? And I can't wait to show you what we just got now. It's just really weird to me about coincidences because this is now the second one as of the last hour. No joke. Because the whole reason why I went down this. And I know I think I told you about my parents business and how they have those dealerships.

Speaker 2: 07:11 
 Yeah, yeah.

Speaker 1: 07:12 
 I. I developed an app for them right at the end of the day and then I needed to figure out how to build it and it's using, I don't want. We try to use. We only use AI to help identify the systems. Right. And we don't want to build your systems off of AI. So what ends up happening is that we custom make you your own software.

Speaker 2: 07:39 
 See, and that's like all I want is I don't need AI to like solve my. I just want AI to manage it.

Speaker 1: 07:46 
 No, no, like, listen, bro, listen, listen, listen, listen. We're taking your whole new level. Like whatever idea you can think of what, of whatever CRM you could imagine. If I gave you the. I give it like if I gave you a magic wand. And I can say, David, if I gave you this wand and you can create something just to get you going, just to get. We call it the minimum viable product, the MVP out just to get some traction and then we can build off of that as it goes. Right? But what would you do? Or what would you need as you wave this one right? My job is to get you in. We have this onboarding process now and you're telling your story. In the meantime, we are working out the solutions and I have a team of three guys, right? I got Mikhail, he's the systems engineer, he works, he's the Air Force. He does, he works at the Air Force he has some sort of affiliation with the Pentagon. Not really sure. We got Mr. Trent, he's the robotics engineer guy and industrial. So dude, we're talking about communicating to your equipment by the way, just so you know. And then. Yeah, and, and then Matthew, he comes from Amazon, dude. Like this dude like designs the E commerce side, right? And the app development on your iOS or your, your phone. Right? And I come, I, they, they, I came into this group because I, I spent a lot of money to get to, to pay for this agency to help me develop that app for my parents. My first day, bro, I met these guys. I can't. Dude, I mean, listen, coincidences don't exist unless they're meant to be, you know?

Speaker 2: 09:51 
 Yeah, yeah.

Speaker 1: 09:52 
 And how long have we been talking about this avenue that I was pursuing? Like months ago, right?

Speaker 2: 09:59 
 Yeah, it was a couple months ago, dude. I decided to think about more like now that I'm starting to get busier and I had to start figuring out, okay, like what do I actually need to be more efficient, right? And then it was funny. So I was talking to Brandon about it and then Brandon was just like, he was like, well, do you should call Chris?

Speaker 1: 10:16 
 Because Chris, oh my gosh.

Speaker 2: 10:20 
 And then, and then I was like. And then my head, I'm like, well dude, I bet you he can help me build a CRM where I can just help me manage who I'm talking to and who I need to follow up with.

Speaker 1: 10:29 
 Oh my God.

Speaker 2: 10:31 
 Because I was thinking about back when you're you and I were talking about it because you're like, hey, like one thing that I've always noticed from sales reps is the lack of like follow up or check ins. And then now that I'm here, I'm like, dude, I don't really have a good process other than David remembering. And I mean, dude, we're human, right?

Speaker 1: 10:47 
 Human error is going to come in 100, bro.

Speaker 2: 10:50 
 If I could get rid of that, then I'd be silent, bro.

Speaker 1: 10:53 
 So this is the way it looks like it goes. Again, my job is not to create solutions. My job is ultimately like, you're giving me gold. Like you're telling me what I need to hear. So at the end of the day, I can't. It's not my position. We have a very strict, like, our onboarding process is so fucking good, right? And after this, like, just so you know, you're being recorded right now. This is a part of our process. Like you're onboarding on our process as we speak now what's going to happen is now you, we just developed you your own customer portfolio and now you're going to start going through our process, my guy. And then what we're going to do is go and we'll have a little interview, right? It'll be virtual. I can be in person. Like whatever you want, dog. Like whatever you want. I would like it in person if I'm being honest, but that's up to you. And then we ask you, we give you some really cool questions, right? Ultimately like just like a straight up conversation. And this is our audit. And then we see a lot like an audit, like we're auditing your, your process of ultimately your plan of what you're trying to do, right? And then we take that back to our, our desk. We, we work it out and we come back with a really cool plan.

Speaker 2: 12:28 
 And listen, before we get, before we get crazy with it though, like, is it, are you guys, is it like a one time fee to get this done or is it.

Speaker 1: 12:35 
 No, no, no, dude, like, listen man, like so the whole plan, the whole. Dude, it's really hard to like do that, right? And say that that's why we developed this thing in a way, like there's no risk for you. Like we're already building the tools, right? And we're already like developing dashboards. At the end of the day, that's what it comes down to. And we're already building. So we are working on construction and we're building agents to cater to construction, right? You, as, as what you do, you're the other side of construction, right? You are actually the fulfillment side of getting construction jobs going. Does that make sense?

Speaker 2: 13:19 
 Yeah.

Speaker 1: 13:20 
 So what that means to us, the guys who are working for you, right, you actually have access to data that we need. So I think it's in our best interest to like work with you here and, and get your going because at the end of the day we can ultimately fund itself in a sense. And then like these guys, we're all working on a shared partnership. It's all even split now because we're doing the work. Obviously, you know how that goes, right? But dude, we are tell. We're holding your hand to build a real scalable idea for reals. And all we're here to do is support you as you throttle it up or down. At the end of the day, the figures are. In the figures, you're gonna know how good your idea is or not because the analytics are going to be there to support it, right? So if, if, if we're building you, your Own custom. We call agent to do your own assistant type maintenance and routines and schedules and you know, ultimately the. What you. You think will work or can be scaled, right? That's your intellectual property, right? We're just the guys to help you, support you, to build you, to create you. All that is you. We're just the guys to support.

Speaker 2: 14:50 
 Because I'm wondering if I could build myself almost like a AI assistant to where it's like, handling all the stuff on the backside. So my whole.

Speaker 1: 14:57 
 Listen, you can't. David. I'm not going to sit here and say you can't. You're not going to sit here and say you can't. Hey, sweetheart. Yeah, she's still sleeping. I know, I'm sorry. I've been busy. Sorry, sorry, David.

Speaker 3: 15:13 
 My.

Speaker 1: 15:13 
 My. My family just got home. Ryan Coy. So. No, no, hold on real quick, real quick, because I really want to finish my thought here. Right. Is. Is we are just here to kind of just support you and then when. Whatever. Wait, what was your question? I'm sorry, My. My kids got me distracted.

Speaker 2: 15:33 
 No, you're good. Except my question was I wonder if I could build myself like an AI. Sorry, Things on the backside.

Speaker 1: 15:38 
 So. Yes, Dave, like, I'm not gonna. You. Yes, you can. Straight up, like. No, not a doubt. Without a doubt. Yes, you can. But to be honest, like, if I asked you what's your usability on AI in itself? Like, give me a scale from 1 to 5.

Speaker 2: 15:55 
 Are you asking, like, how familiar I am with it?

Speaker 1: 15:57 
 Yeah, like, if you rate yourself on your diversity, like a zero. Okay.

Speaker 2: 16:02 
 I don't know crap about it. So I'm.

Speaker 1: 16:04 
 So what if I was to say that after our conversation, I developed a plan that can get you going within maybe three weeks, possibly two weeks, maybe a week. Like, we don't really know at the end of the day, and you didn't pay a dime.

Speaker 2: 16:24 
 Well, dude, I don't. I don't want you guys to work for free.

Speaker 1: 16:26 
 Well, listen, listen, listen, listen. This is what I'm trying to say, bro. I need to build my intake system, and you're ultimately fulfilling. You're helping me out on the other side because now you're giving. You're gonna. If we'll work out an agreement, we'll work it all out where all of us are on the same page. Because now you're not. You're not just a client, bro. You're like a. Like this now you're becoming a partner, right? We're your partner in creating the app to. To mo. To to. So we're calling it transform this quote unquote Equipment Share like industry. Because I know you mentioned something before. You had your own brand and then you had your. The company you're working for. Right. Who's to say that you can't create your own dashboard that you just decided to use and maybe potentially you can sell to equipment share down the road?

Speaker 2: 17:15 
 Yeah. Oh, I'd rather do that, Max. I think what they're building is trash.

Speaker 1: 17:20 
 And so if you can anticipate what they're gonna need and build what you think to get ahead of the curve, and we're the guys to deliver that for you, it's a win win scenario. You feel me?

Speaker 2: 17:33 
 Yeah, yeah, yeah. 100.

Speaker 1: 17:36 
 So let's.

Speaker 2: 17:37 
 Let's try to get together next week. I don't know what your schedule's like, but.

Speaker 1: 17:40 
 Well, listen, bro, I'm in it, so just so you know, give you a little status update on development. By the way, I have put them on. I wouldn't say off to the side. Like, we're still running parallel, but they're not my main focus. Yeah, dude, we busted out our full onboarding process in eight days. And wait till.

Speaker 2: 18:03 
 You.

Speaker 1: 18:03 
 Wait till you see what the version you're going to probably be version two or three of it. Yeah, we. We're getting ready to sell version one on Tuesday to a printing company and we developed a plan to make him. So he pays his investment off in within 30 days. Hopefully maybe six weeks. Yeah, so it's a pretty cool plan, man. And I think timing is everything and we got. And I can't wait to show you, man. And honestly, all I need is your criticism if I'm being real.

Speaker 2: 18:47 
 But yeah, yeah, I mean, like. Because, like, I just want something that's going to manage that side and then help keep me to where I can just go and execute. Listen, like, if I can keep everything that way, that makes it. I mean, that's money to me right there.

Speaker 1: 18:59 
 Listen, man, I'm gonna point you in a direction, okay? You're gonna go. Go to. Are you in a computer? You got a computer in front of you?

Speaker 2: 19:08 
 Not in front of me right now. I'm on my truck.

Speaker 1: 19:10 
 I'm gonna text you a website, okay? Really just kind of learn it, bro. And like, familiar. Like, get yourself familiarized. Like, this is gonna be something that once, like you're gonna need to learn or understand what Claude is. Have you heard of Claude or Claude Code or any of that? No, no, dude, they just changed the world. And you know what's crazy. It happens like every three months now. Yeah, like the pace and the evolution. That's why we can't build systems off of those types of integrations. That's why we have to ultimately develop software. But it's cool because the process of what it used to be to develop software, that's what AI has made efficient. Does that make sense? And now we know how to use the software to. Or the AI to build out your own proprietary software to. To. To sell and that's that. I mean dude, straight up, like start thinking about it and start thinking about what can I do like what really honestly, what do they need? What do my customers need? How do. How like just start thinking that and then. Yeah, I'll give you. We'll work through it. I'll touch base by Monday. All right.

Speaker 2: 20:34 
 All right, cool.

Speaker 3: 20:35 
 Let's do it bro.

Speaker 1: 20:36 
 Thank you.

Speaker 2: 20:37 
 All right man. Appreciate it.

Speaker 1: 20:47 
 Oh my gosh. So David, David.

Speaker 4: 20:50 
 David.

Speaker 1: 20:50 
 Am I still recording? David is equipment share comm. He is a sales guy known for a long time in the automotive or the heavy equipment. So some context, some context to this whole deal is equipment about. I don't know really. Honestly I'm like if I guess it a number would be total something that we probably should look into actually. Actually verify the number. I don't know how we can. So let's chalk that up as something to look into. But we need to look into how much of the contractors that build big jobs like civil commercial development jobs how much of those guys rent equipment. And I'm talking from everything like the whole nine. From turning a rocks into five star hotel.

Speaker 2: 22:09 
 Sorry.

Speaker 1: 22:09 
 Did she wake her up? Do they fit? No. She wake?

Speaker 4: 22:13 
 No.

Speaker 5: 22:14 
 Are you going back in there?

Speaker 1: 22:16 
 I just figured that because.

Speaker 5: 22:17 
 No, it's three o'.

Speaker 4: 22:18 
 Clock.

Speaker 1: 22:19 
 I know but like it's Friday night.

Speaker 4: 22:23 
 Where's.

Speaker 1: 22:39 
 Anyways sorry family gotta give them my priorities. Aiden, where David's data sets come very intriguing and his insight is very valuable because of how much of a demand the equipment industry is not only on the rental, the sales side too. Apparently David has some channel of specialty pricing on equipment used equipment that he was ultimately why we even started talking and about creating an app.

Speaker 2: 23:24 
 Right.

Speaker 1: 23:24 
 Anywho, he has insight that could be very valuable at the end of the day it's another piece of construction that we can tap into and like is that. I mean why would we not, you know especially right now. And if he's just trying to build a basic CRM type stuff and he sees how easy the integration is and if it's easy for us to build out other systems for them. Why not?

Speaker 5: 24:28 
 Oh, you guys want to open your booty and bingo. That's.

Speaker 4: 25:38 
 I got another sled.

Speaker 1: 25:42 
 Two now.

Speaker 2: 25:44 
 All right.

Speaker 5: 25:44 
 You want to help her find her number 12?

Speaker 4: 25:46 
 Shark. No, right here.

Speaker 5: 25:53 
 No, that's 21. Hold on. That's 21. There it is.

Speaker 4: 26:01 
 Okay.

Speaker 1: 26:02 
 What'd you get? Right here.

Speaker 5: 26:04 
 This one.

Speaker 1: 26:12 
 What you guys doing? Oh, so you do like marshmallows. Well, I need go, you know, so fast, though, because they can rip your belly.

Speaker 5: 26:31 
 You can't have anymore.

Speaker 1: 26:32 
 Yeah. So enjoy more. You got. You know what I'm saying? Don't.

Speaker 4: 26:36 
 Don't.

Speaker 1: 26:36 
 Just hurry up.

Speaker 5: 26:36 
 And Stone, you need to eat some food, though, okay? So I'm gonna make you some lunch, okay. Or honestly, I don't know.

Speaker 1: 26:43 
 Was that a cool basket?

Speaker 4: 26:45 
 Yeah.

Speaker 1: 26:45 
 Did mama tell you how we got it? Mom didn't tell you how we got it? Mama said, I told you that.

Speaker 5: 26:55 
 I told your dad, go get some tickets. And when he came back, I said, we better win. And then he called our names, and.

Speaker 4: 27:02 
 I let we win.

Speaker 1: 27:03 
 She stood up and she's like, winner, winner, winner, winner.

Speaker 5: 27:10 
 You lose.

Speaker 1: 27:13 
 I just. He said, joke. You know I'm joking, right? That's why I'm joking. That's right. I'm trying to make you laugh. Hello. See, that's why it's funny to me. It's okay to make people laugh. So dad has a meeting here in 30 minutes. I want you guys to pop in and say hi, by the way.

Speaker 5: 27:48 
 30 minutes to hang out with your children, then you still need to go to the day.

Speaker 1: 27:51 
 No, it's. I'm gonna. I'm gonna. Whatever. Is this a Zel for Danny? No. What? What? Do we need to pay right away? I know. Okay. Whatever payments we need to pay, we just connected to Desert Financial. It's just a whole lot easier. I got my account number.

Speaker 4: 28:08 
 Robin number.

Speaker 1: 28:08 
 We can do the. To submit or use my card.

Speaker 5: 28:12 
 I'm just not understanding. Like, I could have went so many times if you would have just given me the money.

Speaker 1: 28:17 
 And it's just. That's so frustrating.

Speaker 2: 28:18 
 Well, what?

Speaker 1: 28:19 
 It's not hard to add account.

Speaker 4: 28:21 
 What's this?

Speaker 1: 28:22 
 You know, we don't have to transfer money.

Speaker 4: 28:24 
 Exactly.

Speaker 5: 28:28 
 I don't have access to that account. You know what I mean? I. I would much rather it home from our account.

Speaker 1: 28:37 
 Okay. I just. I wanted to connect. I mean, I just doesn't.

Speaker 5: 28:40 
 No, it's just because you didn't get it done, which is why you wanted to do it. That way. So, like, I would just rather just go to the bank and I'll just take the kids over there real fast.

Speaker 1: 28:49 
 Well, you. You can't withdraw.

Speaker 5: 28:52 
 You said you already went to the bank to make the cab.

Speaker 1: 28:55 
 When did I say that?

Speaker 5: 28:56 
 Then you went to go get your phone fixed. You said the bank's right across the street, so I'll just ball.

Speaker 4: 29:09 
 Daddy. Come here.

Speaker 1: 29:26 
 Candle.

Speaker 4: 29:28 
 I want to try it.

Speaker 5: 29:30 
 No, you can't try that. It's not food.

Speaker 4: 29:35 
 It's not food.

Speaker 1: 29:36 
 It's a dress.

Speaker 4: 29:36

Speaker 1: 45:47 
 What? Why can't we. What do we need to pay Rick? Can we just do What I just suggested so I don't have to go to the bank anymore and just literally just pull from that account.

Speaker 4: 46:00 
 I'm not.

Speaker 5: 46:01 
 I mean if that's the case, why are we not just paying pain into our personal account?

Speaker 1: 46:07 
 I just didn't transfer the money fast enough.

Speaker 4: 46:10 
 Correct.

Speaker 5: 46:10 
 But you're saying you want to do that forever?

Speaker 1: 46:13 
 No. Okay. I'm just saying for this once. What do we need to pay right now that I can't give? No, I'm not. I can give you my laptop.

Speaker 5: 46:22 
 I'm going to have.

Speaker 4: 46:31 
 Hey Chloe, is muffin okay? No, she's not sick because she has to wear her card which means she can't play sandwich.

Speaker 2: 46:40 
 What?

Speaker 1: 46:40 
 You don't know if I get my laptop. Why do we need it by today?

Speaker 5: 46:49 
 It's not that we need it by today. My concern is we have now 400. I got need text today saying hey, your guns and is now at 400. So I am nervous about what could come out.

Speaker 2: 47:01 
 That's all.

Speaker 1: 47:02 
 So I can look and it's.

Speaker 5: 47:04 
 That's the thing. I can't even pay with your business because I've already prepaid everything. Thinking you're going to make this okay.

Speaker 1: 47:10 
 Okay, sorry.

Speaker 5: 47:12 
 So if you go to your bank, I'll go to our bank.

Speaker 1: 48:27 
 What up my guy? Hey there.

Speaker 6: 48:30 
 Hey there.

Speaker 1: 48:31 
 So I got this new little fancy little backdrop.

Speaker 6: 48:34 
 Nice.

Speaker 1: 48:34 
 Nice. Yeah actually so I'm trying to level up my. My game when it like. Because I'm trying to do a headshot too. Oh yeah. I gotta start looking this way. I gotta do a headshot too. And yeah, this will help with that kind of stuff. So give me one second, right?

Speaker 6: 48:55 
 Yeah, no worries.

Speaker 4: 49:06 
 Look at. It.

Speaker 1: 50:07 
 Awesome.

Speaker 3: 50:10 
 Hey guys. I just got settled in so I'm already.

Speaker 1: 50:14 
 No worries. What up dude? And my microphone. Not gonna lie, I feel a little ill prepared. Like the. The time that I had other. It is the time I had set up dedicated for this. I got two phone calls. It took up the whole time. But dude, I can't wait to tell you guys.

Speaker 3: 50:51 
 Yeah, got the fireflies going.

Speaker 1: 50:55 
 Yeah buddy. Oh, it looks like it's from my fireflies, huh? Yeah.

Speaker 6: 51:03 
 Yeah.

Speaker 1: 51:04 
 Interesting. Okay.

Speaker 4: 51:06 
 Okay.

Speaker 3: 51:14 
 I think Fathom kind of auto joins too.

Speaker 1: 51:18 
 I really need to look into this. I just not had a time. So I think I mentioned that Fireflies was an accidental purchase. I did it on my Remus Development account and fucked it all up because I don't work off Arena's development in my day to day operations and I.

Speaker 2: 51:41 
 Can'T change.

Speaker 1: 51:44 
 The main email that charged me $250 a year fee to my new email account. So I have to keep it unfortunately underneath my. My own. My own business or the client's business email.

Speaker 3: 52:05 
 Yeah, it's annoying if they can't let you change it. Some of them are more difficult to change than others.

Speaker 1: 52:19 
 Now to be honest, I haven't fully verified that they can't do it. It's just they don't make it easy enough to like look at it, you know, can so, so that's going. So I recorded this other phone call which I can't play wait to play for you guys. Mikhail's coming too, right?

Speaker 6: 52:46 
 I don't know.

Speaker 4: 52:47 
 Okay.

Speaker 1: 52:51 
 How's your guys day going?

Speaker 3: 52:52 
 I'm thirsting right now.

Speaker 6: 52:54 
 Busy, busy man. I mean, just all the time, right? I mean you probably see I'm like always on slack. So I see Matthew and I going back and forth, back and forth.

Speaker 1: 53:04 
 Yeah, I, I do and I, I feel guilty because it's really hard for me to play catch up. But at the same time I was like, I'm pretty sure they'll tell me what I kind of need to know type of situation.

Speaker 6: 53:16 
 The only thing I would say that I would like everyone to kind of.

Speaker 1: 53:19 
 Yeah, I would like feedback on that.

Speaker 6: 53:22 
 The only thing I would definitely say I would like everyone to do take a look at is I put the first draft of the service agreement and statement of work for Plotter Mechanics.

Speaker 1: 53:33 
 Okay.

Speaker 6: 53:34 
 In the Plotter Mechanics channel.

Speaker 1: 53:37 
 So is there a call out that we can set up in Slack that we can do like a. At. And then you put that as like a proprietor, like a, like our to do list as IT team. Like hey, we all need to review this like notification. Yeah.

Speaker 6: 53:58 
 There might be a way that we can. I don't know if like I can put it to a canvas. There's to do lists. Like there's lists you can add it to. So I don't know if that's a good way to do that.

Speaker 1: 54:09 
 Just like for instance, like the list that I had, I had you reminded me of earlier for really understanding what Malik's deliverable was.

Speaker 6: 54:20 
 We do need a, a way to organize the like group to DOS and maybe assign tasks.

Speaker 1: 54:28 
 Right? Yeah. At the end of the day. Yeah, that would Be very helpful for sure.

Speaker 6: 54:35 
 Yeah.

Speaker 3: 54:37 
 For now I can pin it to the channel.

Speaker 6: 54:41 
 Right. Pinning. You can do message pinning. You can do bookmarking, but that's on a user by user basis. So bookmarking is only for the user. Penning is for everybody. The canvas is for everybody or lists is for everybody.

Speaker 1: 54:59 
 And I'm assuming is that a canvas per channel or is there like an overall hierarchy? Canvas.

Speaker 6: 55:06 
 The way a canvas works is when you create a canvas, it actually goes in into a back end list of all canvases and then you can use or canvas.

Speaker 4: 55:15 
 I.

Speaker 6: 55:16 
 How do you say that?

Speaker 4: 55:16 
 I don't know.

Speaker 6: 55:17 
 Anyway, take that and you can add it to multiple channels so it can be one canvas that's on multiple channels.

Speaker 1: 55:25 
 Gotcha. Okay.

Speaker 6: 55:27 
 Yeah, that's the way that the canvases work. I think lists work the same way.

Speaker 1: 55:33 
 List. Oh, gotcha.

Speaker 2: 55:36 
 Yeah.

Speaker 6: 55:36 
 Because you can create there's multiple things or the canvas which basically is like it's a markdown format that you can put like check boxes and headings and tables and stuff. But then lists is actually like a table. Like it's a table that you can add items to as a list.

Speaker 1: 55:58 
 Gotcha.

Speaker 6: 56:01 
 I think there's a way that we can do like an assignment tracker like a. Or something.

Speaker 1: 56:06 
 Yeah, it'd just be nice. Especially when we need like I just don't like, you know, we need to develop these things so we don't fall behind the gun like have our pant like the. Oh. Moment, you know.

Speaker 3: 56:19 
 Yeah.

Speaker 6: 56:19 
 The way that I've been doing it so far is that when. I mean I've been trying to keep up with seeing everything on Slack, but the way that I do it is I just open up the app and it has like at the top, like the unreads and like the.

Speaker 1: 56:31 
 The threads. Yeah, yeah, yeah. And you check them off.

Speaker 6: 56:34 
 Yeah, I. I just go through those. And Slack is actually pretty nice that way that you can just hit like mark red or you can swipe it.

Speaker 1: 56:41 
 It is a good call out. And I'm glad you said that cuz you are, you are right.

Speaker 6: 56:46 
 Like when you want to go through kind of everything, that's the easiest way I found to catch up on everything.

Speaker 1: 56:52 
 Right.

Speaker 3: 56:54 
 Yeah, I've been doing that too. And then can explode if I decide to reply to every single thing. And then everybody replies to every single thing.

Speaker 1: 57:02 
 But.

Speaker 3: 57:03 
 But I mean sometimes discussion just needs to happen and then I think maybe at the end of a thread it's like I'll just do a reaction to one of the things and then Stop replying.

Speaker 2: 57:14 
 Yeah.

Speaker 3: 57:16 
 But I know we can do, like, groups. So we can do like, okay, sales team, you know, is in a group, and then the dev team is in a group. And then at some point we're gonna.

Speaker 1: 57:30 
 Have tasks.

Speaker 3: 57:32 
 For each team and each person.

Speaker 6: 57:35 
 But then we're also gonna have tasks that are related to particular projects or global tasks, or tasks that are internal.

Speaker 2: 57:43 
 Right.

Speaker 6: 57:43 
 I mean, so we have, like, a lot of different ways that we need to track stuff, but we need a way to be. Could actually see everything encompassing, but also be able to filter.

Speaker 1: 57:53 
 Yep, yep.

Speaker 6: 57:55 
 So I need a way to do that. And I'm not sure with our current tool set we can do it. It's just which way. So another thing we can do too is in Slack you can put emojis, and when you do an emoji, it. We can pick it up with nan and it can do stuff with the emoji.

Speaker 1: 58:19 
 Oh, gotcha. So we associate, we create like a cheat sheet of emojis is what you're saying. Oh, my God. We all. We create our own language and emojis.

Speaker 6: 58:32 
 Checkbox that's not done yet would be like, add it to the to do list or something.

Speaker 1: 58:37 
 We could create our own, like, language, like under code.

Speaker 6: 58:45 
 And it was just automate things.

Speaker 1: 58:46 
 Right.

Speaker 6: 58:46 
 So you just create like an emoji.

Speaker 1: 58:49 
 Right?

Speaker 6: 58:50 
 You put the emoji in it.

Speaker 1: 58:52 
 Yeah. Oh, let me make sure. Well, any. Any update on you? Is he probably in work right now, I presume.

Speaker 2: 59:05 
 Probably.

Speaker 3: 59:06 
 Or he might be 5pm for him, 5:15. So it might be like, transitioning between things.

Speaker 1: 59:12 
 It was my fault, honestly, because I'm the one who dropped the ball on scheduling the time. And I. And I saw that message come in this morning at the middle of my freaking daughter's lunch stew.

Speaker 6: 59:27 
 Oh, yeah, yeah, it works. I just thought I'd remind you about it because we talked about donut.

Speaker 1: 59:32 
 No, and I appreciate that. Hey, man, like, listen, that's what we're here for, right? Yeah.

Speaker 6: 59:39 
 Because we're all busy doing a lot of stuff.

Speaker 1: 59:41 
 Yeah. Call me out. Okay, where is that? Now that's scaring me. Okay, machine is in there. Where is David? Is it still processing?

Speaker 3: 59:59 
 Chris, you mentioned there was like a Kanban or like some sort of screen like that in Slack. I was thinking maybe we could do one of those, like, per channel. And then for the all AI Agency, we do one of those. I'm not sure if this is possible, but we do one of those for, like, the high level.
