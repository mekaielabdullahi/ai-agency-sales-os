## What David Requested (Verified from Transcript)

| Request | Direct Quote | Line |
|---------|--------------|------|
| CRM for sales | "I need help on my sales side of being able to organize like customers" | 22 |
| Phone sync | "I want my phone to get uploaded into here" | 82 |
| Follow-up reminders | "Remind me in one week about the quote. Done." | 88 |
| AI assistant | "AI assistant to where it's like, handling all the stuff on the backside" | 172 |
| Execute without admin | "I just want to be able to just do it... just go and execute" | 232 |

## Current State (Per David)

### What Works:
- **T3 System** - "Most streamlined thing I've ever used" for files (line 34)

### What's Broken:
- **No sales CRM** - "They don't have the sales side integrated" (line 76)
- **Memory-based follow-ups** - "I don't really have a good process other than David remembering" (line 148)
- **Equipment Share's solution** - "I think what they're building is trash" (line 208)

---

## Proposed Solution (Phase 1 MVP)

Based on David's requests:
1. Phone contact sync to CRM
2. Follow-up reminder system
3. Basic pipeline visibility

*Technical approach proposed by Chris: Proprietary software, not AI-dependent*
