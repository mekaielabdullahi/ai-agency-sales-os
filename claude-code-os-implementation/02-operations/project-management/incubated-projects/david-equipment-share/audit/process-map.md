## Verified Information (From Transcript)

### What David Explicitly Stated:

1. **No CRM Integration**
   > "They don't have the sales side integrated where like there's follow ups or reminders put in" (line 76)

2. **Follow-ups Based on Memory**
   > "I don't really have a good process other than David remembering" (line 148)

3. **Wants Phone Contact Sync**
   > "I want my phone to get uploaded into here and then I could send... reminders and notes and follow throughs" (line 82)

4. **Simple Reminder Workflow Desired**
   > "If I get done saying, all right, I talked to Billy Bob... Remind me in one week about the quote. Done." (line 88)

5. **AI Knowledge Level**
   > "I don't know crap about it" - self-rated zero on AI familiarity (line 196)

6. **Current System (T3) Works for Files**
   > "It's all linked through our T3 system... I have access to every file and document I need" (line 58)
   > "It's been the most streamlined thing I think I've ever used in my life" (line 34)

7. **Equipment Share's Internal Tool**
   > "I think what they're building is trash" (line 208)

## Current Sales Process (Based on Transcript)

### What We Know:

```
Lead/Contact → Phone Call → Quote Discussion → Follow-up Needed → ???
                                                      ↓
                                            "David remembering"
```

### Process Gaps Identified:

| Gap | Source | Impact |
|-----|--------|--------|
| No follow-up reminders | Line 76: "They don't have the sales side integrated" | Missed opportunities (quantity UNKNOWN) |
| Phone contacts not synced | Line 82: "I want my phone to get uploaded" | Manual lookup required |
| No systematic approach | Line 148: "I don't really have a good process" | Reliance on memory |

## Current Technology Stack

### What's Working (T3 System):
- Cross-device file access (iPad, iPhone, laptop)
- Document sharing
- "Seamless" connectivity (David's word)

### What's Missing (Per David):
- Sales-side integration
- Follow-up reminders
- Contact sync from phone to CRM
- Notes and task management for sales

---

## UNKNOWN - Needs Follow-up

The following information was **NOT provided** in the discovery call and should be gathered:

| Unknown | Why It Matters |
|---------|----------------|
| Hours per week spent on sales activities | Cannot calculate time savings |
| Number of contacts/customers | Cannot size database requirements |
| Average deal size | Cannot calculate revenue impact |
| Deals per month | Cannot estimate pipeline volume |
| Current close rate | Cannot project improvements |
| Time spent on manual follow-ups | Cannot quantify efficiency gains |
| Number of missed opportunities | Cannot calculate lost revenue |

## Desired Future State (Per David)

### What David Wants:

1. **Phone Sync**
   > "I want my phone to get uploaded into here" (line 82)

2. **Reminder System**
   > "Remind me in one week about the quote. Done." (line 88)

3. **AI to Manage Backend**
   > "I wonder if I could build myself almost like a AI assistant to where it's like, handling all the stuff on the backside" (line 172)

4. **Minimal Admin, Maximum Execution**
   > "I just want to be able to just do it... just go and execute" (line 232)

---

## Process Transformation Requirements

### Phase 1: Core CRM (Per Chris's Proposal)
1. Contact synchronization from phone
2. Basic follow-up reminders
3. Simple pipeline view

*Timeline mentioned: "maybe three weeks, possibly two weeks, maybe a week" (line 199)*

### Phase 2+: To Be Scoped
- Additional features TBD based on follow-up discovery

---

## Financial Impact

### CANNOT BE CALCULATED - Missing Data:
- ❌ Weekly/annual revenue
- ❌ Deal volume and size
- ❌ Time spent on current processes
- ❌ Quantity of missed opportunities
- ❌ Current vs. target close rates

**Action Required:** Schedule follow-up call to gather quantitative data before estimating ROI.

## Risk Assessment

### Verified Risks:
- **Single point of failure** - All customer knowledge in David's head (inferred from "David remembering")
- **No systematic follow-up** - Explicitly stated as missing

### Unverified Risks (Need Confirmation):
- Business continuity if David unavailable
- Competitive position relative to others
- Scale limitations

---

## Conclusion

David's current process lacks:
1. CRM integration for sales
2. Follow-up reminder system
3. Phone contact sync

**What we DO NOT know:**
- Any financial metrics
- Time estimates
- Volume/scale numbers
- ROI projections

**Next Step:** Conduct follow-up discovery to gather quantitative data before creating financial projections.
