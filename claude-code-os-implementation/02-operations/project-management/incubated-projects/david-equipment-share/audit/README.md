---

## Executive Summary

### What We Know (Verified):
- **David needs a CRM** - No sales-side integration currently exists
- **Follow-ups rely on memory** - "I don't really have a good process other than David remembering"
- **Phone contacts not synced** - David wants contacts uploaded to a system
- **Equipment Share's T3 works for files** - But lacks sales features
- **Equipment Share's internal solution is "trash"** - Per David

### What We Don't Know:
- Financial metrics (revenue, deal size, volume)
- Time allocations (hours/week on activities)
- Scale metrics (contact count, deals per month)
- ROI projections (cannot calculate without data)

**Status:** Qualitative analysis complete. Quantitative data required for financial projections.

## What This Audit Does NOT Include

### No Fabricated Metrics:
- ❌ No dollar amounts for lost revenue
- ❌ No hours/week estimates (not provided)
- ❌ No ROI calculations (data missing)
- ❌ No percentage improvements (no baseline)

### Why:
David did not provide quantitative data in the discovery call. All financial projections would be fabricated. We document what we know and what requires follow-up.

*Timeline per Chris: "maybe three weeks, possibly two weeks, maybe a week"*

### Phase 2+: TBD
- Requires follow-up discovery
- Scope depends on Phase 1 results

## Next Steps

1. **Schedule follow-up discovery** - Focus on quantitative data
2. **Gather baseline metrics** - Contacts, deals, time, revenue
