## Gap Analysis: Root Causes

### GAP 1: Proposal Work Consuming Delivery Capacity

**Evidence:**
- January KPI: 0 paid projects delivered (red status)
- Team stretched between Xigent proposal, SNS dev, Plotter delivery
- Phase 1 completion unlocks Phase 2 revenue, but Phase 1 not finishing

**Impact:** Can't collect Phase 2 payments without Phase 1 delivery proof

**Fix:**
- Block 60% of dev time for DELIVERY (not proposals)
- Finish Plotter Phase 1 bug fixes by Wednesday
- Ship SNS QR code MVP before more discovery calls

---

### GAP 2: No Systematic Outreach Execution

**Evidence:**
- Skills exist (client-outreach skill: 583 lines) but no weekly metrics
- Stated targets: 60-80 outreach/week, 15-20% response rate
- Actual: No documented weekly tracking

**Impact:** Pipeline not growing while closing current deals

**Fix:**
- Block 2 hours daily for outreach (mornings)
- Track: Messages sent → Responses → Discovery calls → Audits → Proposals
- Use Notion pipeline with temperature tracking (already started)

---

### GAP 3: Content Strategy Stalled

**Evidence:**
- January 2025 plan drafted but execution unclear
- Target: 3 posts/week, actual: likely <2
- No documented leads from content

**Impact:** Missing inbound lead generation while burning on outbound

**Fix:**
- Use `/publish` skill to ship 2-3 posts this week
- Focus on build-in-public (Plotter success story, client wins)
- Track: Posts → Impressions → Profile visits → DMs

---

### GAP 4: Missing Weekly Revenue Dashboard

**Evidence:**
- No central view of: pipeline by stage, conversion rates, revenue vs target
- Metrics scattered across meeting notes and KPI files

**Impact:** Can't identify bottlenecks or measure progress

**Fix:**
- Run `/dashboard` weekly for consolidated view
- Track cumulative revenue vs $50K goal
- Pipeline stage progression visibility

---

### GAP 5: Pricing Not Maximized

**Evidence:**
- Man-week rate: $3,000 (conservative)
- Phase 2 tiers: $15K → $28K → $42K options
- Currently defaulting to lower tiers

**Impact:** Same work, less revenue

**Fix:**
- Lead with "Growth Tier" ($28K) as default recommendation
- Foundation tier ($15K) as fallback, not starting point
- Anchor high, negotiate down only if needed

---

## Validated ROI Metrics (Use in Proposals)

### Plotter Mechanix (Proven)

- Phase 1 ROI: 442% first year
- Payback period: 9.6 weeks
- Time saved: 7-9 hrs/week (scaling to 30-40)
- Annual value created: $27,100

### Pricing Benchmarks

| Man-week | $3,000 |
| Stakeholder interview | $100-200 |
| Quick win sprint | $2,000 |
