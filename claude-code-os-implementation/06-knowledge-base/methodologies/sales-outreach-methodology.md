## Overview

This methodology prioritizes quality over quantity, focusing on personalized, value-first outreach that builds genuine relationships.

**Core Principles**:
- 10 perfect messages > 100 generic ones
- Lead with value, not sales pitch
- Build relationships, not transactions
- Systematic but human

## The 5-Step Methodology

### Step 1: Target Identification (ICP Definition)

**Ideal Client Profile (ICP) Components**:
- Company size (employees, revenue)
- Industry/sector
- Role/decision-maker title
- Pain signals (what they mention/post about)
- Budget indicators

**For AriseGroup.ai**:
- **Primary**: Small business founders (20-100 employees)
- **Secondary**: Nonprofit leaders
- **Industries**: Professional services, consulting, agencies
- **Pain Points**: Manual processes, AI confusion, operational inefficiency
- **Budget**: $5K-20K project capacity

**Research Process** (10-12 min per prospect):
1. LinkedIn profile review (2 min)
2. Company website check (2 min)
3. Recent posts/activity (3 min)
4. Pain signal identification (2 min)
5. Personalization hook discovery (3 min)

---

### Step 2: List Building (Quality Over Quantity)

**Weekly Target**: 30-40 high-quality prospects
**Daily Target**: 6-8 prospects researched and added

**Spreadsheet Structure**:
| Name | Title | Company | LinkedIn | Pain Signal | Hook | Priority | Status |

**Sources**:
- LinkedIn advanced search
- Your existing network
- Post engagement (who likes/comments on relevant content)
- Industry groups
- Referrals

**Qualification Criteria**:
- ✅ Fits ICP (size, industry)
- ✅ Shows AI interest (posts, job listings)
- ✅ Accessible (active on LinkedIn)
- ✅ Has pain signal (mentioned challenge)
- ✅ Timing indicators (hiring, growing, changing)

### Step 3: Message Personalization (The Critical Step)

**Time Per Message**: 10-12 minutes
- Research: 3-4 min
- Drafting: 4-5 min
- Review/send: 2-3 min

**Message Framework**:

**Hook** (Line 1-2):
- Specific observation about THEM
- Not about you
- Genuine, not flattery

**Credibility** (Line 3-4):
- Brief relevant background
- Why you can help
- Build trust quickly

**Value Offer** (Line 5-6):
- What they get (specific)
- No generic pitches
- Free, valuable, no strings

**CTA** (Line 7):
- Low-friction next step
- Easy to say yes
- Clear action

**LinkedIn Message Template**:
```
