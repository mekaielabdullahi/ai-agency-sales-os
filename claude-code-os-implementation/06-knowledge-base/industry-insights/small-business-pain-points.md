## Sales Approach for Small Business

### Discovery Focus
1. Where do you spend most time?
2. What manual processes frustrate you?
3. Where do errors/delays happen?
4. What would 10 extra hours/week let you do?

### Positioning
- Systematic, not scattered
- Quick wins, not transformation
- Augmentation, not replacement
- Proven, not experimental
