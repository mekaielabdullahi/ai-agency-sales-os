## The 5 Question Types

### 1. Time Questions
- "Where does your time go each day/week?"
- "What takes longer than it should?"
- "What repetitive tasks eat up hours?"

### 2. Friction Questions
- "What's your biggest operational frustration?"
- "Where do things break down or slow down?"
- "What manual processes drive you crazy?"

### 3. Impact Questions
- "What happens when [process] fails?"
- "How much does [inefficiency] cost you?"
- "What could you do with 10 extra hours/week?"

### 4. Attempted Solution Questions
- "Have you tried to fix this? What happened?"
- "What tools have you explored?"
- "What's blocking you from solving this?"

### 5. Priority Questions
- "If you could fix one thing, what would it be?"
- "What's the most urgent challenge?"
- "What's preventing you from [their stated goal]?"

## Quantification Technique

**Always Ask**:
- "How often does this happen?"
- "How many hours per week/month?"
- "How many people are affected?"
- "What does this cost you?"

**Calculate**:
```
Annual Cost = (Hours/week × Hourly rate × 52) + (Error cost × Frequency)
```

**Example**:
Manual proposal creation: 8 hours/week × $100/hr × 52 weeks = $41,600/year
