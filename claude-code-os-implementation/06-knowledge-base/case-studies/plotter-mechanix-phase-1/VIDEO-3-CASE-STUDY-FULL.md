## Strategic Context

**Channel Strategy:**
- AriseGroup YouTube = ONE flagship video explaining mission + partner roles
- This case study IS that flagship video
- **Funnel:** This video → AriseGroup website → consultation booking

**Content Philosophy:**
- **Outcome-focused communication** - lead with business results, not technical features
- Frame everything as: Investment → Return (e.g., "$5K → $73K")
- Avoid being "too smart" - make it accessible to business owners
- Show the human element alongside the technical process

---

## Title Options (Outcome-Focused)

- "We Turned $5,000 Into $73,000 Annual Savings (Full Case Study)"
- "How We Saved a $750K Business 35+ Hours a Week"
- "From Chaos to Control: The AriseGroup Process"

## VIDEO STRUCTURE

### **COLD OPEN (0:00 - 1:30)**
*Hook the viewer immediately with the transformation*

**Footage:** Kelsey testimonial clip (Feb 9, 2026)
> "The inbound stuff is working amazing, bro. I'm starting to trust it. When I take a call, by the time I get off the phone, within seconds, it's like 'you have an opportunity, a new request' and Alyssa gets it."

**Note:** Use a DIFFERENT take of this quote than Video 1 if multiple takes exist. Or use a different powerful quote from the same interview.

**Text Overlay:**
- $5K Investment → $73K Annual Value
- 1,378% ROI
- 30-Day Implementation

**Narrator/Mekaiel VO:** "This is the story of how we transformed a one-man printer repair operation into a scalable business. Here's our exact process."

---

### **ACT 1: THE PROBLEM (1:30 - 8:00)**
*Establish the pain - make viewers feel it*

#### Section 1A: Meet the Client (1:30 - 3:30)
**Footage:** Discovery meeting clips (Dec 3, 2025)

**Key Points to Cover:**
- Plotter Mechanix: $600-750K/year printer service company in Phoenix
- Kelsey = owner AND only technician (massive bottleneck)
- 3-person team: Kelsey, Alyssa (office manager), Joe (trainee)
- 70+ hours/week workload

**Kelsey Quote to Find:**
> "I struggle with managing multiple communication channels... personal cell, Vonage, Jobber, various email addresses"

**B-Roll Ideas:**
- Service van footage
- Printer repair work
- Phoenix area driving shots
- Jobber interface (blurred if needed)

#### Section 1B: The Communication Chaos (3:30 - 5:30)
**Footage:** Discovery meeting Part 2 (Dec 17, 2025)

**Visualize the Problem:**
| Channel | Purpose | Problem |
|---------|---------|---------|
| Personal cell | Customer calls | No tracking |
| Vonage | Business line | Disconnected from Jobber |
| 5+ email accounts | Suppliers, customers | Alyssa checks 10 inboxes |
| Jobber | Job management | Manual data entry |
| Paper notes | Service records | Information loss |

**Key Stat:** Alyssa spends 50% of her time (20-25 hrs/week) on email management alone

**Pain Point Quotes to Pull:**
- Kelsey on fragmented communication
- Alyssa on email overwhelm (from Feb 6 interview if available)

#### Section 1C: The Real Cost (5:30 - 8:00)
**Footage:** Internal team meetings, whiteboard sessions

**Show the Math:**
- Kelsey's rate: $75/hour
- Time wasted on manual processes: 35+ hours/week
- Annual waste: $180,000+ in lost productivity
- Phone interruptions during service: 12.5 hrs/week = $48,750/year

**The Breaking Point:**
- Can't scale without cloning Kelsey
- Turned down Lucid Motors contract (200 cuts/day) - couldn't handle volume
- Previous $7K automation investment = total failure (1% of revenue, no results)

**Transition Line:** "They'd been burned before. But we don't build solutions without understanding the problem first."

---

### **ACT 2: THE ARISEGROUP PROCESS (8:00 - 16:00)**
*This is your methodology showcase - the meat of the video*

#### Section 2A: Discovery Phase (8:00 - 11:00)
**Footage:** Discovery meetings, stakeholder interviews

**AriseGroup's Approach:**
1. **Multiple Stakeholder Interviews**
   - Kelsey (owner) - operations reality
   - Alyssa (office manager) - admin workflows
   - Joe (technician) - field perspective

2. **Baseline Metrics Collection**
   - Hours spent on each process
   - Dollar cost of inefficiencies
   - Current workflow mapping

3. **ROI-First Analysis**
   - Find highest impact opportunity BEFORE building
   - Validate with real numbers

**Show Internal Meeting Footage:**
- Team discussing findings
- Whiteboarding the workflow
- Identifying the "quick win"

**Key Insight Moment:**
> "We don't build blindly. We understand their workflow first, get real data, then build the RIGHT thing - not just A thing."

#### Section 2B: The Diagnosis (11:00 - 13:00)
**Footage:** Sales meetings, proposal presentations

**What We Found:**
| Problem | Impact | Priority |
|---------|--------|----------|
| No single source of truth | Information loss on every call | #1 |
| Manual call→Jobber handoff | 10-15 min per call | #1 |
| Phone interruptions | 12.5 hrs/week lost | #2 |
| Training bottleneck | 200 hrs per new tech | #3 |

**The Opportunity Matrix:**
- Show the actual opportunity matrix visual if available
- Or recreate with graphics

**The Proposal:**
- Phase 1: Communication Control System
- Investment: $5,000
- Timeline: 30 days
- Promise: Transform Jobber into trusted single source of truth

#### Section 2C: Implementation (13:00 - 16:00)
**Footage:** Internal meetings, technical discussions, progress updates

**What We Built:**

**1. Quo Phone System**
- Replaced fragmented Vonage setup
- Single business number for all calls
- Call recording and transcription

**2. AI-Powered Summaries (Sona)**
- Every call automatically transcribed
- AI extracts: caller name, equipment type, issue summary
- No more "what did they say?" moments

**3. Jobber Integration**
- Calls auto-create Requests in Jobber
- Within SECONDS of hanging up
- Alyssa gets notification immediately

**4. Error Handling & Monitoring**
- Slack alerts for any failures
- Daily digest of all activity
- Nothing falls through cracks

**System Flow Diagram:**
```
INBOUND CALL → QUO CAPTURES → AI TRANSCRIBES →
AUTO-CREATES JOBBER REQUEST → TEAM NOTIFIED (seconds)
```

**Show the Technical Work:**
- N8N workflow screenshots (anonymized)
- Webhook configurations
- Integration testing

**Implementation Timeline:**
- Week 1: Quo setup, API connections
- Week 2: AI integration, testing
- Week 3: Go-live, monitoring
- Week 4: Refinements, training

### **ACT 3: THE RESULTS (16:00 - 22:00)**
*Prove it worked with real evidence*

#### Section 3A: The Testimonial (16:00 - 19:00)
**Footage:** Kelsey ROI interview (Feb 9, 2026) - THIS IS YOUR MONEY SHOT

**Note:** Use DIFFERENT clips than Video 1. Find additional powerful quotes from the same interview.

**Key Kelsey Quotes (choose clips not used in Video 1):**
> "The inbound stuff is working amazing, bro. I'm starting to trust it."

> "When I take a call, by the time I get off the phone, within seconds, it's like 'you have an opportunity, a new request' and Alyssa gets it."

> "I'm gonna be your commercial, dude."

**What Changed:**
- Screenshot handoffs: ELIMINATED
- Phone call handoffs: Reduced from 4-6/day to 1-2/day
- Trust in Jobber: "I'm starting to trust it" (major shift)

**Team Adoption:**
- Alyssa processing from Request queue (not verbal handoffs)
- Joe getting context without calling Kelsey
- System working even when Kelsey is on service calls

#### Section 3B: The Numbers (19:00 - 21:00)
**Footage:** Internal review meetings, screen recordings of dashboards

**ROI Breakdown:**
| Metric | Before | After |
|--------|--------|-------|
| Communication capture | ~50% | 95%+ |
| Manual handoffs/day | 4-6 | 1-2 |
| Info loss per call | Frequent | Near zero |
| Trust in Jobber | Low | "Starting to trust it" |

**Financial Impact:**
- **Phase 1 Investment:** $5,000
- **Annual Value Created:** $73,000+
  - Kelsey time recovered: $48,750/year
  - Alyssa efficiency: $15,600/year
  - Error reduction: ~$8,650/year
- **Payback Period:** 2.5 weeks
- **First-Year ROI:** 1,378%

**Visual:** Animated ROI calculator or infographic

#### Section 3C: Issues We Found (Transparency) (21:00 - 22:00)
*Show you're honest about challenges*

**What Still Needs Work:**
- Default phone sometimes reverts to FaceTime after restart
- Follow-up calls merge into same opportunity (multi-job detection needed)
- 15,000 contacts need cleanup
- OAuth token refresh for long-term stability

**Why This Matters:**

> "I love helping people. That's why I fix printers."

#### Section 4C: What's Next - Phase 2 (26:00 - 28:00)
