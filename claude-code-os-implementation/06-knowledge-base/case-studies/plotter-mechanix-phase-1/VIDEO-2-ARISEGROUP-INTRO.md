## Section-by-Section Breakdown

### HOOK (0:00-0:15) - Problem Statement

**Visual:** Text animation or VO over B-roll of chaotic business footage

**Script (Voiceover or Text):**
> "Most AI projects fail. Not because the tech doesn't work—because the foundation wasn't ready."

**Visual Treatment:**
- Dark, serious tone
- Fragmented visuals (papers, phones, chaos)
- Text reveals word by word for emphasis

---

### WHO WE ARE (0:15-0:45) - Partner Introductions

**Script:**
> "We're AriseGroup. Four operators who became technologists."

**Partner Intro Sequence:**

| Partner | Role | Self-Intro Script | Visual |
|---------|------|-------------------|--------|
| Chris Andrade | Relationships & Lead Generation | "I'm Chris. I build relationships and open doors." | Headshot or video clip |
| Trent Christopher | Technical Architecture & SOPs | "I'm Trent. I architect the technical systems." | Headshot or video clip |
| Matthew Kerns | Production Engineering | "I'm Matthew. I make sure what we build actually works." | Headshot or video clip |
| Mekaiel Abdullahi | Product Management & Operations | "I'm Mekaiel. I translate business needs into builds." | Headshot or video clip |

**Graphics - Partner Intro Cards:**

│  CHRIS ANDRADE                         │
│  Relationships & Lead Generation       │
└────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Visual Style:**
- Each partner: 5-7 seconds
- Clean background (home office or branded backdrop)
- Name + specialty appears as lower third
- Transition: Smooth cross-dissolve between partners

---

### WHAT WE DO (0:45-1:15) - Methodology Overview

**Visual Treatment:**
- Icons animate in for each phase
- Arrows draw between phases
- Tagline builds one line at a time
- Colors: Use brand teal/amber for highlights

### HOW WE'RE DIFFERENT (1:15-1:45) - Unique Approach

**Script (VO):**
> "We don't build blindly. We understand your workflow first."
> "We stay with you long-term through retainers."
> "We're honest about what AI can and can't do."

**Visual Treatment:**
Three key differentiators with icons:

| Differentiator | Icon Idea | Text |
|----------------|-----------|------|
| Understanding First | Magnifying glass / workflow diagram | "We understand before we build" |
| Long-term Partnership | Handshake / ongoing arrows | "We stay with you" |
| Honest Approach | Checkmark / balance scale | "We're honest about AI" |

**Animation:**
- Each point appears with supporting visual
- Quick cuts between concepts
- Professional but not overly corporate
