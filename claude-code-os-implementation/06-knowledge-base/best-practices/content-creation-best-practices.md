## Hook Creation

**The 7 Hook Types**:
1. Data Hook: "87% of companies say they're adopting AI. 3% are doing it systematically."
2. Timeline Hook: "Week 1: Built. Week 2: Tested. Week 3: Deploying."
3. Contrarian Hook: "Most AI adoption fails. Here's why:"
4. Personal Story: "Spent 30 minutes planning. Now it takes 60 seconds."
5. Bold Declaration: "You don't need more AI tools. You need an AI system."
6. Question Hook: "What's worse than not using AI? Using it without a system."
7. Pattern Hook: "Built 3 agents this week. Each one faster than the last."

**Hook Quality**: Score 7+ on clarity, curiosity, relevance

## Post Structure

1. **Hook** (1-2 lines): Stop the scroll
2. **Context** (2-3 lines): Why this matters
3. **Body** (bullets/arrows): The content
4. **Key Insight** (1-2 lines): The takeaway
5. **CTA** (clear action): What to do next

**Format**: Line breaks every 1-2 sentences, CAPS for headers, → for lists
