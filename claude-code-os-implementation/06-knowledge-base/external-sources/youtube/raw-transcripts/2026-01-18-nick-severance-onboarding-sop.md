hey Nick here and in this video I'm going to show you how to nail onboarding for an automation client let's get into it so first things first this is just my

0:06
personal process it's not the only way to do onboarding for automation but it's what I did and what I managed to scale

0:12
to a little over $70,000 a month doing uh take what makes sense to you out of this video and then just throw away

0:18
whatever is not relevant um and the last thing is there's no gatekeeping I'm actually going to build some of these onboarding automations in front of you

0:24
I'm going to show you everything that I've done and I'm going to give you just all of my my thoughts behind it so this is going to be a pretty chunky long

0:30
video but I anticipate that it'll be a lot of value for a lot of people here that are looking to start their automation career okay so first things

0:36
first the three big problems that onboarding solves there are more than

0:42
just three problems that onboarding solves but here are the three big ones and here is how I want you to think about onboarding essentially onboarding

0:48
is a tool that lets you solve the main problem of buyer remorse it lets you solve another main problem of client

0:54
expectations and it also allows you to essentially like frontload a lot of the BS and inoculate yourself against

1:01
problems with Logistics later on what do I mean by Logistics I mean stuff like um not having credentials to a software

1:07
platform I mean stuff like you know not fully outlining the timeline where

1:13
you're going to be delivering stuff and then the client ends up like calling you rushed two weeks later being like Hey where's the project I needed it by today

1:19
essentially this is another form of Leverage if you just spend a few minutes upfront dealing with this problem now

1:25
you will save dozens if not hundreds of hours and hundreds of thousands of dollars over the course of the next

1:30
couple years of your career so it just makes sense to figure this out like ASAP essentially what I'm going to do

1:36
here is I'm going to discuss every problem in detail just that you guys understand the problem space um so that you understand sort of like my own

1:42
mindset here when I came up with these solutions to these problems and then I'm actually going to show you how to solve every one of these problems um as I

1:48
mentioned including building a few simple systems I'm also going to provide you some templates I have a few little assets and documents here as well as

1:55
just a couple of step-by-step checklists that I personally used quite heavily when I was first starting out obvious the better that you get on the stuff the

2:01
less you need these Assets in front of you while you're selling while you're closing or while you're building stuff but they tend to really decrease the

2:08
learning curve or I guess your ability to get out there close your first couple of clients and and get up and running so

2:13
highly encourage you guys make use of them all right so problem number one that home buring solves is buyer remorse

2:19
now if you're unfamiliar with just sales in general um or you know the concept of buyers or Mor here's basically how it

2:25
works somebody just sent you a bit of money no matter how good the process that you use to sell them is the fact

2:33
that the money is no longer in their wallet or I guess their bank account nowadays will create buyers remorse

2:40
there's going to be some sort of remorse some sort of Doubt at the back of their mind essentially like did I make the

2:45
right decision partnering with the service provider instead of you know other service providers or instead of doing it myself or instead of finding

2:51
some other solution so if you think about onboarding from sort of like a sales perspective um it's an additional

2:57
tool that you get to use to to streamline uh the next steps immediately after the sale and your goal running an

3:03
automation agency is to minimize buyers remorse as soon as humanly possible good onboarding helps you do this great

3:09
onboarding helps you turn this buyer remorse into like buyer gratitude essentially for being super uh super

3:15
stoked to start with you and when you have projects that are like that when people are extremely extraordinarily excited to get started with you uh and

3:21
you also have like very strong and clear expectations put out uh those clients tend to be the ones that retain for a

3:27
very long time where you start getting to take advantage of the multip of this business right like your first project with a client it's a small one and

3:33
you're selling Automation Services might be like 1 2 3K let's say if you um nail

3:38
onboarding and nail everything that I'm going to show you in this guide uh you essentially have the opportunity to turn that 2 or 3K client into like a 5k a

3:46
month client for the next year and that's 20 times more money if you think about it that way then you'd be able to get immediately so very very big point

3:52
of Leverage and something that you know I I I wish more people would think about in advance the second big problem is

3:58
client expectations and this is like one of the biggest issues just in all service businesses not necessarily automation one thing

4:05
I'll mention here is automation is particularly terrible for it because of the presence of scope creep like um if

4:11
you think about it right I used to run a Content writing company called one second copy and what's really involved

4:16
in content writing well there's like two or maybe three subservices here there's the writing there's the editing U maybe

4:22
there's like the outlining right very simple and easy sort of business model um comparatively whereas with automation

4:29
if you think about that that way there are like 5 million subservices there's obviously like the scoping there's like the process flow charting there's like

4:35
the make.com scenario building there's like API Integrations there's like your ability to like drag and drop modules

4:40
and know how that specific platform works but also understand programming principles to be able to like put something together you have to know like

4:46
I don't know let's say you're working with a pipe drive you have to understand pipe drive you have to understand padoc you have to understand all this and

4:53
honestly when you have all of this stuff going on um client expectations uh and

4:58
their scope can can blow up and that tends to happen pretty often especially if you don't really know what you're doing so if you're just getting start

5:04
with automation maybe you've got like your first couple of clients you you'll probably understand what I mean by this intuitively but having a good onboarding

5:10
process can inoculate yourself against a lot of that stuff it's sort of like a vaccine or something against you know

5:15
some some virus if you just like deal with it right now you eliminate that from ever being an issue you eliminate

5:21
all of the time energy and money that you waste um later on dealing with it here's the fundamental Paradox of client

5:27
expectations in order to grow your business business you have to win clients in order to win clients the

5:34
simplest and easiest way to do so is to increase your expectations so sorry increase the client expectations what I

5:41
mean by that is sort of the whole process of selling is incentivizing you

5:46
to blow up this project and make it look even better than it probably really is in reality right that's just how sales

5:52
works but in order to grow your business you also have to deliver projects and if you think about the way that delivering

5:58
projects um Works through incentives it all involves reducing expectations

6:03
turning a complicated project into as simple a project as humanly possible and so essentially what you have here is you

6:10
have two like incentives that are butting each other right in the head um the first is sort of the sale incentive

6:15
which is sell them the dream sell them this you know super big complex comprehensive project we can get as much

6:21
money as humanly possible out of them and then the second is sell them something small something packet

6:26
something manageable that I can do in you know a weekend the issue here is that most people will

6:31
always do the former a little too well because they want to get the deal which is totally understandable and I've done this a million in one times myself and

6:38
what that means is when it comes time to deliver the project they are screwed right because now it's like oh okay um

6:44
sure we might have made an additional $110,000 or something like that but the cost of that additional $10,000 is now

6:50
our delivery team has to spend another three weeks creating all these additional systems right it's a paint

6:55
yes excuse me what oper what onboarding does is it provides you the opportunity

7:00
to frame those expectations ASAP and upfront and by doing this it lets you inoculate yourself against dozens of

7:07
common gotches and by gotches I mean just like things that most service providers deal with like uh

7:12
Communications being an issue timeline being an issue your working style being an issue not knowing what the wind

7:17
condition of your project is like when do you actually know when your project is done you got to talk about this with the client otherwise what are you going

7:23
to do do all the work and then deliver the project and the client's going to be like well it's not really done right why not just do it immediately and save

7:29
yourself that stress basically what your goal is um with client expectations is to give the

7:34
client all the info that they need up front so they never have to bug you later and so that they'll be satisfied when you deliver what you said that you

7:39
were going to deliver uh which sounds pretty easy um you know theoretically but in practice it can be a lot more

7:45
difficult and I'll show you how to solve all that now the last part here is very specific to automation uh and it's sort

7:52
of like Logistics this is what I call automation is a lot of moving Parts by Nature at its core what automation is is

7:58
it's like juggling 5,000 different platforms and gluing them all together with an automation platform like

8:03
make.com or something like that and you know when you're juggling all these different platforms you can imagine how

8:10
uh in order to like logistically manage the work you need to gain access to all

8:15
of them you need to deal with two-factor authentication concerns you need to deal with the right subscription plans you

8:21
need to have good credentials your customer needs to know the credentials you need to go the credentials you need to deal with sub accounts and all that

8:27
stuff this is sort of like the the the nitty-gritty dirty part of doing automations and if you don't have all of

8:34
this up front and I meant to write you uh you end up having like a much more difficult time later because then you have to drip this stuff out over time

8:40
every time you ask a client for some information it'll take them some time to get back to you sort of like this cat and mouse stuff that a lot of beginners

8:46
unfortunately fall prey to especially with tofa stuff because you need to like be in the same time zone as your client or whatever at like the same time and

8:52
they need to be available and all that and it ends up just like really hurting your professionalism and not only does it hurt your professionalism

8:58
it very negatively impacts your ability to deliver on the schedule that you said that you were going to do so your goal

9:04
in solving this problem is to minimize friction and get access to everything ASAP you should not need to ask the

9:10
client for any sort of credentials accounts two Factor auth authentication codes change the subscription plan none

9:16
of that stuff um after the first day basically just because it really really hurts your ability to get that client

9:22
again in the future and if you solve all this upfront the client will think that you're super prepared you're super professional and that like you know you

9:28
know your your business really well uh which will obviously allow you to retain them super easily later on all right so how do you actually

9:35
solve these three problems well each of these three problems um I solved in three ways so the first buyers remorse I

9:41
solve byas by basically front loading the dopamine and front loading um notifications front loading gratitude

9:47
and basically just filling up their email inbox as quickly as possible after they make the payment um so that they think that essentially the perception of

9:53
process sorry perception of progress and I'll show you how to do each of these three in a moment and I'll build out systems for them as

10:00
well the second to to manage client expectations um there are three solutions here the first is that you

10:05
need to Define your communication style as well as the frequency with which you will be communicating UPF front the second is you need to set a timeline

10:11
which is basically how long every step will take and what sort of deliverable you have at every step and the third is you need to define the wind condition

10:17
the wind condition you know sounds super fancy but it's basically just like hey how are we going to know when our project is done right like if I'm

10:23
delivering you a lead generation system how do I actually know that that lead generation system is finished and I can like take a step back

10:29
um when do we start on my retainer for instance like like what's the next step after the project is done the problem number three which is

10:36
the logistics and the moving parts and all that stuff you solve them in three ways the first is you itemize all the platforms and you basically provide them

10:42
a list that they can use in order to sign up to them for you uh the second is that you have an onboarding call that

10:48
just front loads all of the that you otherwise would have to drip out over time and you know tons of people have tried to do the the

10:54
logistics step uh through forms and whatnot they're like oh well I got to automate this because I'm an automation engineer but you really shouldn't this

11:00
is like the highest leverage point of you being in front of your client and then um you can use secure credential

11:05
management essentially to to solve the problem of password sharing and and all that fun stuff so yeah we're going to go

11:11
into detail and build all of them uh right now so first and formost let's talk a little bit about um the first

11:17
solution here which is transactional alerts this is going to sound really simple and really basic for a lot of people but if you pay somebody and you

11:24
pay somebody a fair amount of money let's say $4,000 or something like that and you don't receive like a receipt of

11:29
that purchase um basically immediately you're going to have a very very bad taste in your mouth and that buyer's

11:34
remorse is going to sort of snowball into uh like who the hell am I working with here is this person professional

11:39
like like what's going on basically there needs to be some type of transactional alert or notification

11:45
immediately after the person pays you all this money and they just need to have like a receipt for it so um this

11:51
depends on your payment processor a lot of payment processors do this automatically thankfully in stripe uh which is the payment processor that I

11:56
personally use and that I recommend for a lot of people uh you need to specifically go into customer emails enable receipts um and then you know

12:03
have those receipts sent basically immediately after the the purchase is done so what you would do um here if you

12:08
doing this for yourself is you'd have to open up the stripe homepage and then go to settings up here in the top right and

12:14
then go to business and then you'd have to go more uh customer emails I believe

12:19
and then under payments you'll have to go successful payments and turn that on and essentially what this is going to do

12:25
is uh every time that somebody sends you or sorry every time you send somebody money

12:30
you're going to get something that looks a little bit like this right over here um so every time sorry you send somebody

12:36
money you get a receipt um and obviously make sure that the experience that they have when they get a receipt from you is

12:41
as high brow as possible make sure that you've done all like the strip BS of like adding your logo and making it look all pretty having your brand colors

12:47
whatever your payment processor is obviously this will differ uh but I personally always recommend um anybody in my community or anybody watching my

12:53
videos just to like use strip it's super simple it's very well supported and it's super integratable which is an automation specialist makes a lot ofense

12:59
sense so you're going to want something like this um basically to happen within 30 seconds of somebody working with you

13:05
or choosing to work with you or paying you money and this is just sort of like a quick little hit it's like yeah you did make that payment um and you know

13:11
all of the logistical stuff is like taken care of on our end don't worry your receipts here uh we're we're professional about it I know it sounds

13:17
super simple but you'd be surprised at how many people don't do this all right the next thing I want to talk about is gratitude what do I mean by gratitude

13:24
well I mean expressing sincere gratitude to your client cents for choosing to

13:31
spend time energy and money with you I know this sounds simple again but turns

13:36
out that most things in the agency space are very simple you can go very far simply by remembering to thank your

13:42
client for doing things for you what do I mean by this uh every time a client sends me a message I uh I thank them for

13:49
reaching out every time they follow up with me after I haven't heard from them for a while I thank them for doing so

13:54
every time I jump on a call with them I thank them every time I get a payment from them I thank them this makes you look extremely professional but not only

14:01
that I've worked with enough clients at this point in my life to definitively be able to say that the situations in which

14:06
I've consistently Express gratitude for being able to work with somebody um tend to yield me substantially higher rois

14:13
like our relationships go way way further and I'm still not 100% sure if it's just the professionalism or if it's

14:19
just the fact that you know I I'm just like I'm I'm acting like a human being when I do it and people tend to pick up on that and they think that I'm a lot

14:25
more genuine but it works now the great news about gratitude is if you are truly

14:30
gracious so you can build a very simple system that just watches events or uses a web hook and when you receive a new

14:36
payment transaction notification uh you can just send an email uh that's like you know like a one sort of I don't know

14:43
three or four line email which I'll show you in a second uh that just thanks them and you can do it within about five or five or so minutes of receiving the

14:49
payment and by doing it this way um it tends to be it tends to seem a lot more like handwritten and customized and that

14:55
sort of deal uh which obviously C customers or clients tend to like a lot more more and that tends to seem just a

15:00
lot uh you know a lot more genuine so again the goal is basically and I do this in separate email but the goal is

15:07
we want to provide people the perception of like customized highquality care and I actually send them a bespoke email

15:14
with a thank you on it in addition to the receipt and here's what my personal one usually looks like I mean you know

15:19
it's evolved over time and I used to do all the stuff manually but um you know now I now I automate the vast majority

15:25
of it it's just high neck thanks for taking care of that invoice so promptly I'm beyond happy that we get the chance to work together and excited to nail this for you I'll send you some

15:31
onboarding instructions plus a calendar in a moment and we can then book a call to kick off our project looking forward

15:36
to chatting and I appreciate your business so that's it doesn't have to be super magical you're literally texting

15:42
or you're sending somebody an email as if you would text them thanking them for doing something for you and on a more

15:47
General note I find that that's just the best way to proceed with all client Communications just proceed with them like you're texting a friend of yours

15:53
because um clients tend to pick up on that and treat that as substantially more genuine than what a lot of other people do which is they write these big

15:59
fancy long email sequences that just seem like uh just seem like you are treating them like another Cog in in in

16:06
your machine if that makes sense but yeah so my goal is I want them to get a bunch of emails simultaneously to

16:11
minimize buyer remorse to just make it feel like shit's happening like they just gave me their money I want to give them something too and the number one

16:17
thing that you can give a client is just the impression of of progress and things are moving in the direction that they want them to and then the last thing is

16:25
indeed that perception of progress and what do I mean by this I really just mean like next steps um now that they paid it's essential that you provide the

16:31
perception that you are getting their project started like immediately like within 5 minutes of them getting paid if

16:37
you do this the clients that you provide the impression of progress within five minutes are going to go much much

16:42
farther for you than the clients that you don't do this for I don't know like several hours or days as mentioned

16:48
previously tons of situations where I've hired a service provider and I haven't heard back from them for like 48 Hours

16:53
frankly if I'm being honest I think that sort of thing is unacceptable especially given that like basically everybody on planet Earth has hired a service

16:59
provider for something at some point and so they at least understand how it feels from the other point of view the fact that you know a lot of these business

17:05
owners can't put that together I think it's the primary reason why you can crush it in this industry so easily so

17:12
yeah um again we can build a very simple system and we can have the system just watch events or use a web hook and then send an email from you I'll do that

17:18
right now in a second um and then I would encourage it you do this within five minutes at this point they've received three or four emails in a very

17:24
short period of time and which makes them feel really good it also makes them feel like you're on top of things you have a very defined streamline process

17:31
for this and they've done this multiple times before which eliminates a lot of like the perceived risk of working with service providers and is basically the

17:37
most straight line way of maximizing the uh the customer experience but okay how do you actually build this out super

17:42
simple and super easy um I personally do this in make.com an automation tool that uh I'm quite uh I mean I popularize a

17:49
little bit but I'm definitely famous for like the make.com stuff not the zapier stuff or the na10 stuff if you are using

17:54
another automation tool it's very simple just follow along sort of the process logic that I'm doing here we're going to pretend that there is some event that is

18:02
occurring U maybe some type of booking and then uh what do we do when we uh receive that booking well if you

18:08
have a CRM or something like that you're going to have to pull data from the CRM what I'm going to do is I'm just going to set a bunch of

18:14
variables and I'm basically going to pretend that I'm pulling them from my CRM so one will be like name we'll just

18:19
say Nick we'll say email address we'll say

18:25
my email address right over here Nick a left click. and then we just use the mail module here to send an

18:34
email you will create a connection up at the top right hand corner uh in make.com and you'll use that to sort of um this

18:40
will be your from email and then the to email I'm just going to map this as the email address the subject line I'm just

18:46
going to use thank you and welcome aboard and I'm going to do it in HTML but you don't necessarily have to you

18:52
could do this in a plain text if you wanted to the way that you do it in HTML is

18:57
HTML uses um some tags uh specifically this one tag called BR and so basically

19:03
every time you do a br it's a new line so I'm doing two BRS between every um piece of text here so that there's two

19:08
new lines between them and then between this one I'll do one so when you know somebody receives

19:15
this email well we can actually test this right now when I run this module and then I

19:21
type in the email address and I think this is going to work I mean I am sing this to myself so maybe there'll be an

19:26
issue of some kind oh sorry I need to reauthorize my connection just give me one

19:32
second we'll just add a new one call it Google and we'll go Nick at left click. a we'll go July 19th 2024 this is what

19:39
you have to do if you've never set it up before it'll um open another window that allows you to select your Gmail

19:47
account and once you connect to the two it'll verify once it's verified this

19:53
little button will go purple then you can go ahead and send it and I think you can send it to yourself not entirely

19:59
sure yeah you can okay great um and you know at this point I've just automated this this email um the benefit here is

20:05
you know the way that I've written this copies just seems very incidental and it seems very like hey how's it going I totally just wrote this myself which is

20:11
great um you can imagine how you could do the exact same thing for our other piece of

20:16
copy and uh what else you could do is you could add a little bit of a sleep

20:23
module and you can say that I don't I want to delay let's say 200 and 40

20:29
seconds so I want to delay 4 minutes basically and this is going to be wait four minutes I'm going to call this grab

20:36
data from CRM right if you're using clickup or Monday or pipe drive or whatever you would just use like the retrieve record uh module here and then

20:44
what we want to do is we need to use a router uh because we just want to send this to two

20:50
places so this is going to be route number one and this is going to be route number two this is going to be send

20:55
thank you email and then this one's going to be send onboarding

21:02
email and then all I'm going to do is I'll go over to next steps and then I'm just going to change um the email copy

21:09
so that instead of what I had before now I have this and because I'm going to be doing two BRS in a row I'm just going to

21:16
copy paste copy paste copy paste copy paste and then uh because it's HTML

21:23
if you want to embed a link you need to use this format this a tag with an ending a tag

21:29
and this needs to go to where you want it to go I'm just going to pretend this going to this calendar right over here which is my like Discovery sales call

21:34
calendar um and the last thing is I'm just going to write an email here call it next

21:40
steps um make sure that you know the connection is correct and everything this looks good to me let me just make

21:46
this a little sexier and then what I'm also going to do is I'm going to add one more sleep here so that when I do ultimately send

21:54
the email um there's some like offset between the first one up here and then the second one over here make will run

21:59
these um one after another so it'll start up here and then it'll go down here afterwards so let's say it'll take me another 3 minutes or so to to write

22:06
the email or something hypothetically and now what'll happen is um we'll grab the data from the CRM when the new event

22:11
comes in we'll wait four minutes we'll then send the first email and then we'll go into the second route wait another uh

22:16
what's this three minutes and send the second email now just for testing purposes I'm just going to turn the

22:21
delay here to one because I don't actually want to wait that long and then uh I'm going to pretend that there's no

22:27
event here and I'm just initiating the flow from this but we'll just call this onboarding

22:33
emails I'm just going to give this thing a little run we're going to send that first email going to wait three minutes

22:38
send the other email if we go back you'll see that essentially we've replicated the same event or the same

22:44
idea that we had previously where uh they'll get a receipt um you know with a stripe transaction and then they'll get

22:49
a thank you and welcome aboard and they'll get a next steps email uh which is very very simple as you can see this

22:55
is really one of those automations that I should you not it takes you like less than 5 minutes to set up and then it's one of those automations that if you

23:01
spend that five minutes to set it up this will make you thousands of dollars tens of thousands of dollars over the

23:06
course of the next 12 months simply for having the foresight to put that infrastructure in place obviously you're

23:11
going to have to connect the beginning part here with this web hook to your payment processor so that's something that I'm leaving out because I don't know what payment processor you're using

23:18
if you're using um stripe here you would go to the stripe

23:23
module go to the watch events module and then you have to configure it to watch payment intent events essentially what

23:28
ever the payment uh is that you're that you're getting if you're using something like I don't know QuickBooks

23:34
hypothetically um you could watch a new event you know anytime an invoice is sent or received you could you know have

23:40
that run a variety of different ways to do it but what I'm going to do is I'm going to export this blueprint and I'm

23:45
just going to um use this in my materials as sort of like a sort of like sales materials um sorry sort of like as

23:53
a as a lead magnet and then I'm going to put this inside of the YouTube video so that you guys can just you know copy and paste this if you need

24:00
to all right so that's for that's it for gratitude and perception of progress um at this point as I mentioned they've

24:06
received through for emails very quickly and it's just super straightforward and easy for them to get started um which is

24:11
nice the second major problem as I mentioned before is client expectations now client expectations unfortunately in

24:17
the automation world are very very difficult to get right and and I mean if you haven't done a lot of projects before you will basically always screw

24:23
this up the simplest way to make some serious progress you know on this

24:28
problem is just to spend like 2 minutes thinking about how much you want to communicate and how you want to be

24:35
communicated with in a client relationship most agencies and service providers will never even spend like two

24:41
minutes just thinking about this and it's why you know they're very um they they they tend to struggle with scaling

24:46
their businesses and doing good things but as I mentioned here it's the simplest lever you could pull to eliminate 90% plus of problems all

24:53
you're doing is you're telling the client hey this is how often I'm going to communicate with you this is where I'm going to communicate with you

24:59
for instance hey I'll be available 12: until 2 p 2m PT on slack every day if you have any questions and you're going

25:05
to get progress updates on Tuesdays and Fridays EOD hey I'm going to send you an email at the end of the day every day Monday to Friday just going to summarize

25:11
where we're at if I have any blockers if I need your help on something or whatever we'll deal with it then and the goal here is just to ensure we

25:17
consistently make progress towards your delivery there are dozens of more uh dozens more examples that you could pick

25:22
from I'm just choosing a couple of random ones uh that you can use as inspiration whether you're slack whether

25:28
they prefer email how some of them might even prefer a call uh and it's really up to you to determine whether or not that's something that you're willing to

25:35
do so I acknowledge here that there is an optimal communication style and probably an optimal communication

25:41
frequency um but you can probably deliver more than 90% of the results here by literally just telling them how

25:46
often you're going to communicate with them and then just sticking with it so maybe you communicate with them once a month or something I don't know if you

25:52
just tell them you're going to communicate them once a month and then you give them that expectation and then you hold to your expectation um you're

25:58
going to do much better than somebody that communicates with somebody 30 times a month but they never really tell them when and why they're doing it my own

26:05
personal sop for this um in the past I did once per week and I thought once per week was good because it would you know

26:10
allow me to be very autonomous and I wouldn't have to communicate with them often and I don't really like jumping on all these silly calls just to give

26:15
progress updates and that sort of deal but I did occasionally run into a few issues and the specific issues where

26:21
clients felt like I wasn't keeping them in the loop they tended to wonder when things were going to be delivered um even though I told them before and

26:28
essentially they just sort of forgot about me and uh it led to a couple of client blowups from every now and then

26:35
it was nothing major but you know if we're trying to be as efficient as performant as possible obviously that's something that I could have changed

26:40
right so now what I'm doing is two times per week and I give them a defined slack availability where they can expect me to

26:46
respond to them within 10 or 15 minutes um and that tends to be you know about an hour or two hour slot what I do is I

26:51
just batch all of my clients for that hour or two hour slot and then I just know okay like I got to be by the computer for you know 2 hours 12: to 2

26:57
p.m. PT for instance in practice clients will rarely ask me questions um and usually what I do is I

27:02
just work on other during that time anyway and I'm just like buy my computer so that adds a ton of value this Define

27:07
slack availability although obviously you know you have to make sure that your client is the type of client that wants to work on slack a lot of clients don't

27:12
like slack a lot of clients use teams instead or they use email or whatever so just make sure whatever your offer is is sustainable essentially okay problem

27:20
number two um that you can easily eliminate is kind of the stress at how

27:25
the project is proceeding and when the project will be completed and the simplest and easiest way to do this is to spend another 2 minutes up

27:31
front just setting the timeline as most of us probably unfortunately know the vast majority of

27:37
projects that any service provider will ever do for any client uh will be behind schedule their project timelines are

27:43
almost always optimistic and as a result uh there's always some things that they didn't really account for that uh crop

27:49
up during the project they end up being late for simpler automation projects especially some of the ones like what I

27:55
was just showing you back here I mean this is like what not even 10 mod mod here it took me 5 minutes um it's

28:01
absolutely ridiculous that you would be behind schedule for something like that like that is something that you should be able to do in a few minutes you

28:08
probably shouldn't do it in a few minutes because you do want the client to feel as if there was some work that goes into it of course we need some social you know we need some Nuance here

28:15
U but it's not something that you know you should set a timeline for three weeks for and then deliver in five right

28:20
you can realistically do most of the work that you're going to be demanded in a few hours if you're smart about it and if you work with software platforms that

28:26
you know and if you take advantage of templates like I've talk talked about in previous videos so one of the simplest ways to retain your automation clients

28:32
and to basically multiply your revenue is to set a reasonably generous schedule not super generous but reasonably

28:37
generous and then just exceed the Expectations by delivering ahead of it so for instance if you wanted to set up

28:42
some big email system let's say we had like 10 of these scenarios or something hypothetically uh 10times 5 minutes

28:47
takes me about an hour to do I'd probably set like a three to five day turnaround time for that and then I deliver it by like the second day or

28:53
something and I'd say hey how's it going you know had a lot of additional time I wanted to make sure that we could deal that I could handle this and give it to

28:59
you ahead of schedule to see if there's any more work that you needed or something like that very very simple thing to do uh but you'd be surprised at

29:05
how much money that it leaves on the table when you don't do it okay another thing is this doesn't have to be

29:11
complicated I give a quick example here of some AI scenario where you're doing some prompt engineering um July 19th to

29:17
22nd I'm doing prompt engineering July 23rd to 26 I'm doing the make.com scenarios July 27 to 3D I'm doing

29:22
testing and delivery and then when you deliver your final project on July 27th as opposed to 30th the client will be really impressed right I give you a

29:29
quick example of just some little Snippets that you can write to them um in order to to drop

29:34
that the last thing that you could solve very easily with onboarding uh is the

29:40
wind condition and what I mean by wi condition is I mean the set of conditions that a client needs to see

29:48
before they consider the project completed and done so a lot of the time we'll never

29:54
just have that conversation and if you think about it it's a very logical conversation hey when am I going to be done like what sorts of boxes do I need

30:01
to check before our project is over the problem with not doing this is a lot of the time the client's internal

30:07
win conditions will be different from your win conditions and so you will deliver a project that you think is done and that you know delivers the win

30:13
condition and they'll be like huh I wonder why I didn't deliver X Y and Z hey man when are you going to do x y and z now you're doing more work than you

30:19
were initially banking on the client is unhappy and this is just a sort of way that you know um um projects lead to

30:24
unfortunately so a quick example of this is you know a lot of the guys in my community right now are starting to sell

30:30
lead generation projects because I've shown um you know I've provide an ample amount of material showing people how to sell lead generation projects and it's

30:35
quite an easy and producti offer but if you are selling a lead generation project what is what are you actually

30:42
giving to the client like what are they actually getting at the end of it they're not just getting leads right your deliverable is a lot more specific

30:49
than leads your deliverable is hypothetically on July 30th you will have a completed air table that

30:55
automatically populates with new positive responses from your smart lead campaign your campaign will operate

31:00
Monday to Friday from 7:00 to 7: using our best-in-class copyrighting formula and you'll also get slack notifications

31:06
every time a new one comes in to minimize the response time you'll get an sop sheet that you can use yourself or

31:11
to hire an Outreach manager to do the response management for you and I'm also going to give you a video walking you through the system from start to finish

31:17
okay that is a perfect example of a win condition if you check all of those boxes the project is completed if you

31:23
leave some of those boxes unchecked your end of the bargain is still not completed just have that conversation with the

31:29
client ahead of time and if you do the vast majority of the problems that most other service providers have like with

31:35
repeat revisions over and over and over again or with client scope creep going out of control they're not going to be a

31:41
problem for you and all of the other people that are in your industry are going to be looking at you being like how the hell does that guy deal with this this super unscop difficult

31:47
projects I have no idea what sort of magic witchcraft he's doing um because

31:53
you know I get a lot of people asking me that okay so that is the second problem which is client expectations right first

31:59
problem was um buyer remorse second problem is client expectations the third problem is uh the logistics and

32:05
basically how do we deal with all the 5 million moving parts that automation contains well there are three very

32:12
simple ways to do so the first is by prepping for so what I always do is I

32:17
always do an onboarding call and I realized now I probably should have had this before this but uh anyway I

32:23
normally do an onboarding call and you know that's why the person books uh an event in the calendar link that I sent

32:28
over right and on that onboarding call I will have them sign up to all the platforms that I need them to sign up for in order to do the job and make sure

32:35
that it's all done and the simplest way to streamline that onboarding call is simply to itemize all of the platforms

32:41
that they're going to need access to in advance and then build them a list of very simple instructions they can follow on that onboarding call in order to sign

32:47
up for all those platforms that they need you can send this in the above email um like if you wanted to create a PDF and like you know attach something

32:54
you could do that but either way you just need to know what they they need to know what they need to do in order to

32:59
make your onboarding call success it's sort of like the win condition of the onboarding call right a quick example of

33:04
what I mean by itemized platforms is literally just let's say they need to sign up for make.com it's super simple this might take you like 15 minutes to

33:10
put together for all platforms you just give them instructions on how to get going hey head to this thing sign up

33:16
with this for hosting region select us click register right a bcde e FG the

33:21
fact that you have all this preferred will make a very big impression on the clients and they'll tend to think that you know you've done this again tons of

33:27
times before and you know you're very on top of your it'll also just make it very easy for them and um make the onboarding call a lot less uh basically

33:33
you're going to mitigate a lot of friction on onboarding calls there's also some situations where

33:39
the client has signed up to a platform on their own using ooth or similar um meaning they'll have two-factor authentication and if you guys have

33:45
built any automation projects up until now you'll know two-factor authentication is like the bane of an automation engineer's existence it's

33:51
freaking terrible uh because you know in order to bypass it you need to the client needs to get a text message and

33:56
they need to send you the response and then you need to plug that response in within a certain amount of time if they

34:02
don't do it within a certain amount of time the code is wrong so it resends it and it's just very difficult to coordinate you know when that occurs

34:08
some platforms also require you to do this multiple times which can be massive pain in the ass and uh generally speaking you know that's really where

34:15
like a lot of the value in an onboarding call comes from because you just get to sidestep all like the logistical that typically plagues most

34:21
automation specialist the other Edge case here on onboarding calls is clients don't understand the underlying

34:27
Technologies and they struggle with things like giving you access with the username and password giving you credentials that sort of thing so um you

34:34
know having an onboarding call where you are just physically present and you screen share with them essentially uh solves so much of this because now you

34:40
can just like guide them through hey you don't remember your password for that well let's see here do you mind sharing your screen okay great why don't you

34:46
click on this button and then click on that button and then go there right or if it's two Factor authentication H okay you just got a text message all right

34:52
that makes sense yeah sure what's the code and then you just deal with it right then and there this usually takes about 15 minutes and the benefit to this

34:59
that not a lot of people talk about is it lets them feel in control of their data and their security like a lot of automation Specialists um will just sign

35:05
up to all the platforms for them that's is what I used to do uh because it just you know moved me a lot faster if I'm honest but by doing this I've noticed

35:11
the clients just tend to respect our relationship a lot more they tend to realize and understand the value that I'm providing because to a lot of them

35:17
like all this Tech stuff is super intimidating right and then it also makes them feel a little bit more secure which is nice they're not like sending

35:23
their credentials and plain text over email or something um they're doing it you know directly through um through

35:29
through like a call and I'm there to see it uh which is quite nice and you know again it's not necessarily the most

35:34
secure thing is just we're providing the impression of security which to the client is the thing that matters the most by the end of the onboarding call

35:40
you'll have everything that you need in order to finish the project and the client is also going to be really excited to kick off but the big question

35:46
is obviously Nick what the hell is the onboarding call and don't worry I put together a lovely template for you that I used I used to use in basically every

35:53
onboarding call now I don't actually really use this template anymore just because of like memorized all these steps um and I sort of have fun with it

36:00
um as needed but let me just jump over here this is what the template looks like it's very simple and very straight forward as you can tell literally just

36:07
hey thank you very much for joining so we're you know giving them some gratitude and then I just um explained

36:12
to them the schedule of the call and like what I'm going to be doing and why I'm doing it so um I'll always just say

36:17
hey so thanks so much for jumping on the call uh you know the biggest issue in this space and I work with dozens of people hundreds of people on projects at

36:23
this point is logistics um if you've ever had a project on automation you'll know that two Factor authentication is a

36:29
massive pain in the ass passwords are a massive pain in the ass all of this stuff ends up being a massive Nightmare

36:35
and can really prevent projects from moving forward so I just sidestep all that by frontloading the onboarding call and uh it's just the most effective and

36:41
simplest way I found of doing this so that makes sense everybody's like yeah of course and then you know I outline the call by giving them my road map what

36:48
are we going to do in the next 20 minutes well first we're going to cover timelines I'm going to show you or uh we're going to talk about how best to

36:53
stay in touch with each other what you can expect basically at every part of the project and that sort of deal then we're going

36:59
to sign up to all the platforms listed I've already prepared a bunch of detailed instructions which I just sent you in the chat um this will enable you

37:06
to literally just go from top to bottom sign up to all these platforms and then I'll have access before the end of the call and then if any of these platforms

37:13
require two Factor authentication I'll be able to like request a code immediately right in front of you you'll get it on your phone and you can just tell me what the code is that way I

37:19
don't need to like I don't know borrow you for 15 minutes randomly at 800m on a Tuesday right we can just streamline all

37:25
of that right now um the last thing we'll do is we'll just have a little Q&A period And if you have any questions that you've been wondering about um

37:32
before we actually start the project I can just answer them then does that make sense great all right let's get started and you just proceed from top to bottom

37:39
it's a very simple process of course and there are better onboarding procedures out there to be sure but this is one

37:44
that I've used and it's one that worked for me from there all you have to do is actually go out there and do the

37:50
freaking project which is obviously the more complicated part but the good news

37:55
is you have everything that you need in order to thrive um at this point you have every platform access piece of

38:01
credential two-factor authentication you have all that stuff taken care of the client also understands the timeline

38:06
they have Great Expectations in place for when you're going to be communicating with and you've essentially inoculated yourself against

38:11
the major issues in providing Services right on the good onboarding process uh makes for a good project and ever since

38:19
I started implementing like a consistent onboarding I found that the value of my projects and like the I guess uh reten

38:27
rate on the clients that I get especially initially because I usually do like a small onetime project to start and I do like a repeated um retainer

38:34
afterwards is like five or 10 times higher it's stupid last thing I'm going to say to

38:39
this before I jump off here is that you can do this with yourself or with a small team you don't have to do this

38:45
with like a big giant like you don't need a giant team in order to do onboarding right one uh unfortunate

38:50
thing that I've seen a couple of companies do is for whatever reason like I was actually just working at a company

38:55
that did this like two months ago they a team of uh maybe six or seven people and every time they onboard a new client

39:01
they got all of their people on the call to like say hey hello how's it going thank you very much for signing up and I kind of get the idea of this but uh it

39:07
was it was massive Overkill you don't need to do this at all as you saw earlier you can do the automations in less than five minutes and that's

39:13
including the receipts um all you have to do is you know you can use some of my copy borrow it if you want or you can

39:18
just come up with your own um all you need to do is just think for another 15 minutes about how best to Define your wi

39:24
conditions how best to set a timeline and how best to Define your coms and frequency that's something that all of us here can

39:29
uh can do within a few minutes which is quite nice and then uh you know you just follow a simple onboarding call sop do

39:34
it a couple times and you'll know like the back of your hand by the third or fourth so it's very very simple and very

39:40
straightforward and automation is the leverage here um you know this isn't something that requires really more than

39:45
just a few maybe an hour of thought Max as I mentioned a couple times throughout

39:51
the call onboarding just provides a lift to everything else your attention your relationship the ticket sizes that you can charge and that sort of thing um

39:57
and the number one thing that it's actually done for me that I did not include here is it's really improved my reputation this is a much smaller market

40:04
and a smaller world than most people think I mean technically you know if you're in automation you can work with anybody because you're just improving

40:09
their margins and you're improving their Topline and increasing the efficiency of their processes and that sort of thing but I find in practice my name gets

40:16
around quite a lot more and it has been not just because of this YouTube channel um but because of just the way that I work with clients so if you're looking

40:22
for a type of business where you know you have like very high referral rate you know for every one client you uh 10

40:28
clients you get they refer you to an average of five or something like that the best way to do it is with a very strong onboarding process um and just

40:35
setting yourself up for Success if you guys want something more Hands-On uh just check the bio I have a community

40:40
and also have a website where I'm going to be starting to uh provide resources uh at cost to people that want to shave

40:47
several hours off of the process of building like a CRM for a specific industry or doing a specific template or

40:53
getting a cold email system up and running that sort of deal otherwise I sincerely wish you the best best of luck and I hope that everything that I've

40:58
talked about in this video made sense again this is just one way that you can do it but I hope that I provided you

41:04
guys the knowledge so that it's not that I'm just like talking at you and telling you to do it this way it's that you guys

41:11
understand why this is being done that's the sort of thing that will give you guys autonomy and agency over being able to create this process for yourself and

41:17
maybe even improving on my process too if you guys have any questions feel free to drop them down below as comments

41:22
otherwise please like subscribe do all that fun YouTube stuff I'll catch youall in the next video thanks so much
