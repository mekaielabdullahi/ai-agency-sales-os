# Raw Transcripts

## How to Use

1. **Get transcript** from YouTube (use browser extension, YouTube's built-in transcript, or a tool like youtubetranscript.com)

2. **Name the file**: `YYYY-MM-DD-channel-name-video-title.md`
   - Example: `2026-01-18-alex-hormozi-how-to-price-ai-services.md`

3. **Add metadata header** at the top:
   ```markdown
   # [Video Title]

   **Channel**: [Channel Name]
   **URL**: [YouTube URL]
   **Date Watched**: [Date]
   **Length**: [Duration]
   **Why Watching**: [What made you click - the hook or problem you're solving]

   ---

   [Paste transcript below]
   ```

4. **Process it** by asking Claude:
   > "Process this transcript against my agency OS - what's relevant to my objectives?"

5. **Move insights** to `/processed/` after extracting value

---

*Don't let transcripts pile up unprocessed. Weekly: process or delete.*
