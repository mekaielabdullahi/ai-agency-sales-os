# External Sources & Learnings

**Purpose**: Capture tactics, strategies, and insights learned from successful agency owners, courses, podcasts, books, and other external sources. This is your "steal like an artist" repository.

---

## Why This Exists

Elite agencies don't invent everything. They:
1. Learn from those ahead of them
2. Adapt proven tactics to their context
3. Document and systematize what works
4. Evolve faster by standing on shoulders

This folder captures external learnings so they become part of your operating system.

## Processing Workflow

1. **Capture**: When you learn something, dump it here quickly
2. **Process**: Weekly, refine raw notes into structured insights
3. **Test**: Implement one tactic at a time
4. **Validate**: Track if it works for your context
5. **Integrate**: Move validated tactics into `/agency-playbooks/`

---

## Quality Standards

**Good capture**:
- Specific tactic, not vague advice
- Clear application to AriseGroup
- Actionable next step

**Bad capture**:
- "Be authentic" (too vague)
- No application context
- No action item

## Monthly Review Questions

1. What external learnings did I capture this month?
2. Which ones did I actually test?
3. What worked? What didn't?
4. What should be promoted to a playbook?
5. Who should I be learning from that I'm not?
