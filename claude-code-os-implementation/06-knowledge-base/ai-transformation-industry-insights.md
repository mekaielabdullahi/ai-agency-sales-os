## Business Model Fundamentals

### 10X's Core Services

**Two-Pronged Approach:**

1. **Strategy Work**
   - Identify key bottlenecks and problems
   - Map problems to AI use cases
   - Deliver 12-month AI roadmap
   - Move beyond traditional consulting's "50-page deck and good luck" model

2. **Execution**
   - AI engineering-as-a-service
   - Building AI-native products
   - Traditional software development accelerated with AI
   - Focus on production-grade deliverables, not just recommendations

### The Three Founding Criteria

10X was built to satisfy three core requirements:

1. **Control & Freedom**
   - Stay in control of destiny
   - Maintain entrepreneurial freedom
   - Avoid external capital constraints early on

2. **Attract Top Technical Talent**
   - Target: Former founders who want to bet on themselves
   - Competition: Engineers earning tens of millions elsewhere
   - Solution: Unique compensation model (see Talent section)

3. **Recurring Revenue**
   - Avoid advertising's "start from zero every year" model
   - Build stable, predictable cash flows
   - Enable long-term planning and team building

**Why Start with Consulting:**
- No capital required (cash flow from day one)
- Creates maximum surface area for optionality
- Best "petri dish" for discovering IP and product opportunities
- Allows you to get paid while you learn

## The Reality of "AI Transformation"

### The "Trojan Horse" Effect

**Critical Insight:** "AI transformation" is often the **sizzle, not the steak**.

**What This Means:**
- AI is a marketing hook that gets you in the door
- 70-80% of actual work is traditional software development and process optimization
- Prerequisites account for most of the value delivery
- The actual AI component might be "literally one API call"

### The Prerequisites Reality

**Common Pattern Across Projects:**

Every project has a **"Prerequisites"** section that includes:
- Data infrastructure (ETL pipelines, data cleaning)
- Process documentation and optimization
- System integrations
- Basic software infrastructure
- Workflow standardization

**Quote from Nick (Morningside):**
> "We hook them in with 'here's all the amazing AI stuff and you can have this voice agent here' but now let's talk about the prerequisites and what you really need to get done and we probably spend most of our time in those calls."

### Why This Happens

1. **Executives feel pressure** to have an AI point of view
2. **80% of executive wish lists** are actually traditional software needs
3. **Human creativity limitation:** We can't think outside the software paradigm we've been in for 30+ years
4. **Fundamental business issues:** Most companies have never had proper software infrastructure

### The Client Wish List Pattern

When asked what they want AI to do, clients typically request:
- **80%** = Traditional deterministic software
- **20%** = Actual generative AI capabilities

**Key Takeaway:** This isn't a failing of AI—it shows how valuable traditional software remains AND how limited human imagination currently is around AI possibilities.

## Monetization Models

### The Monetization Spectrum

**From "Mercenary" to "Missionary":**

| Model | Description | Risk/Reward | Best For |
|-------|-------------|-------------|----------|
| **Pure Cash-for-Service** | Client pays upfront, owns all upside | Low risk, capped upside | Steady cash flow, smaller opportunities |
| **2-and-20 Model** | Management fee + performance participation | Medium risk, shared upside | Mid-size opportunities with measurable ROI |
| **Co-Ownership/Partnership** | Share equity and risk | High risk, unlimited upside | Large opportunities, strong distribution |
| **Full Ownership (Venture)** | Build and own entirely | Highest risk, highest potential | Maximum opportunity belief |

### The 2-and-20 Model Explained

**Structure:**
- **2% management fee:** Annual fee to cover operational costs
- **20% performance fee:** Share of profits/gains above benchmark

**In AI Transformation Context:**
- Base fee covers build costs and maintains relationship
- Participate in upside when AI drives measurable value
- Metrics: Increased revenue, cost savings, productivity gains
- **Alignment:** Both parties win when implementation succeeds

### Decision Framework: Which Model to Use

**Factors to Consider:**

1. **Size of Opportunity**
   - Small opportunity → Pure cash
   - Medium opportunity → 2-and-20 or partnership
   - Large opportunity → Consider co-ownership

2. **Client Distribution Capability**
   - **Example:** Real estate company with agent network
   - Can they scale solution beyond their organization?
   - Do they want to become a software company?

3. **Client Technical Capability**
   - Limited internal tech → More partnership potential
   - Strong internal tech → More likely cash-for-service

4. **Scalability Beyond Single Client**
   - NBA team: Contained, won't share → Mercenary model
   - Real estate voice-to-contract: Every agent in US → Partnership model

5. **Your Strategic Objectives**
   - Need cash flow → Mercenary
   - Building IP portfolio → Missionary
   - Want recurring revenue → Engineering-as-a-service

### Recurring Revenue Strategies

**Traditional Engineering as a Service:**
- 12-month contracts
- Highly retentive
- Account expansion opportunities
- 5-10 year customer relationships
- Use AI internally to accelerate engineering work

**Making AI Work Recurring:**

**The Challenge:** Most Gen AI projects are project-based

**Potential Solutions:**
1. **Agent-as-Software Model**
   - Position agents as software subscriptions
   - Ongoing maintenance and improvement
   - Feature expansion over time

2. **Platform + Services Model**
   - Build reusable technology assets
   - Custom implementation per client
   - Ongoing support and enhancement

3. **Outcome-Based Pricing**
   - Charge based on usage/value
   - Scales with client success
   - Creates natural retention

## Talent Attraction Strategy

### The Naming Power of "AI"

**Critical Insight:**
> "If we didn't call ourselves an AI transformation firm we wouldn't be able to attract the talent that we've been able to. If we just called ourselves the world's best dev shop, I guarantee you we would not have the engineers in the room that we have." - Alex Lieberman

**Implications:**
- "AI transformation" attracts top technical talent
- "Dev shop" or "software consultancy" doesn't have same pull
- The market positioning affects who applies

### Target Talent Profile

**10X's Approach:**
- **Target:** Former founders (not just engineers)
- **Mindset:** People who want to bet on themselves
- **Compensation:** Structured to reward ownership and impact
- **Culture:** Freedom to explore and innovate

### Why Former Founders?

- **Entrepreneurial mindset:** Solve problems creatively
- **Ownership mentality:** Care about outcomes, not just tasks
- **Business context:** Understand beyond just technical implementation
- **Self-directed:** Don't need hand-holding

---

## The Human Bottleneck

### The Fundamental Rate Limiter

**Key Quote:**
> "One of the most limiting factors in AI right now is actually just human creativity. We don't have an ability to think outside of the box that we've been put inside ever since software was created." - Alex Lieberman

### The 10+ Year Arbitrage

**Alex's Estimate:**
- The arbitrage opportunity at enterprise level is **10+ years**
- **Not because** technology will take 10 years to mature
- **But because** humans will take 10+ years to actually adopt and transform

**Evidence:** Companies still on on-premise servers in 2025
- Cloud computing is 15+ years mature
- Yet mid-market and enterprise still haven't fully migrated
- Human inertia, not technology, is the blocker

### Why Humans Are the Bottleneck

1. **Change Management Complexity**
   - Organizational resistance
   - Politics and turf wars
   - Fear of job loss

2. **Process Inertia**
   - "We've always done it this way"
   - Comfort with current systems
   - Risk aversion

3. **Training and Adoption**
   - Learning curves
   - Workflow changes
   - Cultural transformation needed

4. **Leadership Understanding**
   - Executives know they need AI POV
   - Don't understand what that means
   - Look to consultants to tell them

### Strategic Implication

**For Your Agency:**
- Don't worry about market saturation in next 5 years
- The bottleneck ensures long runway
- Focus on change management and training as core competency
- Human adoption is the most defensible moat

**Quote from discussion:**
> "Training to zero and the only rock there is how people how fast people can be trained up on it and actually use it. That's really the only thing."

## Market Positioning Strategies

### Specialist vs. Generalist Dilemma

**The Specialist Advantage:**

1. **Partnership Positioning**
   - Large software companies (Snowflake, etc.) have 100+ partner managers
   - They organize partners in a matrix:
     - **Vertical:** Industry/vertical specialization
     - **Horizontal:** Company size (SMB, mid-market, enterprise tiers)
   - They want to place you in ONE box
   - Example: "10X is the mid-market partner for healthcare companies doing Snowflake migration"

2. **Trust & Credibility**
   - Decision-makers look for vertical-specific expertise
   - Risk mitigation: "No one got fired for buying IBM"
   - Relevant case studies matter more than general excellence

3. **Go-to-Market Efficiency**
   - Easier to get referrals within vertical
   - Network effects in specific industry
   - Repeatable processes and deliverables

**The Generalist Challenge:**

**When Generalist Works:**
- **Strong personal brand/audience** (like Alex Lieberman)
- Built-in distribution channel
- Trust established outside of vertical expertise

**Why Most Should Specialize:**
- 99% don't have built-in distribution
- Specialization = easier partnership conversations
- Vertical focus = faster word-of-mouth

### The "Digital Franchise" Model

**Concept:** What if you build a general brand (like 10X) but create vertical-specific subsidiaries?

**Structure Options:**

1. **Same Team, Different Landing Pages**
   - 10X Industrial
   - 10X Retail
   - 10X Healthcare
   - Same engineers, specialized marketing

2. **Dedicated Pods**
   - Engineers organized by vertical
   - Shared infrastructure
   - Vertical-specific expertise development

3. **Actual Franchises**
   - Independent operators
   - Licensing brand and methodology
   - Central quality control

**Benefits:**
- Capture specialist positioning benefits
- Maintain centralized operational excellence
- Scale brand across multiple verticals
- Share talent pool when needed

### Path to Specialization

**Recommended Approach (from Alex to aspiring consultant in Europe):**

1. **Start with Context**
   - Industrial/manufacturing background
   - Located in Eastern Europe
   - AI/ML engineering expertise

2. **Build Local Authority**
   - Host dinners with manufacturing C-suite in geography
   - 5-10 key decision makers

3. **Win First Customer**
   - Do exceptional work
   - Over-deliver on value

4. **Generate Referrals**
   - Leverage first customer for intros
   - Stay in same vertical

5. **Approach Software Partners**
   - Position as "mid-market industrial AI transformation partner"
   - Fill their partnership gap
   - Leverage their lead flow

## Future Industry Predictions

### Explosion of Specialists (Next 12 Months)

**Alex's Prediction:**
- Currently ~1,000 AI transformation firms doing $1M+ in US
- **Will 10x to 10,000 firms in next year**
- Most will specialize by industry
- "Path of least resistance" for anyone with business sense

### Category Deletion

**Arman's Insight:**
> "Some SaaS categories will probably just be deleted. A data lake might not need to exist in 5 years because the concept of a data lake is to take differently structured data and bring it into one system. AI is really good at turning differently structured data into a single structure—unstructured to structure is uniquely what AI is capable of."

**Implications:**
- Complexity is no longer a moat
- Traditional category boundaries will blur
- Custom AI-powered solutions replace horizontal SaaS
- Opportunity to rebuild entire software stacks

### Custom Software Renaissance

**The Trend:**
- Small businesses: Already replacing software stacks with custom solutions
- AI-powered development makes custom software economically feasible
- What used to take 12 months now takes 6 months (and decreasing)

**Potential Future State:**
1. **Small Business:** DIY AI platforms (Google Gemini + cloud services)
2. **Mid-Market:** AI transformation partners build custom infrastructure
3. **Enterprise:** Internal AI teams + strategic partners

### The Platformization Question

**Will Google/Microsoft/AWS Build DIY Platforms?**

**Likely for SMB:**
- Chat-based setup: "Tell me about your business"
- Select modules: CRM, Chat, ToDo, Scheduling
- Auto-generated custom software
- Hosted on provider's cloud

**Why Mid-Market/Enterprise Still Need Partners:**
- "Dirty work" of transformation
- Legacy system integration
- Change management
- Custom complex workflows
- Political/organizational challenges

### McKinsey's Hidden SaaS Portfolio

**Industry Pattern:**
- McKinsey has been acquiring SaaS companies for years
- Recognizes consulting alone won't be recurring revenue
- Leaves behind software tools with clients
- Blends consulting + software ownership

**Lesson:** The smartest consultancies are becoming software companies

## Strategic Frameworks

### The "Center of Innovation" Model

**From Arman (based on "The Innovators" by Walter Isaacson):**

**The Fundamental Equation:**
1. **Brilliant people in a room**
2. **Forcing function** (direction/goal)
3. **Freedom** (financial, creative, exploratory)

**Historical Evolution of Innovation Centers:**

| Era | Format | Funding | Example |
|-----|--------|---------|---------|
| 1500s | Exploration | Government | Christopher Columbus |
| 1960s | Defense Research | Government | ARPANET |
| 1970s-2000s | University Research | Gov't + Private | Bell Labs, MIT |
| 2010s+ | Corporate Research | Private | Google X, OpenAI |
| **2025+** | **Cash-Flow Funded Research** | **Self-funded via services** | **10X, Morningside** |

**The New Model:**
- Generate cash flows through consulting/services
- Support team of genius-level talent
- Create freedom to explore and build IP
- Research leads to product opportunities
- Products may spin out or scale

**Why This Works:**
1. No dilution from VC capital
2. Market-validated research (paying clients = real problems)
3. Talent attracted to both stability AND innovation
4. Multiple paths to success

### CTO vs CPO Spectrum

**Where Do You Sit on Service Delivery?**

**Pure CTO (Order Taker):**
- Client provides PRD
- You execute to spec
- Less strategic influence
- Commodity positioning

**CPO (Strategic Partner):**
- Help define product direction
- Create the PRD together
- Consultative relationship
- Premium positioning

**10X's Preference:** Skew toward CPO

**Why:**
1. Set right expectations from start
2. Can share perspective on tech/product direction
3. Most contacts aren't CTOs (they're CEOs/COOs)
4. Non-technical executives need product guidance, not just execution

**When This Matters Most:**
- CEO feels things aren't moving fast enough
- COO brought you in around existing tech team
- CFO wants better ROI on tech spend
- No strong product leadership in organization

### The Five-Path Framework

**Every AI Transformation Business Can Pursue Multiple Paths:**

1. **Cash-Flow Services (Mercenary)**
   - Consulting + implementation
   - Charge premium rates
   - Recurring revenue through retainers
   - Fund operations and team

2. **Strategic Partnerships (2-and-20)**
   - Base fees + upside participation
   - Share in measurable outcomes
   - Medium risk, medium reward
   - Aligned incentives

3. **Co-Owned IP (Missionary)**
   - Build solutions with clients
   - Share equity in resulting tools
   - High risk, high reward
   - Requires right opportunity

4. **Internal Product Development**
   - Build on your own
   - Use agency as distribution
   - Full ownership
   - Highest risk/reward

5. **Platform/Technology Assets**
   - Reusable building blocks
   - Accelerate delivery
   - Improve margins
   - IP accumulation

**Strategic Insight:** You don't pick ONE path—you maintain optionality across all five, deploying the right model for each opportunity.

## Critical Quotes

### On the Reality of AI Work

> "If we didn't call ourselves an AI transformation firm we wouldn't be able to attract the talent that we've been able to. If we just called ourselves the world's best dev shop, I guarantee you we would not have the engineers in the room that we have." - Alex Lieberman

> "The AI thing is very much like marketing right now. It is marketing...it's the Trojan horse that gets someone interested in what we're doing but is not ultimately like that's the sizzle not the steak." - Alex Lieberman

### On Human Bottlenecks

> "One of the most limiting factors in AI right now is actually just human creativity. We don't have an ability to think outside of the box that we've been put inside ever since software was created." - Alex Lieberman

> "Humans are our own worst enemy. Humans are the bottleneck in all of this." - Alex Lieberman

> "The arbitrage opportunity at the mid-market and enterprise level is 10+ years. Not because the technology is going to take 10 years to get to a point where everyone shouldn't be replaced, but because humans are going to stay in the way of effectively replacing ourselves." - Alex Lieberman

### On Building the Business

> "Every audience like every marketing channel on planet earth the value decays to zero at some point. Literally like no marketing channel has ever defied that rule of physics for marketing." - Alex Lieberman

> "If you give us a long enough timeline, you give us 10 years, I say shame on us for not figuring out what's the next arbitrage to arb when the current one has closed." - Alex Lieberman

> "The way we think about it is basically like what is our objective and I really think like by the end of next year I want an army of the most genius people that we can get our hands on working on really really interesting problems that get us excited to come to work every day." - Arman

### On Specialization

> "No one got fired for buying IBM. Every person makes a decision where the risk profile looks such that they won't get fired and you're way less likely to get fired if you pick the service provider who's done similar work before." - Alex Lieberman
