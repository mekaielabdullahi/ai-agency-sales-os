# Strategic Alignment Framework

**Purpose**: Ensure every activity serves the One Big Obsessional Goal (OBG)
**Source**: Claude Code OS Core Principles

---

## Overview

Strategic Alignment is the practice of continuously verifying that current work advances the primary business objective. It prevents strategic drift and wasted effort.

**Core Question**: "Does this serve the OBG?"

---

## The Framework

### Step 1: Define Your OBG (One Big Obsessional Goal)

**Characteristics of Good OBG**:
- **Singular**: One goal, not multiple
- **Obsessional**: Worthy of intense focus
- **Measurable**: Clear success criteria
- **Time-bound**: Specific timeframe (usually 6-12 months)
- **Transformational**: Meaningful business impact

**Example OBGs**:
- ✅ "Scale AriseGroup.ai to $10K/month sustainable revenue by Q2 2026"
- ✅ "Acquire 50 paying customers for SaaS product by June 2026"
- ✅ "Raise $2M seed round by March 2026"
- ❌ "Grow the business" (too vague)
- ❌ "Increase revenue and improve product" (not singular)

---

### Step 2: Alignment Check (Daily)

For every task/activity, ask:

**Level 1: Direct Alignment**
"Does this DIRECTLY advance the OBG?"
- Example: If OBG is revenue, does this create/close deals?
- If YES → Proceed
- If NO → Continue to Level 2

**Level 2: Indirect Alignment**
"Does this ENABLE activities that advance OBG?"
- Example: Creating client frameworks enables sales conversations
- If YES → Proceed (but question if there's more direct path)
- If NO → Continue to Level 3

**Level 3: Infrastructure**
"Is this REQUIRED infrastructure for OBG?"
- Example: Legal compliance, essential systems
- If YES → Schedule appropriately (not peak hours)
- If NO → **KILL IT**

---

### Step 3: Weekly Alignment Audit

Every week, review:

**Planned Activities**:
- What's on my plan for this week?
- How does each activity serve OBG?
- What's the chain of logic?

**Completed Activities** (Last Week):
- What did I actually do?
- How much directly served OBG?
- What was waste?

**Calculation**:
```
Alignment % = (Hours on OBG-serving work / Total work hours) × 100
```

**Targets**:
- **Excellent**: 70%+ directly aligned
- **Good**: 50-70% aligned
- **Needs Work**: <50% aligned
- **Strategic Drift**: <30% aligned

---

### Step 4: Quarterly Realignment

Every quarter:

**Review OBG**:
- Is this still the right goal?
- Has market/situation changed?
- Should OBG evolve?

**Review Alignment**:
- What activities consumed time but didn't serve OBG?
- What patterns of drift occurred?
- What new activities should be added?
- What should be eliminated?

## Decision Matrix

| Activity Type | Serves OBG? | Required? | Action |
|--------------|-------------|-----------|---------|
| Direct revenue activity | ✅ Direct | ✅ Yes | DO (Peak hours) |
| Enables revenue | ✅ Indirect | ✅ Yes | DO (Good hours) |
| Infrastructure | ❌ No | ✅ Yes | SCHEDULE (Off-peak) |
| Nice to have | ❌ No | ❌ No | KILL |
| Exploration/Learning | ❌ No | ❌ No | DEFER |
| Other people's priorities | ❌ No | ❌ No | DECLINE |

## Common Misalignments

### 1. **Building Instead of Selling**
**Pattern**: Creating more features/systems instead of client work
**OBG**: Revenue growth
**Why It Happens**: Building feels productive and safe
**Solution**: Set rule - "No new building until X client conversations"

### 2. **Perfection Over Progress**
**Pattern**: Endless refinement of existing work
**OBG**: Market validation
**Why It Happens**: Fear of shipping imperfect work
**Solution**: 80% rule - ship at 80%, refine based on feedback

### 3. **Learning Over Earning**
**Pattern**: Courses, research, exploration instead of execution
**OBG**: Revenue
**Why It Happens**: Learning feels like progress
**Solution**: Just-in-time learning only

### 4. **Busy Work Over Big Work**
**Pattern**: Email, admin, organizing instead of strategic work
**OBG**: Growth
**Why It Happens**: Big work is hard and scary
**Solution**: Tier 1 = big work only

### 5. **Other People's Emergencies**
**Pattern**: Constantly dropping your work for others
**OBG**: Your business growth
**Why It Happens**: Poor boundaries
**Solution**: "I can help after [Tier 1 complete]"

## Alignment Examples

### Example: OBG = "Scale AriseGroup.ai to $10K MRR"

**Aligned Activities**:
- ✅ Client outreach (direct)
- ✅ Discovery calls (direct)
- ✅ Proposal creation (direct)
- ✅ LinkedIn posts (indirect - builds pipeline)
- ✅ AI Readiness Audit creation (enables sales)

**Misaligned Activities**:
- ❌ Building new internal agents (not client-facing)
- ❌ Perfecting existing documentation (nice to have)
- ❌ Exploring new tools (not urgent)
- ❌ Organizing file system (not revenue)
- ❌ Learning new framework (not needed now)

**Borderline** (Evaluate):
- ⚠️ Template creation (only if speeds up client delivery)
- ⚠️ Process documentation (only if enables delegation)
- ⚠️ Content research (only if directly feeds posts)

## Integration with Weekly Planning

**Week Start**:
1. Review OBG
2. Define THE ONE THING for week (must serve OBG)
3. Plan daily activities that serve THE ONE THING
4. Create kill list of misaligned activities

**Week End**:
1. Calculate alignment %
2. Identify drift patterns
3. Adjust next week's plan

## Templates

### Daily Alignment Check

```markdown
## OBG:
[Your One Big Obsessional Goal]

## Today's THE ONE THING:
[How it serves OBG]

## Alignment Check:
- Tier 1 tasks: [How each serves OBG]
- Tier 2 tasks: [How each serves OBG]
- Kill list: [What doesn't serve OBG]

## Alignment Score (End of Day):
- Hours on OBG-aligned work: ___
- Total work hours: ___
- Alignment %: ___
```

### Weekly Alignment Audit

```markdown
## This Week's OBG Progress:
[Specific advancement toward goal]

## Time Allocation:
- Direct OBG work: ___ hours (___%)
- Indirect OBG work: ___ hours (___%)
- Infrastructure: ___ hours (___%)
- Misaligned: ___ hours (___%)
- **Total Alignment**: ____%

## Drift Analysis:
What consumed time but didn't serve OBG?
- [Activity 1]
- [Activity 2]

## Next Week Adjustment:
Based on this week's data, I will:
- INCREASE: [OBG-aligned activity]
- DECREASE: [Misaligned activity]
- ELIMINATE: [Complete waste]
```

## Warning Signs of Drift

**You're drifting when**:
- Can't explain how today's work serves OBG
- Haven't touched OBG-critical work in 3+ days
- Alignment % below 50%
- More time on building than deploying (when OBG is revenue)
- Responding to others' priorities more than your own
- Feeling busy but not progressing toward OBG

**Course Correct**:
1. STOP current activity
2. Review OBG
3. Identify most direct path to OBG progress
4. Do THAT immediately

---

## Success Metrics

**Strong Alignment**:
- Can explain OBG → Weekly Goal → Daily Task chain instantly
- 70%+ time on direct/indirect OBG work
- Weekly measurable progress toward OBG
- Confidently saying "no" to non-aligned opportunities

**Weak Alignment**:
- Unclear how daily work serves OBG
- <50% time aligned
- OBG hasn't progressed in weeks
- Saying "yes" to everything
