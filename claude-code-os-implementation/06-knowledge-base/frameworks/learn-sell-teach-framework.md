# Learn → Sell → Teach Framework

## Overview

The **Learn → Sell → Teach** framework is a three-phase business model for building a sustainable AI services agency that scales from solo operator to productized knowledge business.

**Core Pattern**: Learn a valuable AI skill → Sell it as a service (agency-style) → Package what works into scalable offers like courses, programs, or communities, while continuing to run the agency to keep the knowledge fresh.

**Key Benefit**: Creates a feedback loop where client work improves the product, and the product/community feeds new insights back into the client offers, avoiding the "fake guru" trap of teaching without ongoing real-world execution.

## Business Model: Core Economics

### Primary Goal
Build a **10-20k/month AI services business** as a base, with upside to higher income as products and community scale.

### Realistic Targets
- **10-20k/month as solo operator**: Very realistic and achievable
- **$1M in a year**: Unlikely for most, but possible with scale
- **Foundation for growth**: Strong base for bigger outcomes later

### Why This Model Works
1. **Low capital requirements** - No inventory, physical space, or heavy infrastructure
2. **Beginner-friendly** - Can start with one AI skill, learn as you go
3. **Growing market** - Rapid AI adoption by small businesses creates demand
4. **Compounding value** - Client work → insights → products → more clients

**Purpose**: Personal "content brain" for high-volume content generation

**How it works**:
1. Feed it transcripts, notes, examples, research
2. AI generates short posts, scripts, hooks, carousels, email ideas

4. Auto-schedules sales calls with qualified leads

**Use cases**:
- "AI Audit" outreach to service businesses

3. Keep curriculum current as tools/strategies evolve
4. Expand courses without full production process

**Use cases**:
- "AI Agency Blueprint" course

## Success Principles

### Principle 1: Specificity Wins
- **Not**: "I do AI stuff"
- **Yes**: "I build AI voice agents for dental offices"

Narrow focus → clearer messaging → easier sales

---

### Principle 2: Real Work > Teaching Only
- Continue agency work even after teaching scales
- 2-4 clients/month keeps you current
- Credibility comes from ongoing practice
- Insights come from real implementations

---

### Principle 3: Build in Public
- Share learnings on social media
- Document client wins (anonymized)
- Show process, not just results
- Authenticity > polish

---

### Principle 4: Feedback Loop
- Client work improves teaching
- Teaching questions reveal new client opportunities
- Community validates (or invalidates) assumptions
- Continuous learning and iteration

---

### Principle 5: Start Small, Scale Smart
- **Month 1**: Choose lane, learn tool
- **Month 3**: First client
- **Month 6**: Consistent $10-20K/month
- **Month 12**: Add teaching layer
- **Year 2**: Scale to $50-100K+/month

Don't try to do all three phases at once.

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

### Pitfall 1: Learning Forever, Never Selling
**Symptom**: "I need to learn more before I can offer services"
**Fix**: Get 5-10 steps ahead, then start selling. Learn as you go.

---

### Pitfall 2: Teaching Before Doing
**Symptom**: "I'll create a course on AI automation" (never built automation for clients)
**Fix**: Sell services first, prove the model, then teach what worked.

---

### Pitfall 3: Trying All Lanes at Once
**Symptom**: "I'll offer education, apps, voice agents, and automation"
**Fix**: Pick ONE lane, master it, scale it, then expand.

---

### Pitfall 4: Dropping Agency for Teaching Too Early
**Symptom**: "I have 100 community members, I'm going to stop client work"
**Fix**: Maintain 2-4 clients/month even as teaching scales. Stay fresh.

---

### Pitfall 5: Generic Positioning
**Symptom**: "AI solutions for businesses"
**Fix**: "AI voice agents for dental offices" or "Make.com automation for e-commerce"

---
