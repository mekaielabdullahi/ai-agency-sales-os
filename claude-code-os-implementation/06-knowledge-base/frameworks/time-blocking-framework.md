# Time Blocking Framework

**Purpose**: Allocate specific time blocks to specific work types based on energy levels
**Source**: Claude Code OS + Weekly Planning Methodology

---

## Overview

Time Blocking matches task complexity to energy levels, ensuring peak hours are used for highest-impact work.

**Core Principle**: "Peak energy = Peak impact work"

---

## Energy Levels Throughout Day

### Peak Energy (Usually Morning)
**Characteristics**:
- Mental clarity highest
- Focus easily sustained
- Complex problem-solving possible
- Creative thinking flows

**Best For**:
- Strategic work
- Complex creation
- Important decision-making
- Client-facing work
- THE ONE THING execution

**Protect This Time**: No meetings, no email, no interruptions

---

### High Energy (Late Morning/Early Afternoon)
**Characteristics**:
- Still good focus
- Can handle complexity
- Slightly more distractible
- Good for execution

**Best For**:
- Continuation of peak work
- Important communications
- Collaborative work
- Client calls (if peak not available)

---

### Medium Energy (Mid-Afternoon)
**Characteristics**:
- Focus requires effort
- Better for structured tasks
- Collaboration easier than solo deep work

**Best For**:
- Meetings
- Email management
- Routine execution
- Admin tasks
- Planning next day

---

### Low Energy (Late Afternoon/Evening)
**Characteristics**:
- Limited focus capacity
- Easily distracted
- Better for routine work

**Best For**:
- Email cleanup
- Social media engagement
- Light admin
- Planning/organizing
- Reading/learning (low-stakes)

**Avoid**:
- Important decisions
- Complex creation
- Client-facing work
- THE ONE THING

---

## The Framework

### Step 1: Identify Your Energy Pattern

**Track for 1 Week**:
- Rate energy 1-10 every 2 hours
- Note when you feel most focused
- Identify natural slumps

**Common Patterns**:
- **Morning Person**: Peak 8-12, decline after lunch
- **Afternoon Person**: Slow start, peak 2-6
- **Night Owl**: Peak after dinner (less common for professional work)

**Your Pattern Matters More Than "Best Practices"**

---

### Step 2: Design Your Ideal Day Template

**Template Structure**:

**[Peak Energy Block] (4 hours max)**
- THE ONE THING
- Deep work only
- No meetings
- No email
- Phone off/DND

**[Break] (15-30 min)**
- Actual break (walk, eat, rest)
- Not "just check email"

**[High Energy Block] (2-3 hours)**
- Important but less complex work
- Communications
- Collaborative work

**[Break] (15 min)**

**[Medium Energy Block] (1-2 hours)**
- Routine work
- Admin
- Emails
- Planning

**[Wrap-up] (30 min)**
- Daily assessment
- Tomorrow's THE ONE THING
- Inbox zero if possible

---

### Step 3: Block Your Calendar

**Rules**:
1. **Peak block is sacred** - treat like client meeting you can't cancel
2. **Schedule THE ONE THING first** - everything else fills around it
3. **Batch similar work** - all email together, all calls together
4. **Protect transitions** - buffer between very different work types
5. **Plan breaks** - they're not optional

---

## Example Time Blocks

### Part-Time Schedule (3-4 hours/day)

**Option A: Morning Focus**
```
8:00-8:30   - Morning routine, coffee, review THE ONE THING
8:30-11:00  - PEAK BLOCK: THE ONE THING execution
11:00-11:15 - Break
11:15-12:00 - High energy: Communications/follow-up
12:00-12:15 - Wrap-up, tomorrow prep
```

**Option B: Afternoon Focus**
```
2:00-2:15   - Transition, review THE ONE THING
2:15-4:45   - PEAK BLOCK: THE ONE THING execution
4:45-5:00   - Break
5:00-5:45   - Medium energy: Admin/emails
5:45-6:00   - Wrap-up
```

---

### Full-Time Schedule (6-7 hours/day)

**Morning Peak Pattern**:
```
8:00-8:30   - Morning routine, review plan
8:30-12:00  - PEAK BLOCK: THE ONE THING (3.5 hours)
12:00-1:00  - Lunch + actual break
1:00-3:00   - HIGH ENERGY: Secondary important work
3:00-3:15   - Break
3:15-4:45   - MEDIUM ENERGY: Meetings, email, admin
4:45-5:15   - WRAP-UP: Planning, assessment
```

**Afternoon Peak Pattern**:
```
9:00-9:30   - Morning routine, warm-up work
9:30-11:30  - HIGH ENERGY: Secondary important work
11:30-12:30 - Lunch
12:30-12:45 - Transition
12:45-4:15  - PEAK BLOCK: THE ONE THING (3.5 hours)
4:15-4:30   - Break
4:30-5:30   - MEDIUM ENERGY: Wrap-up, admin
```

## Common Mistakes

### Mistake 1: Scheduling Meetings During Peak Hours
**Impact**: Waste best hours on routine conversations
**Fix**: "I'm available 2-5 PM for meetings"

### Mistake 2: "I'll Just Check Email Quickly"
**Impact**: Peak block destroyed by reactive work
**Fix**: Email is medium-energy work. Schedule it.

### Mistake 3: No Breaks
**Impact**: Energy depletes faster, afternoon useless
**Fix**: Breaks are not optional. They're strategic.

### Mistake 4: Fighting Your Natural Pattern
**Impact**: Constant struggle, lower output
**Fix**: Work WITH your energy, not against it

### Mistake 5: Overloading Peak Block
**Impact**: Try to do 6 hours of peak work in 3 hours
**Fix**: ONE THING only. That's it.

## Week-Level Time Blocking

### Monday: Planning + Launch
- Peak: Strategic planning, THE ONE THING
- High: Setup week's work
- Medium: Admin, meetings

### Tuesday-Thursday: Execution
- Peak: THE ONE THING execution
- High: Secondary Tier 1 tasks
- Medium: Communications, coordination

### Friday: Completion + Planning
- Peak: Finish week's THE ONE THING
- High: Week assessment
- Medium: Next week planning

## Templates

### Daily Time Block Template

```markdown
## Energy Level Today: [Peak/High/Medium/Low] (adjust blocks if off)

## Peak Energy Block ([Start]-[End])
**THE ONE THING**: [Single focus]
- No meetings
- No email
- Phone on DND
- [Specific task breakdown]

## High Energy Block ([Start]-[End])
**Secondary Work**:
- [Task 1]
- [Task 2]

## Medium Energy Block ([Start]-[End])
**Routine Work**:

```

---

## Success Metrics

**Doing It Right**:
- THE ONE THING gets peak hours consistently
- Peak block rarely interrupted
- Energy level matches task complexity
- Afternoons don't feel wasted
- End day with key work complete (not just busy work)

**Doing It Wrong**:
- Meetings scheduled during peak hours
- Email first thing in morning
- THE ONE THING happens "when I find time"
- Peak hours on low-value work
- Constantly exhausted
