# Brutal Prioritization Framework

**Source**: Claude Code OS Core Principles + Weekly Planning Methodology
**Purpose**: Eliminate 80% of activities to focus on the 20% that creates 80% of impact

---

## Overview

Brutal Prioritization is the systematic elimination of good activities to make room for great ones. It's not about doing more efficiently—it's about doing radically less, better.

**Core Principle**: "Spartan Rule - Lean operations through one obsession and brutal elimination"

---

## The Framework

### Step 1: Identify THE ONE THING

**Question**: "What's the single most important outcome for [timeframe]?"

**Rules**:
- Must be singular (not 2-3 things)
- Must be specific and measurable
- Must align with OBG (One Big Obsessional Goal)
- If you achieve nothing else, this must be done

**Example**:
- ❌ Bad: "Work on sales and marketing"
- ✅ Good: "Schedule 2 discovery calls with qualified prospects"

### Step 2: Three-Tier Classification

**Tier 1**: Must complete (20% of tasks, 80% of impact)
- Directly serves THE ONE THING
- Has deadline TODAY or very soon
- Only you can do it
- High consequence if not done

**Tier 2**: Should complete (nice to have)
- Supports THE ONE THING indirectly
- Has flexible deadline
- Could be delegated
- Medium consequence if delayed

**Tier 3**: Could complete (probably don't)
- Doesn't serve THE ONE THING
- No real deadline
- Low impact
- Negligible consequence if never done

**Critical Rule**: ONLY DO TIER 1 until it's complete

### Step 3: The Kill List

Create explicit list of what NOT to do this [day/week/month].

**Kill List Categories**:

**❌ Perfection Paralysis**
- Over-editing documents
- Endless refinement
- Research without execution
- Planning instead of doing

**❌ Scope Creep**
- "Just one more feature"
- Expanding project beyond original scope
- Adding requirements mid-execution

**❌ False Productivity**
- Busy work that feels productive
- Email ping-pong
- Meetings without clear outcomes
- Organizing instead of executing

**❌ Shiny Objects**
- New ideas mid-execution
- "Better" ways to do current work
- Tool exploration when current tools work
- Learning for learning's sake

**❌ Low-Impact Activities**
- Tasks that don't serve OBG
- Nice-to-haves masquerading as must-haves
- Other people's priorities

### Step 4: Apply Elimination Questions

For every task/activity, ask:

**1. Elimination**: "What happens if I don't do this at all?"
- If answer is "nothing significant" → Kill it

**2. Delegation**: "Does this require my unique skills?"
- If no → Delegate or delete

**3. Simplification**: "What's the minimum viable version?"
- If there's a simpler way → Do that instead

**4. Timing**: "Does this need to be done NOW?"
- If no → Defer to later tier

**5. Alignment**: "Does this serve THE ONE THING?"
- If no → Kill it or defer

## Application Examples

### Daily Planning

**Before Brutal Prioritization**:
- Answer emails (30 min)
- Update project docs (45 min)
- Attend team meeting (60 min)
- Research new tool (30 min)
- Client outreach (15 min)
- Write blog post (60 min)
- Social media engagement (20 min)
- Organize files (20 min)

**THE ONE THING**: Send 8 personalized client outreach messages

**After Brutal Prioritization**:

**Tier 1** (Must Do):
- Client outreach (60 min with proper research)

**Tier 2** (Should Do):
- Answer critical emails only (15 min)
- Team meeting if agenda serves OBG (skip if not)

**Tier 3** (Eliminate):
- Update docs (can wait)
- Research tool (not urgent)
- Blog post (not THE ONE THING today)
- Social media (can wait)
- Organize files (never urgent)

**Kill List**:
- ❌ No tool research
- ❌ No documentation updates
- ❌ No social media
- ❌ No "getting organized"

**Result**: 3-4 hours → 1-1.5 hours, focused on what matters

---

### Weekly Planning

**Before**: 20+ goals for the week

**THE ONE THING**: "Deploy client-ready assets and initiate first revenue conversations"

**After Brutal Prioritization**:

**Tier 1** (This Week):
- Finalize AI Readiness Audit
- Send 30-40 personalized outreach messages
- Publish 2 LinkedIn posts
- Respond to all prospect replies
- Schedule any discovery calls

**Tier 2** (If Time):
- Create sample audit
- Refine templates
- Engage on LinkedIn

**Tier 3** (Next Week):
- Build new agents
- Perfect documentation
- Explore new tools
- Optimization projects

**Kill List**:
- ❌ No building new systems
- ❌ No perfecting existing systems
- ❌ No "one more template"
- ❌ No exploration/research
- ❌ No non-client activities

## Decision Tree

```
Is this task THE ONE THING?
├─ YES → Tier 1 (Do first, focus completely)
└─ NO → Does it directly enable THE ONE THING?
    ├─ YES → Tier 2 (Do after Tier 1 complete)
    └─ NO → Does it have hard deadline TODAY?
        ├─ YES → Evaluate: Is consequence severe?
        │   ├─ YES → Tier 1
        │   └─ NO → Tier 2 or Kill
        └─ NO → Does it serve OBG at all?
            ├─ YES → Tier 3 (Do later, maybe)
            └─ NO → KILL (Don't do, ever)
```

## Common Pitfalls

### Pitfall 1: "Everything is Important"
**Symptom**: 10+ Tier 1 tasks
**Reality**: If everything is Tier 1, nothing is
**Solution**: Force rank. Only 1-3 tasks can be Tier 1

### Pitfall 2: "I Can Do Both"
**Symptom**: Attempting Tier 1 + Tier 2 simultaneously
**Reality**: Context switching kills both
**Solution**: Tier 1 ONLY until complete, then Tier 2

### Pitfall 3: "But It Only Takes 5 Minutes"
**Symptom**: Death by 1000 small tasks
**Reality**: 20× "5 minute" tasks = 100 minutes of context switching
**Solution**: Batch or kill small tasks

### Pitfall 4: "I'll Just Quickly..."
**Symptom**: Starting Tier 3 tasks mid-Tier 1 execution
**Reality**: "Quickly" becomes 30-60 minutes
**Solution**: Write it down for later, return to Tier 1

### Pitfall 5: "Other People's Emergencies"
**Symptom**: Dropping THE ONE THING for someone else's priority
**Reality**: Your lack of boundaries enables their lack of planning
**Solution**: "I can help with this after [time when Tier 1 complete]"

## Success Metrics

**You're doing it right when**:
- You have 1 ONE THING (not 3)
- You have 1-3 Tier 1 tasks max
- Your kill list is longer than your do list
- You say "no" to good opportunities
- You feel focused, not scattered
- You complete Tier 1 by midday
- You have margin in your day

**You're doing it wrong when**:
- You have 5+ "priorities"
- Everything feels urgent
- You're constantly context switching
- You end day exhausted but unclear what you accomplished
- Tier 1 tasks roll to tomorrow repeatedly

---

## Integration with Other Frameworks

**Works With**:
- **OBG Alignment**: Brutal prioritization serves THE ONE BIG GOAL
- **Zero Friction**: Fewer tasks = less friction
- **Time Blocking**: Tier 1 gets peak energy blocks
- **Weekly Planning**: THE ONE THING for week guides daily prioritization
