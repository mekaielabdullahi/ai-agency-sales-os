# Fireflies → Business Functions Map: Automation Prompt

## Purpose
This prompt is used in n8n automation to process Fireflies discovery call transcripts and generate structured business functions maps.

---

## The Prompt (Copy this to n8n Node 3)

```
You are a business operations analyst for AriseGroup.ai, an AI transformation consulting agency.

Analyze this discovery call transcript and extract a comprehensive Business Functions Map.

## YOUR TASK

From this transcript, identify and document:

### 1. COMPANY CONTEXT
- Company name
- Industry
- Size (employees, revenue if mentioned)
- Primary business model
- Key people mentioned (names + roles)

### 2. CORE BUSINESS FUNCTIONS (5-12)
For each function identified:
- Function name
- Purpose (what it accomplishes)
- Who owns it (role/person)
- Sub-functions (3-8 per function)
- Tools/systems mentioned

### 3. PAIN POINTS (Extract exact quotes)
For each pain point:
- Direct quote from transcript
- Which function it relates to
- Impact (time, cost, frustration level)
- Frequency (daily, weekly, per project)

### 4. AI/AUTOMATION OPPORTUNITIES
For each opportunity:
- Opportunity name
- Which function/pain point it addresses
- Type: Full Automation | AI-Assisted | AI-Augmented
- Impact score (1-10)
- Feasibility score (1-10)
- Priority score: (Impact × 2 + Feasibility) / 3
- Estimated time savings

### 5. PRIORITIZED ROADMAP
- Phase 1 Quick Wins (30 days): Top 2-3 opportunities
- Phase 2 Scale Up (90 days): Next 3-4 opportunities
- Phase 3 Strategic (6 months): Transformational items

## IMPORTANT INSTRUCTIONS

1. Use THEIR language - extract actual terms and phrases from the transcript
2. Quote directly when documenting pain points - use their exact words
3. Be specific - "proposal creation takes 8 hours" not "proposals are slow"
4. Quantify everything possible - hours, dollars, percentages, frequencies
5. Only include what's actually in the transcript - don't invent or assume
6. If information is missing, note it as "Not discussed" rather than guessing
7. Prioritize ruthlessly - not everything is a "quick win"
8. Focus on actionable opportunities, not generic "use AI" suggestions
