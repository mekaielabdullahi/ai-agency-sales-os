## 🔄 How to Use

**Before Building New Components**:
1. Review [[system-architecture.md]] for design patterns
2. Check [[agent-creation-guide.md]] for agent-specific guidance
3. Reference [[specific-examples.md]] for implementation patterns

**During Development**:
1. Follow architectural principles
2. Maintain consistency with existing patterns
3. Document new patterns discovered

**After Implementation**:
1. Update architecture docs with learnings
2. Add examples to [[specific-examples.md]]
3. Refine guides based on experience
