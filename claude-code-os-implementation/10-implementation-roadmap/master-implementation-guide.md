## Final Advice

> "Start today, start simple, but start. Every day you delay is a day without compound productivity gains. The system will never be perfect on day one, but it will be transformative by day 30."

Remember: You're not building software, you're building a second brain that gets smarter every day. Trust the process, follow the principles, and watch your productivity transform.
