## Issues Found

### Carried Over (Unresolved from Feb 9)
1. **gamma-discovery-deck-prompt.md** still untracked — needs commit
2. **`__pycache__/`** still not in .gitignore
3. **Slack token** expired since Jan 29 — now 14+ days, blocks client-onboarding + slack modules
4. **CLIENT_FEEDBACK_DB_ID** not configured
5. **GOOGLE_AUTH_TOKEN** not configured for notebooklm

### Data Quality Issues
6. **TD-004 stale:** Says "8 n8n workflow exports" but actual count is 15
7. **DEBT-REGISTER.md** last updated 2026-02-03 — 9 days without update
8. **0 debt items resolved** since register was created (Jan 22)

### Stale Items
9. **5 remote branches** likely deletable (some from January)
10. **Agent Teams branch** still experimental, no merge timeline
11. **No weekly report** generated this week

3. Refresh Slack tokens (blocks 2 modules)
4. Run /weekly-report
5. Follow up Steve Tobey / Hawkwood — advance from discovery to proposal

### Debt Maintenance
