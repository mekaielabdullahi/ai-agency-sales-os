## Changes Detected

### Code Changes
- None — 0 commits since last sync

### Inventory Corrections
- **Skills: 13, not 12** — `/tasks` skill (commit `14fab1f`, Feb 9) was missed by the Feb 12 sync. Now added to skills-inventory.md.
- **Internal projects: 5, not 3** — `audit-beta-application` and `checklist-app-requirements` were not documented in any previous sync.
- **gamma-discovery-deck-prompt.md resolved** — Was flagged as untracked since Feb 5; confirmed committed as `13281a6`. Removed from issues list.
- **TD-004 corrected** — DEBT-REGISTER.md still said "8 n8n workflow exports" despite Feb 12 sync noting 15. Updated directly in register.
- **DEBT-REGISTER.md refreshed** — Was stale at 2026-02-03 (10 days old). Timestamp updated.

## Issues Found

### Carried Over (Unresolved)
1. **`__pycache__/`** still not in .gitignore (flagged Feb 9 — 4 days)
2. **Slack token** expired (flagged Jan 29 — 15+ days, blocks 2 modules)
3. **CLIENT_FEEDBACK_DB_ID** not configured
4. **GOOGLE_AUTH_TOKEN** not configured for notebooklm

### Debt Register Concerns
5. **0 items resolved** since register was created Jan 22 (22 days, zero paydown)
6. **TD-005 (Slack)** should be promoted to P1 given 15+ day duration and impact on 2 modules

### Stale Items
7. **5 remote branches** likely deletable
8. **Agent Teams branch** still experimental, no merge timeline

## Recommendations

### Priority Actions
1. Advance Plotter Mechanix Phase 2 — ROI validated, push for sign-off
2. Add __pycache__ to .gitignore (quick win)
3. Refresh Slack tokens (blocks 2 modules, 15+ days)
4. Follow up Steve Tobey / Hawkwood — advance to proposal
5. Resolve at least 1 tech debt item (0/8 resolved in 22 days)

### Debt Maintenance
- Promote TD-005 (Slack) from P2 to P1 given duration
- Update DEBT-REGISTER with paydown dates when items resolve
- Consider weekly debt review cadence
