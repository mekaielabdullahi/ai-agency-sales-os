## Deliverables Created

### 1. Polished Phase 2 Proposal
**File:** `plotter-mechanix/proposals/phase-2-proposal-2026-02-13-polished.md`

**$100M Offers Framework Applied:**
- **Dominant Promise:** "In 6 weeks, give Alyssa back 20 hours/week and eliminate Kelsey's $91K/year in confused hours"
- **The Math (Upfront):** ROI calculation before any milestones
- **Success Criteria:** Each milestone has measurable "Success Looks Like" section
- **Clean Pricing:** $10K + $10K + $8K = $28K (3 paid milestones)
- **Stacked Value:** $10K training/SOPs/support included free
- **Risk Reversal:** 50% inbox reduction in 60 days or 60 extra days at no cost

**Conservative ROI Numbers:**
- Annual Value: $122,200 (was $207,440)
- ROI: 336% (was 641%)
- Payback: 67 days (was 49 days)

### 2. Excalidraw Roadmap Diagram
**File:** `diagrams/plotter-phase2-roadmap.excalidraw`

**Visual Elements:**
- Promise box (top, green background)
- Pain points → Solutions mapping
- 6-week Gantt timeline with 3 milestones
- Deliverables per milestone
- Pricing on each milestone bar ($10K, $10K, $8K)
- Success criteria boxes
- Guarantee callout (blue)

## Channels Updated

Per user request, removed Facebook from Milestone 2 channels:
- **Before:** "All channels (email, SMS, website leads, Facebook)"
- **After:** "All channels (email, SMS, website leads)"

Both proposal and diagram updated to reflect this.

## System State

### Skills (12)
- 10 operational
- 2 need configuration (client-feedback needs DB ID, notion-sync needs page IDs)

### Agentic Modules (15)
- 13 operational
- 2 blocked by expired Slack token (client-onboarding, slack)

### Blocking Issues (Carried Over)
1. **Slack token expired** — 21+ days, blocks client-onboarding module
2. **CLIENT_FEEDBACK_DB_ID** — Not configured in .env
3. **gamma-discovery-deck-prompt.md** — Untracked since Feb 5+
4. **`__pycache__/`** — Not in .gitignore

---

## Next Actions

### Immediate
1. Send polished proposal + diagram to Kelsey
2. Schedule kickoff call if approved

### This Week
1. Refresh Slack token at api.slack.com/apps
2. Commit gamma-discovery-deck-prompt.md
3. Add `__pycache__/` to .gitignore
4. Follow up Steve Tobey / Hawkwood LLC (discovery done Feb 6)

## Notes

- ExcalidrawZ app already installed via Homebrew
- User workflow: diagrams created in repo, opened via ExcalidrawZ app
- $100M Offers framework significantly improved proposal clarity and structure
