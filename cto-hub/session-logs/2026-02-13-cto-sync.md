## Deliverables Created

### 1. Polished Phase 2 Proposal
**File:** `plotter-mechanix/proposals/phase-2-proposal-2026-02-13-polished.md`

**$100M Offers Framework Applied:**
- **Dominant Promise:** "In 6 weeks, give Alyssa back 20 hours/week and eliminate Kelsey's $91K/year in confused hours"
- **The Math (Upfront):** ROI calculation before any milestones
- **Success Criteria:** Each milestone has measurable "Success Looks Like" section
- **Clean Pricing:** $10K + $10K + $8K = $28K (3 paid milestones)
- **Stacked Value:** $10K training/SOPs/support included free
- **Risk Reversal:** 50% inbox reduction in 60 days or 60 extra days at no cost

**Conservative ROI Numbers:**
- Annual Value: $122,200 (was $207,440)
- ROI: 336% (was 641%)
- Payback: 67 days (was 49 days)

### 2. Excalidraw Roadmap Diagram
**File:** `diagrams/plotter-phase2-roadmap.excalidraw`

**Visual Elements:**
- Promise box (top, green background)
- Pain points → Solutions mapping
- 6-week Gantt timeline with 3 milestones
- Deliverables per milestone
- Pricing on each milestone bar ($10K, $10K, $8K)
- Success criteria boxes
- Guarantee callout (blue)
- Included bonus callout (yellow)
- ROI summary (bottom)

## Channels Updated

Per user request, removed Facebook from Milestone 2 channels:
- **Before:** "All channels (email, SMS, website leads, Facebook)"
- **After:** "All channels (email, SMS, website leads)"

Both proposal and diagram updated to reflect this.

## Inventory Corrections

- **Skills: 13, not 12** — `/tasks` skill (commit `14fab1f`, Feb 9) was missed by the Feb 12 sync. Now added to skills-inventory.md.
- **Internal projects: 5, not 3** — `audit-beta-application` and `checklist-app-requirements` were not documented in any previous sync.
- **gamma-discovery-deck-prompt.md resolved** — Was flagged as untracked since Feb 5; confirmed committed as `13281a6`. Removed from issues list.
- **TD-004 corrected** — DEBT-REGISTER.md still said "8 n8n workflow exports" despite Feb 12 sync noting 15. Updated directly in register.
- **DEBT-REGISTER.md refreshed** — Was stale at 2026-02-03 (10 days old). Timestamp updated.

### Files Updated
- `cto-hub/CURRENT-STATE.md` — Full refresh with corrections
- `cto-hub/system-inventory/skills-inventory.md` — Added tasks skill, count 12→13
- `cto-hub/system-inventory/modules-inventory.md` — Timestamp refresh
- `cto-hub/system-inventory/agents-inventory.md` — Timestamp refresh
- `cto-hub/system-inventory/integrations-inventory.md` — Timestamp refresh
- `cto-hub/technical-debt/DEBT-REGISTER.md` — TD-004 count updated, timestamp refreshed

## Issues Found

### Carried Over (Unresolved)
1. **`__pycache__/`** still not in .gitignore (flagged Feb 9 — 4 days)
2. **Slack token** expired (flagged Jan 29 — 21+ days, blocks 2 modules)
3. **CLIENT_FEEDBACK_DB_ID** not configured
4. **GOOGLE_AUTH_TOKEN** not configured for notebooklm

### Debt Register Concerns
5. **0 items resolved** since register was created Jan 22 (22 days, zero paydown)
6. **TD-005 (Slack)** should be promoted to P1 given 21+ day duration and impact on 2 modules

### Stale Items
7. **5 remote branches** likely deletable
8. **Agent Teams branch** still experimental, no merge timeline

## Recommendations

### Priority Actions
1. Send Plotter Phase 2 proposal to Kelsey — polished proposal + diagram ready
2. Add __pycache__ to .gitignore (quick win)
3. Refresh Slack tokens (blocks 2 modules, 21+ days)
4. Follow up Steve Tobey / Hawkwood — advance to proposal
5. Resolve at least 1 tech debt item (0/8 resolved in 22 days)

### Debt Maintenance
- Promote TD-005 (Slack) from P2 to P1 given duration
- Update DEBT-REGISTER with paydown dates when items resolve
- Consider weekly debt review cadence

## Notes

- ExcalidrawZ app already installed via Homebrew
- User workflow: diagrams created in repo, opened via ExcalidrawZ app
- $100M Offers framework significantly improved proposal clarity and structure
